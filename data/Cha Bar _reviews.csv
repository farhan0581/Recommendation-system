Bhavna Bhardwaj,"Rated Cha bar is one of the cutest and the ppcket friendly place. With the good collection of books right by your side it also gives you a huge variety of yommy food and more 50 types of tea. Now me bieng me (comfused) did not try any tea bieng at cha bar but had hot chocolate instead. Now i went with my sister, and we bieng foddies tried the barbacued chicken sausages, chicken with tanduri sauce sandwich and yes the jelepino poppers, drank coffee and hot chocolate. We loved the food so we also packed some sandwiches for our way home. Everything that we ate was yum & inexpensive and it was inded a good place to sit and relax.",Rated 4.0,1,19,??
Neil Suri,"Rated Decent little place to go out with your friends if you're hanging out in CP and dont wanna spend much Food was good but nothing special about it, ambience was also good and the concept of it being attached to the Oxford library might interest some pe",Rated 3.5,31,178,??
SHILPA,"Rated Love coffee with english tea cake with your favourite book. Oh yeyyy this will be your favourite hangout place. Located in the heart of city one of the best book cafe. Simple decor but tasty food and VFM. I visited this place so many times but always want to come again. My sweet memories are associated with this place. Totally a MAD place for our MAD group.

My friends & Me",Rated 4.0,19,74,??
Shubhankar Gupta,"Rated The prices ! So low ! Being in cp you expect yourself to pay atleast 500-600 for a proper meal but not here. Settled in the corner of F-block on barakhamba road. This little tea shop is conjoined with Oxford bookstore and serves large portions of food and drinks (mostly tea) at obnoxiously low prices. Don't mistake the low prices for low quality. Trust me, you won't find find better fish and chips anywhere. Golden fried, popping hot, crisp on the outside, soft white flaky fish on the inside, top class tartare sauce - all for rs 120. Need I say more ? Strongly recommend - the fish and chips. Really go have it now. Please do yourself a favour.",Rated 4.5,11,47,??
Arushi Gupta,"Rated Nice happening place in the oxford bookstore. Simple and chirpy ambiance. Very decently priced. Good food, good books and good friends. Your day is declared good. Must visit for a nice, laid back afternoon. Achari chicken sandwich should be given a try.",Rated 4.0,30,120,??
Saumya Kaushik,"Rated I am hugely dissapointed by the service of this place. You just cannot hear your company talk because of the loud music, when a book launch or anything is happening at the place. You order an item on the menu and get ready to wait for the next half n hour. Guys! Just DO NOT waste your money at this place.",Rated 1.0,16,73,??

Riya Bahl,"Rated Cha Bar is my ideal cafe - it's edgy, creative and alive. The place switches from quaint to bustling throughout the day. Despite being a teeny tiny place as compared to its roomy counterparts all across CP, Cha Bar manages to stand out. The food is limited but whatever they offer, they make well. As the name suggests, the chais here are the real highlight with their endless list of options. It's a great place for loners, duos as well as small groups of people though I would advise against going in very large groups. The staff is helpful and polite despite being overworked due to the sheer number of customers that walk in. Their Tiramisu and Red Velvet Pastry are amazing. I'd recommend checking out their iced teas too.",Rated 5.0,5,3,??
Nitanshi Agarwal,"Rated Finally a bookstore cum cafe, where you can sip your tea and enjoy a good read! Well thats what Chabar used to be, now it has become more crowded and noisy. Nevertheless, their food is great and very affordable. It is a must try for people who love tea, and by tea I mean not just our chai. They have a great menu for teas, you will find it difficult to select one. I tried their peppermint tea and apricot fruit tea. Both were different in taste, and something that I have never had before. Their red velvet cake and apple pie is very humble, and gives a very home made feeling. They wont make you feel very full and you can easily two slices with a cup of tea and a good book. A must visit for every tea+ book+ cake lover.",Rated 4.0,22,19,??
Bhupesh Jatiani,"Rated Cha Bar, newest form of sipping your old favorite tea n coffee in an Ambience surrounded by books. So a perfect place for book and coffee lovers and too at lowest prices in Connaught Place. We ordered Masala Chai, Chocolate Cold Coffee, Jalapeo Poppers and Achari Paneer Tikka. Everything was made as authentic as possible and was delicious too. And this all under 500. It's a small place, so it gets crowded too often. The ambience is done tastefully. And I must say this place has become a recent favorite!",Rated 4.5,60,378,??
Foodielove,"Rated This cafe has two of my favourite things -books and tea. I had visited this place quite a few times and it was an absolute delight every time. The staff is attentive enough and the food is really delicious, their fish and chips was one of the tastiest I've ever had.

S.Madan,"Rated Cha Bar is one beautifully organised place filled with the hustle bustle of waiters taking swift rounds, music and chatter. The installations are eye-catching and their special blend coffee is marvellous, just perfect if you are more of a latte lover. The food is oka-ish and it might take some time for your order to appear on your table because of the heavy footfall in the cafe. You can sit in the book store and read. There is a circular light blue sofa, sift through the shelves for your favourite book and read! PS- you can't bring your own books.",Rated 4.0,13,39,??
Siddhant Gupta,"Rated Cha bar never disappoints. In my opinion, its the best coffee place in Central Delhi ahead of UCH, Starbucks, etc. It has a lot of food variety to offer along with a 9-10 page menu of different hot Beverages, & 90% of the times they'll all taste great! I enjoyed their Chicken Caesar salad a lot, the cold coffee and iced walnut carrot cake were yum too! Lot of waiting here at times, anywhere between 5 and 30minutes! Cost for two would 150-250 for a drink each and at max 550 for a proper meal! Highly recommend Cha Bar to everyone. (0.5 less than 5 because of the commotion caused by the book launches etc that take place often around here)",Rated 4.5,17,8,??
Vibhor Mathur,"Rated The place is cosy and has a bookstore next to it..which makes it interesting..we had ordered a chilli cheese toast and vanilla milk shake, and that was good..however the staff was extremely rude and gave cold looks whenever we asked them to take our order...so good ambience not so good hospitality.",Rated 2.5,4,2,??

Manika Dhingra,"Rated Situated inside oxford bookstore in the N block C.P., Cha Bar is a place for all the chai lovers. The menu has zillion variety of teas. Though i am not a tea lover, I still love this place as it has something in it which makes me go all nostalgic about my college days. I can never get tired of visiting this place. It is a small book cafe situated inside a library with simple interior. While my friends try different teas, i get my hands on small nibbles- bun maska, cha samosas, fry fry away, cookies pastries, pasta, ceaser salad iced teas and what not. This place is my fav breakfast/ brunch destination in cp.",Rated 5.0,4,63,??

Meenakshi Srivastav,"Rated Chatting over tea is always a great idea. If you have an addiction of reading and love for tea, this is the very right place. It is located in N Block, Outer Circle in CP. It offers a delish range of pizzas, sandwiches, desserts and a variety of tea/chai. I ordered Iceberg Club Sandwich and Cha Bar Coffee Blend which were really rejuvenating. The food was okay in general and the pricing was moderate. Overall this is a cool place to chill out with your gang on cup of tea or for a quick bite while its quite easy on the pocket. A great place for book lovers, chit-chatters and college gang get-togethers.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Hemant Pandey,"Rated The oxford library is not the only catchy point to visit Cha bar (but yeah an important one). The food here was no extra ordinary but the prices surely were very marginal and appropriate. You could have to wait for hours during the weekend. And yes, a heaven for the tea lovers. Staff was quite friendly too. Must visit.",Rated 4.5,21,121,??

You will find diversified crowd hanging out here for peace of soul. You have to wait for 10 mins to get a place to sit (busy hours). But as per me the wait is worthwhile.",Rated 4.0,36,391,??

Want to have red velvet pastry, cha bar is the place for you. This cafe is one of the most busiest caf/bar. Situated beside the oxford book store, it is a good place for all the book lovers. They have an elaborate menu, where in you can choose from pizzas, sandwiches, desserts and variety of teas/Chai. The ambience is a cool and elegant and the food is awesome. Everything that we ordered was amazing. After all the yummy food and endless chit chat you will realize that your bill is just so nominal. I loved this place. It is the perfect place to sip and hangout. This place is a complete package of great ambience, great food, and lovely experience.",Rated 4.0,17,242,??
Aakanksha Pundir,"Rated It's always a treat whenever I visit this place. Everything served here is amazing and of top quality from the never ending varieties of tea to salads, sandwiches and pastas. The menu is huge and will put you in confusion as what to order and what to leave. Not to forget are the delicious and healthy fruit smoothies which should definitely be tried, my favorite is blueberry. All in all its a place to definitely checkout whether you're hanging out with friends, colleagues or family. Do give it a shot!!!",Rated 4.5,2,0,??
Manpreet Kaur,"Rated I was particularly unhappy with the service. The staff was just roaming around and chatting with each other (and were quite audible) while there were a huge number of customers waiting for their orders. Due to the open kitchen and my table being right in front of their counter, I could see that they weren't serving even when the order was ready (cause they couldn't notice it due to the importance of their chat). Then my order wasn't complete. I wasn't informed that one of the things weren't in the inventory and half of that dish was served to me while rest was compensated with an ugly grin. Then even the chutney wasn't served which was clearly written on the menu. I had to specifically ask for it. Oh! Did I mention that my tea cup (no matter how cute it looked) was leaking? Like how much it costs to have good crockery? Don't think I would go to this outlet ever again. Maybe some other cha bar outlet. Sometime. finixpost.com",Rated 2.5,15,270,??
Suhael Buttan,"Rated Cha bar is a decent place to chill and is generally packed during lunch timings and gives you a stuffy feeling. The music is a bit too loud though. Coming to the food , we ordered fish and chips, white sauce pasta, chicken shawarma, cold coffee and a red velvet cake. The white sauce pasta was pathetic. It was too dry and bland. Fish and chips was quite nice though a tad too oily and the chicken shawarma was decent too. The red velvet cake was too sweet and creamy for my liking. If you're in cp during lunch hours and looking for a really cheap and easy on the pocket place, you can give this place a try though there are many more better options nearby.",Rated 3.0,29,128,??

Anu Jain,"Rated Going to this place was the worst possible experience. From food to service, everything turned out to be pathetic. We ordered ginger lemon honey tea, cappuccino, pasta. After a long time, we were served with ginger tea without honey and half cooked pasta. When we raised the complain to the staff, he was least interested; infact laughing n smiling. The staff seems to be untrained and irresponsible. This dirty, over crowded place is extremely hyped without any reason.",Rated 1.0,1,0,??
Sonia Batra,Rated Reasonable Nice ambience Too crowded Variety is an issue One can visit there for a cup of cha or coffee but not if hungry Service is not that great as well,Rated 4.0,19,14,??
Siddhartha Jaipuriyar,"Rated Placed right in the heart of the city is a unique cafe with in house library. The famous Cha Bar and Oxford bookstore are well known and need no introduction. The place is really attractive and has strong gravity towards itself. It is generally full house even in odd hours. Cha Bar which is mainly famous for its varieties of Chai has many other things to offer as well. The Burgers, Pastas and Shakes are what I liked the most. The shakes were excellent and quantity was more than satisfying for the price of mere Rs 70. Every item is very well priced and goes easy on the pocket. You can sit here for hours with a cup of tea and a gang friends. Must visit place! Ambiance - 5/5 Quality - 4/5 Quantity - 4.5/5 Value for money - 4.5/5",Rated 4.5,9,1,??
Komal Daal,Rated It was my favorite place to hang out alone. Visited more than 10 times. Awesome food and service and budget friendly. But waiters are rude as they ignore the customers table bookings when over crowded.,Rated 4.0,4,31,??
Vamsi Chaitanya,Rated Too loud and the service was very slow even when the crowd was less compared to weekends. The servers were clueless and rude about the order even after repeated reminders.,Rated 1.0,3,2,??
CurtistheWalrus,Rated I absolutely love the location. The Oxford Bookstore is a wonderful place to be at - and to read at. Cha Bar only makes going there seem even more appealing. They have a very indulgent tea menu and no matter what your tastes are - you're sure to find something. We had ice teas which were a little watery. The White sauce pasta was a complete disaster - nothing much to say for it. The shammi kebab sandwich was very good and the fish and chips were excellent (0.5 extra for that alone). They were too good to be true - a steal at the price. My friends and I have recommended it to countless people - all because of that brilliant fish dish.,Rated 4.0,20,7,??
Shagun Ahlawat,"Rated Well I dont know of many people who have not heard of this place, and I know of even fewer who have been here and not liked it. So I obviously had to go try out a place everyone seemed to be talking about. Cha Bar is in the Oxford Bookstore in CP. I have been here plenty of times and have thoroughly enjoyed every visit of mine. They have a phenomenal variety of food and especially beverages, for a bookstore caf. While you cant actually eat & read at the same time because the place is physically divided into two, the first half being the bookstore and the other part being the caf, the place is still a paradise for readers. I for one, love reading and therefore loving this place came naturally to me. The place is always buzzing with people either enjoying their food, or waiting for a table while browsing the large collection of books. And because the place is always flooded, the services are slow !! However, it is worth every bit. You can check out all kinds of books while you wait for a table, I guess that what works in their favor. Besides, the place is always decorated in different themes, making it easier to kill time while checking out their beautiful decorations. All in all, its a great place to chill at, without burning a hole in your pocket. I have tried various things on their menu, and I can only list a few of those that I remember, like Muddled Nachos, Mexican Cold Slaad in Whole Wheat Wraps, Bun Maska, Chilli Cheese Toasties, Blueberry Muffin, Red Velvet Cake, Apple Cinnamon Pie, so on and so forth. My absolute favorites are the Chilli Cheese Toasties & I also adore the way they serve the tea ! Do let me know if there are dishes on the menu that I am missing out on !",Rated 4.0,7,5,??
Hero And The Sage,"Rated So an year back when I had started going to college, my lust for books took me to Oxford Bookstore in CP; and that was when I found this little place which is inside the bookstore. I found it to be a perfect location to spend some time with a book and cha (tea). The location is perfect and the place is 60-70% occupied through the day from the very hour it opens. The interiors are basic and the only thing that catches your eye are the huge, round shaped, black frames hanging from the ceiling with lights which light up the place pretty well. Other than that each table always has a fresh flower waiting for you which instantly brightens up the table. True to the name, Cha bar has a huge menu which offers you A LOT MANY types of teas. Im not really a tea fan personally, but frequent visits here made me try quite a few teas out of their menu. So if you dont really know what exactly you want, then a menu this big can end up confusing you. To the rescue, there is always needed a team of well trained staff who can help you pick and cha bar has just the right team. Sadly, the drawback is that the crew members are quite slow in service. Other than just teas there are options of coffees, light snacks of various kinds and some desert options. Since Ive visited the place a lot many times, Id just sum up to what Id recommend. When it comes to tea Id suggest the Ginger tea, which is the regular tea with a hint of ginger; Organic Cha, which is the regular masala tea but is organic; and the Earl Grey tea which is not disappointing either. When it comes to coffee, I dont know why but the Iced Caf Latte is never available and leaves us with no option than settling with the regular cold coffee with ice cream. I really like the Spiced Cappuccino they serve which has a very mild flavour of cinnamon added to the regular cappuccino. The peach ice tea is good too. Do not order the pasta here, it just isnt impressive. If you just have a pasta craving then Id say you better step out and grab a table somewhere else in CP. They used to have a very good Achari Chicken roll in their menu which they served with fresh mint chutni but is sadly discontinued now. Other than that the Bun kebab is good. Desert, do not go for the Red Velvet here. Instead, prefer opting for the chocolate truffle. The muffins are just fine. The whole ambience of the place is always chattery and crowded which adds a little life to the silent bookstore. Cha bar ends up being an unconventional book caf with little to do with reading and more to people holding discussions. But Id still visit the place again and again because of my book bias which is the same reason why this place is so crowded all the time. When it comes to the pricing of food, it is surprisingly cheap and extremely light on the pocket. Two people can easily stuff themselves up in Rs.400-500 which is not a bad option at all.",Rated 3.5,9,43,??
Ankush Kochhar-Ak,"Rated I love this place because of two things first it's surrounded by books and second it's aroma. A place which is always crowded. Nice sitting area. Famous for the cha and with cha the gossip. Sandwiches are good, cha is nice , idlis are nice too. A place which one should often visit. And if you want to read books then this is the best place in the outer circle",Rated 4.0,61,55,??

Mohammed Farhan Khan,"Rated A very exquisite place, peaceful atmosphere, delicate girls chatting in their own delicacies, this place basically in Oxford book press shop, the other half of the space is extremely dedicated to books which are published by Oxford press. They made a very elegant interiors which make everyones jaw-stuck for a moment, wow thing coming out of the mouth. Beside this book store, there is small place known as 'cha-bar', they are good in coffee but they also serve some snacks like sandwich and all. I would not comment upon the taste since this place is not famous for exotic taste of its food. Go for oxford book store, its ambience and feel elevated for a moment with the books they keep surrounded with ardent readors trying to find some good books by reading its content.",Rated 5.0,23,27,??
Riddhi,"Rated For all those who love to read and be surrounded by books and enjoy a little snack just being there, this is a really good option. I had gone there with my dad as he was really excited about this place( happens once in a blue moon :P)We ordered a cha bar blend, a masala chai, and a bun maska as we just had lucnch. Honestly speaking there was nothing great about any one of them. The tea's were just okay, and I was expecting the buns to come with white butter and not the regular butter. Bun maska actually means bun with white butter. But the buns were all soaked up in the salted yellow butter. This place has nice ambience, with so many books to choose from. If you're a book lover, you should definitely pay a visit to this place, but I think tea lovers won't find anything great in here. But It's pretty cheap, so for a different experience, you can definitely pay a visit, who knows you might like it!",Rated 3.5,15,23,??
Vatsala Vats,"Rated Located inside the famous Oxford bookstore in CP N block, this place is a sheer delight! The interior is beautiful and gives you a very vintage feel. Limited seating and seems to be packed within no time especially during lunch hour. We were a party of 3 and we ordered: 2 cold coffees, 1 ice tea for drinks. For main course we ordered: Penne Arrabbiata (Vegetarian) , smoked chicken and mustard English tea sandwhich, chicken shawarma wrap and for dessert their chocolate truffle cake. The only disappointment was the pasta which was too bland and can honestly be avoided because they have a variety of other types of food available. The must try has to be the chocolate truffle cake which was simply delicious! Another high point about Cha bar is that it is so very reasonable and that for such little money you get a great food experience!",Rated 4.0,8,192,??
Nishtha Bhasin,"Rated Super place! Forever in love with their Kenyan Coffee and the insane cheesy snacks. And those little painted tea pots they serve tea in? Perfect.

Pragya Khanna Arora,"Rated Cafe with a book store...an amazing combination, but its not as good as the Calcutta one, seems like less a place for readers more for people just coming to cafe Food - Very good, soo many types of teas that it becomes confusing which to choose Loved their version of chilli cheese toast...must try Rolls & pasta were OK Tasty pastries Service The cafe is always running at full capacity, hardly an empty table. But the service is not upto the mark, slow service, had to ask for an extra spoon thrice, they have less staff for serving Tip -Its a place for meeting friends, relaxed atmosphere, best for a tea time meet",Rated 3.5,16,73,??
Divleen Kaur,"Rated A very beautiful bookstore cafe with interiors of black amd white and artistic chadeliers. The food is on the pricier side but my favourites are chilly cheese toasties, blueberry muffins, strawberry smoothy and assorted fries. I recommend this place for spending quality time over chitchat.",Rated 4.5,3,48,??
Akanksha,"Rated Cha Bar- A pretty little caf located inside Oxford Book Store, CP. However, it's not the typical book cafe where you can grab a book and sit with it inside the cafe while sipping on some tea or coffee. There's a separate section at the back if you want to read from the library. The ambience is lovely and the food is great with extremely pocket friendly prices. Cha Bar truly is a paradise for tea lovers, they have a HUGE list of teas to choose from. A few of my favourites are the Darjeeling High Fired with Kangra Spring, Bollywood Masala Mix Cha and Blackcurrant Iced Tea. The coffee is good too. The food here is a delight as well. It's nothing too fancy but worth the price you pay. I really like the pastas and sandwiches they offer. For desserts, you definitely shouldn't miss out on the flourless chocolate cake. The only con I find is that it's always too crowded, and I have to wait for at least 10-12 minutes to get a place to sit. And since it is a small caf, it does get noisy. Other than that I absolutely love Cha Bar and it is one of my favourite places to hang out and eat in Connaught Place.",Rated 4.5,10,112,??
Rohan Saraf,"Rated Found it on zomato, the zomato/google map sends you on the opposite road to a different building! Got there, had chai dessert and rolls which were average, ambience just ok, would have been better had it been an open coffee shop with books all around instead of an enclosed walled in cubicle of a room. The service was SLOW, busy yes but then seriously understaffed if u had to wait for 10 minutes just to get menus so not a place I would return to anytime soon.",Rated 2.5,58,139,??

Nandita Sharma,Rated Me and a bunch of my friends discovered this long back. What distinguishes this plcae from others is the fact that it is not a conventional book cafe . This place is always full however we always find a place and sit here for long hours and make our college notes because we gotta admit the fact that it definately has a comfy vibe. I personally dont enjoy the food much here But the beverages are worth a try. We have tried almost all the cold beverages n they are soothing. Aman Goel,Rated 3.0,31,38,??
Ananya Nandan,"Rated It is a perfect little place for any tea lover. The Earl Grey tea tasted fabulous, as well as the hot chocolate. I also had the basil pesto pasta and chicken chilli wrap.

Vaibhav,"Rated Hi Just went to this place for my 1st visit on 8th January & my take on this place in short are as follows. LOCATION & AMBIANCE This place is located in N Block Connaught Places outer circle nearby Barakhamba Road red light above adidas original showroom & adjacent to Oxford book store. Cha bar is an extension to the book store itself. However ambiance is well maintained, decorative & youll find it 80% occupied on anyday anytime. FOOD I have tried Hot chocolate coffee along with Tomato pasta during my recent visit. I find their hot chocolate coffee steaming hot with less sugar. So 9/10 for coffee & 7/10 for Tomato pasta which I really dont know but something was missing as far as taste is concerned with. Probably the spices were. HOSPITALITY Very impressive I must say. Crew members were on their toes, be it any task you named it & they gave their 100%. Definitely 5/5 for service. This is also evident from the fact that hygiene was taken at most care by these crew members. CONCLUSION If I rank them according to their peer competitors they are better than CCD anyday, but probably Ill give more preference to starbucks at this point. But more visit to this place is for sure. P.S : Rs. 250 was charged to us for couple of things which was paid by me via Cash . Bill is attached for your reference. I dont have any interest whatsoever in Cha Bar & amongst its owners. Cheers",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Nidhi Lal,"Rated The place is very nice. I liked the ambience. A place for readers, book lovers and chai-vinists. I'm a chai lover and this is the best place for any chai lover. A must visit place.

Dhruv Gupta,"Rated Cha bar is a pocket friendly cafe in the heart of city that serves amazing variety of tea, I come here every now and then. My favorites are the chicken celery sandwich and cardamom cha. Also, I enjoy the fish n chips once in a while. Looking at the growing popularity of tea and increasing number of tea lovers and tea serving outlets, cha bar needs to maintain its quality which sometimes seems to deviate a bit when the place is crowded. White sauce pasta, chicken sausages, red velvet are worth trying. Nice service, well spoken staff. Worth a visit!",Rated 3.5,64,48,??
Reetika Ralhan,"Rated Being a tea fetish, I have found the perfect little place. It's such a nice place. The interiors are pretty much simple which is fine. I visited this place with my friend and loved it. And the bill won't burn a hole in your pocket for sure. A good place for college students and book lovers since it's right next to the Oxford Bookstore. I ordered chilli chicken wrap, pesto sauce pasta, hot chocolate and my favorite earl grey tea. Every thing was delicious. The hot chocolate was good and Earl grey has now become my favorite. The food was nice and the ambience was good.

Leo Angelo,"Rated What a wonderfully quirky and fun place! Chanced upon cha bar while strolling through cp, and boy we were glad we did. With its wonderful collection of books to browse through and its humongous repertoire chai (seriously there's like 6 pages dedicated to some great chais), the experience was great! Ordered a Bollywood masala chai & a ginger tea (which lived up to their menu descriptions), a fish and chips (absolutely yum) and a hot dog (again, yum). Definitely would have wanted to spend more time here.

Jatin Dev,"Rated Very hard to find a table if you visit this place during snack time. And even if you do, it is so cramped up that you never really feel that the table truly belongs to you. So, while you ignore the loud conversation from all around you, immerse yourself in a pretty long and interesting menu. Tons of teas, ice teas, green teas to choose from. If That wasn't enough, you can treat yourself with pretty fairly cooked desserts and breads. The keema Pao isn't as fresh as you would get it in Mumbai but then the fish fingers is spot on. Add some red velvet cake at the end and you wouldn't find a hole in your wallet. Get a place and get on with your taste.",Rated 4.5,53,152,??
FoodiMentalist,Rated This place use to be my favourite really loved the ambience it had and food it served. So was very disappointed with the declining standard that I encounter on my recent visit. Dirty tables and totally unresponsive and non cooperative staff. I had to request them four times before I finally got the leaky straw replaced. The food totally mediocre considering the time they took serve it. I totally understand the kind of crowd this place gets which should be the reason for raising the bar and not vice versa.

Served in a very ravishing manner for instance oriental orthodox (Green/White/Oolong/Hand Rolled) tea served in the clay pots from that region.

Sunny Goel,"Rated I had heard a lot about this place and being a foodie, always wanted to try it. However, the food quantity didn't live up to the expectations. I went there with two localite friends from Delhi who had been to Cha Bar before. Based on their suggestions, we ordered some snacks. However, the quantity was lesser than half according to them. When we asked the waiters, they couldn't respond anything. & they took almost half an hour for preparing tea!After a disappointing snack (mainly due to the quantity and the time they took to serve it), we received a bill in which they charged us some 20 bucks extra for cold coffee with ice-cream which wasn't there in their menu and it was neither informed to us while ordering. Paying 20 bucks wasn't a big deal, but for some reason, we felt cheated. When we tried discussing this with the waiters, they got rude and were trying to convince us that when cold-coffee is 70 bucks (not sure about the amount), then cold-coffee with ice-cream should be more. We agreed to their logic, but we demanded that the same should be informed to us before hand. They behaved very rudely with us and even the manager said that they don't have to tell each and every thing to the customer and that this thing is understood. Our main concern here was that they could have had charged us anything as the true price according to the manager wasn't mentioned anywhere. They could have had charged us maybe a 100 bucks for the ice-cream in the coffee and we can't deny paying for it because apparently, they don't need to tell everything to the customer. We had a discussion with the manager and the manager talked very rudely with us saying that ""aap log shayad kabhi kisi ache restaurant me gaye nai ho"" and then telling to his staff ""mat lo inso 20 rupay...bheekh nai maang rahe hum log"". It was ethically wrong and really insulting to us as their customers. This has been so far the worst experience I ever had in a restaurant or snack bar.",Rated 1.0,4,0,??

It is a lively environment but inefficient. Not to call everyone mean, but I wish our waiters would have been nicer in their communication. We got an extremely stale mousse which they refused to accept was gone bad (at least eventually they were professional enough not to charge us for it), they were not responsive when called for (it's not like we're snapping our fingers or whistling to get their attention) and I know they are just there to do their job, but I realised how far the ideology of 'service with a smile' goes after seeing how supposedly pissed off they were at serving anyone (again, not all waiters but most). Still can't deny the good quality of their tea and filter coffee, but I've taken note that this isn't the first time here that the customers have been kinder than the service.

Amar Arjun,"Rated CHA BAR, it is one of those places which you eventually get addicted to and can't stop coming back if you are one those. And by one those i mean 'Someone who enjoys having a nice cup of coffee or tea, a good conversation and nice sandwich or pastry'. It is according to me THE BOOK CAFE , it is inside the OXFORD BOOKSTORE , come on ! what else does a book lover needs when they have this ! Coming to the place , located inside the Oxford bookstore on the right, the place is hardly ever empty and usually one has to wait for 5-10 mins to find a table. The interior is pretty lively and bright with WHITE & BLUE all around . The chandeliers are really amazing, i really like the concept of naked chandeliers and the ambience is amazing. The granite tables are a real nice touch with those single fresh flower on every table. Coming to the menu, I have been here at least 10 times so it is impossible to describe a single dining experience. I have almost tried their entire menu, so i will just tell what shouldn't be missed and what should be ! I really enjoy their coffees and shakes, the CHOCOLATE CAFE LATTE being my favorite and the ICED TEA being dreadful most of the times with an overpowering amount of tea. The VANILLA SHAKE shouldn't be missed, it was one of my favorite drinks there without the sweetness being too overpowering. The portions of the drinks are really good given the very modest pricing of all the drinks with a hot coffee costing 50-60 bucks, more than reasonable in an area like CP. Coming to the food, it has been a mixed experience. I really love their sandwiches, especially the CELERY,CHICKEN AND ICEBERG CLUB (CLUB SANDWICH) , it is really wholesome with the perfect amount of mayo and chicken and a fried egg to provide perfection to the dish. The CLUB SANDWICH is on the sweeter side, people who prefer a spicier sandwich should prefer MINT & CHICKEN TIKKA SANDWICH. But my all time favorite is the FISH & CHIPS, hot golden fried fish, fried to perfection with a perfection crunch on the outside and tenderness inside. The fish are sublime and simple in flavor served with a delicious TARTAR DIP and ample amount of CHIPS (French fries) to go with it. The KEEMA SAMOSA and CHICKEN WINGS should be definitely given a miss, they wings being the worst i have ever had in my life. The CAESAR SALAD should be should be definitely given a miss as well, with it consisting a very minuscule amount of chicken, too much mayo and a lot of lettuce. One cannot find any other ingredient apart from them and they never serve the croutons or sun dried tomato or the bread mentioned in the menu. The WHITE SAUCE PASTA is pretty average as well as the PIZZAS. Overall, this place is great for a good cup of coffee or quick bite and the quality of the food is quite justified given the modest pricing .",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Eat Style Shop,"Rated Bang opposite my workplace in CP, this place has been my favourite since a really long time now. A book-store cum restaurant is all we needed in Delhi. The best part about this place is that you can sit here for hours, read and eat. What else can one ask for? The only problem with the place is the space. Almost all the time, there is no free table. Though you can wait for one while strolling around in the store but it's not the ideal situation. Something that I love to eat here is the pasta and chicken wings. If you are a tea-person, this place is heaven for you. I love their mixed fruit Iced Tea.Again, a great place for people on a budget. Full paisa vasul!",Rated 4.0,20,5,??

Pankaj Negi,"Rated 3.5 for no fault of theirs actually, maybe a bit because of them. Read on! Amazing location for this tea room/cafe, one of the few book shop cafes that does really well. The kind of clientele they attract though is looking for a place to be at for cheap coffees and snacks. When they find such a place bang in the middle ( the outer periphery to be exact) of CP they come in teaming millions. This place is always brimming with loud youngsters clicking selfies and ordering chais. Their chais are great, I have developed a fondness for the truck driver ki chai, which is as strong and crisp as they come, the snacks are good too, small portions very reasonably priced, the onion rings are great so are almost all the sandwiches. Btw the desserts are fab too, the staff though is always having a tough time managing the show. They should go for a self service counter with automated calling, well ease out a lot of operational burden, and at least a couple of people should be manning the table waiting.

This place is too noisy because if so many people are going to sit and chit chat in a small area, it is bound to happen. Now coming to the food, veg platter was a disaster because of the quality of oil used for it (you could actually smell the foul aroma from pakodas). Grilled vegetable pizza is quite average. Fish n chips were not great too and there was too much sugar in both the ice teas we ordered (mixed fruit and blackberry).

Tucked inside the oxford bookstore, it is an amazing place to just chill & chat & catch up with friends. The ambience is quite young along with a good taste of music. We was there for about 2 hours & it was like time just flew. Coming to the food, the menu gives you an amazing choice with a long list of 'cha' & some finger licking snacks to go along with. Its quite reasonable so you can experiment with a lot of things. I tried the masala cha & cinnamon cha were was amazing!

Whenever you walk into this place, an unusual appetite develops automatically and the whole surrounding feels like a different country altogether. I have been visiting this place for years now, but this is the first visit with my parents and even they were in complete awe of this cafe cum bookstore. The cheap prices gave us enough freedom o order in plenty. My father experimented with tea and got himself a Darjeeling gold, a black tea. My mother went with a chocolate shake and I picked a hot chocolate. None of it was disappointing, and it shouldn't be, coming from a place with a name like cha bar. For food, we picked an achari paneer pizza, mixed vegetable roll and barbeque sausages. The food took a lot of time to come because of Sunday rush but once it arrived, it was welcomed with greedy eyes. And we finished up the delicious food quickly. The only thing I did not like was the roll, it had some weird stale vegetables in it. Finally, a red velvet cake. And no its nothing compared to the best of Delhi but it was okay.

It's amazing to have entire menu booklet for tea only.They cover the varieties of all the regions and tea leaves though most of them I never heard off before. I went there with my best bud. I tried kashmiri kawah tea a speciality from Kashmir for winters while my friend preferred to calm his throat with regular milk tea.Snacks were also fine along with tea.Well talking about the place and ambience its situated inside Oxford bookstore.Its such a small place that it looks a canteen of the book store.Its too over crowdy and very noisy.It will give you a feeling of your school corridors during lunch breaks.

Sonika Bisht,Rated Cha Bar is a small caf near Barakhamba Metro Station. Its little hard to locate as the board on the main road mentions the place as Oxford Book Store. The place is adjacent to the book store and has a seating capacity of around 20-25 people. This place is always bustling with people and finding a seat usually takes time. I have been here on three different occasions. They have a wide variety of Teas and snacks. This time me and my friend tried the Cold Coffee and Hot Latte along with the Red Velvet Pastry and English Tea Cake. The drinks were average and the main highlight was English Tea Cake.

Siya Thomas,"Rated So as i was strolling through cp me n my friend happened to check into cha bar mainly because we both live books and wanted to checkout the collection. So going directly on to the what i ordered : * Barbecued chicken sausages (3/5) They looked like little chicken fingers , perfectly spiced with barbecue. The chicken was chewy and good. * Bun kebab (4/5) So this dish was basically a kebab in the tikki form inside a little burger with chutney. And it was little, i liked this dish but it got vanished in 4bites ? . * Platter of chips with dip (4/5) This dish was actually a potato fry dish to be more precise. It had different forms of fried potatoes .. smileys , wedges , fries. It was a regular dish. * Fish and chips with tartare sauce (2.5/5) Being very honest, we ordered this dish coz we found a lot of people ordering it , and even though it was not a disappointment but still i was not full happy. Only the outer crispy layer of the fish had taste , i wish the fish was more of flavour and it was served with regular fries along with tartare sauce which i found was yummy. * Cold coffee with ice cream It was a regular cold coffee nothing special about it. * Tiramisu This was as well a regular delight but it gave a smile in the end on my lips. But i have to admit that more than the food i feel in love with the book section. Over all this place is a nice place to have a good chat with your friends over snacks.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Fresh Lime Soda,"Rated So, they changed their location. And along with the location, what change do you expect, when you walk into an 'one of your favourite places'? If you ask me, nothing. Simply because, many a time, change takes away the reasons behind making a place, one of your favourites, at the very first place. To say that I was disappointed with this place, will be an epic understatement. Once in, we ordered our age-old favourites. Ginger Cha and 100 mil ki Cha. As the name goes, the Ginger Cha is supposed to have that awakening flavour of Ginger and 100 mil ki Cha is to be that robust, full-bodied Cha that keeps you going for long. Along side, we ordered bread toast, to go along with the tea sips. So, the tea comes. First, the colour of the tea, one of my foremost look-outs, makes my heart sink. And then the first sip, confirms my fears. The glass of 100 mil ki Cha, was nothing more than brown coloured water, the one that we used to have while dipping/washing our brushes, while painting water colour landscapes as kids. On second thoughts, I decided to have a sip of the Ginger Cha. Ah, even worse. Both the teas had their basic promised ingredients missing. Ginger and Masala. Not only that the teas figured amongst the worst I ever had, but also, made the evening kinda damp, for us. And yes, being an Assamese, I'm a bit sentimental, when it comes to teas. Now, our toast. It was served to us. Only that it was served to us, after 45 minutes of serving the teas. The teas were left to get cold on the table and the toast was left untouched. Service? On complaining about our respective teas, what we got to hear was that this is how these teas are made, for our kind information. So, did we have anything else to say, apart from a polite thank you, for the enlightenment? Maybe no. Also, when we wondered the reason for the delay in serving the toast, the prompt reply was, 'Sir, you can see, how many we have to serve.' Ah, delighted to know that. Ambience? The charm of picking a book and flipping through it, amidst sips of your favourite beverage was left behind, along with the old address. Now, it's just another tea shop, brewing and serving some really bad beverages, with even worse service. Save yourself a morning, afternoon or an evening.

Hungry Khan,"Rated This place has seen a remarkable transition from being a bookstore which didn't let people sit peacefully and browse books to a hugely popular dining place. It's giving serious competition to the other restaurants in CP and has really upped its game in the food segment. So now people come here to eat rather than to buy books, which is fine by me, but not too good for the culture of reading in Delhi (which is another story altogether and not suited for this platform). The last time I came here, the place was almost empty and the waiters didn't let you sit in the cafe and browse a book. Now if you go there, you'll see a tonne of customers sitting in the restaurant, not one of them reading a book. It's become a standard coffee shop now. Seeing such a huge crowd, we decided that the food must be good. We ordered the following: Fish and chips: generously served with three big fish slices and a sparse bunch of French fries. They give it with a white Mayo sauce but no lemon. For the price they are charging, I'm alright with the quantity. The fish was fresh and soft and well cooked. Lamb rolls: basically a lamb seekh kebab rolled up in a wrap/tortilla served with white Mayo. Quite tasty for sure. Enough for a light snack. Samosa sandwich: really filling and quite delicious. Broken samosa served in toasted bread. Reflective of the famous Bombay snack. Served with tomato ketchup and enough for two people. Beverages: Cold coffee: tall, strong and refreshing (hey that could be used to describe a potential suitor ;) Zesty lemon iced tea: super refreshing though I could taste some honey in it. I'm not complaining! Rum tea: my friend ordered it and he liked it. Served in a big pot so good for two people. They add rum flavour to the black tea. Waiters were a bit hassled because they were serving a huge bunch of people. But when asked for stuff they were pretty efficient. Ambience: a bit too cramped and very hot! They need to expand the space and maybe add an open seating area. Will go back when it's not so crowded.",Rated 4.0,75,847,??

We ordered cinammon cappuccino, hot chocolate for little one, and me being more of tea connoisseur, orderes kashmiri kavah. Plus basil pesto sandwhich, green tea cake and apple cake. Mom liked her cinammon cappuccino, sister gulped her extra sweet hot chocolate and i was sitting enjoing my big authentic looking jug of kavah. It comes with a small glass so you have to keep refilling it if you really are in the mood to finish the jug of tea. First two glass tasted awesome, after that the tea became way too bitter for my taste due to oversoaked leaves in the pot. Sandwhich was good, green tea cake was good. I would avoid apple cake from next time. Not my type. Well all in all it was a good time pass. I guess delhi winters will definitely require more of such places. So do visit it and enjoy their vast varities of tea with chat and snack",Rated 3.5,8,793,??

To my amazement, on multiple requests when the 'obviously indifferent' waiter did get me the sauce, it had mosquito in it. Guess the cha bar is more 'chi' bar now.",Rated 1.0,5,0,??

Udit Maini,"Rated Let me put this straight, OXfORD publications realised the potential of a small cafe besides a library, serving a large variety of tea(basically which gives it the name 'chai' Bar) and accompaniments ranging from soups to some mouth watering deserts.Now the food is amazing irrespective of what you order.Comfortable seating. Amazing ambience.I believe they are expanding the seating area which is great given the rapidly increasing clientele of readers visiting the place more often.POOR SERVICE during rush hours disappointed me the most.Took ages for the food and beverages to be served.But definitely worth the wait.Now the worst part is (which literally would drive you insane) that they don't serve waffles to adults(W.T.F!).They or on the children's menu and an adult just cannot get them! But if you consider the price point and the food taste and quality,it's more than a decent place to sit ,relax and read.Do VISIT!!! Happy hunting :)",Rated 4.0,7,56,??
Divya Kalra,"Rated So having the Oxford bookstore is what contributes the most to the essence of Cha Bar . I visited it today for the first time and my first reaction was ""Why haven't I come here before?!"" The staff is friendly , the place is crowded , the variety of teas is VAST and the presentation of the same is fantastic . The teas and dishes are decently priced . The place has a vibrant feel to it. I ordered an 'Aksha' tea that was a blend of versions Indian herbs served with honey in an interesting way . It left me feeling refreshed and distressed . Though its difficult to buy a book and read it in Cha bar due to the noise and crowd , the place is a must must visit . I just found a place for some self time , where I can treat myself with variety of teas and light dishes as well as grab myself a book . This place definitely comes across as . a stress buster !",Rated 4.5,60,195,??
Shubham Ujlayan,Rated I was as out of place at cha bar as a hot cheerleader at a satsang ceremony. I hope RSS don't make a deal out of it. For someone (me) who is not a fan of beverage and book this is a boring place. Its quite noisy and waiting time to get in can be high. The shakes was good. Pasta and sandwich was average. After trying red velvet pastry i was like wt did i just eat. It was really aweful - as aweful as Shahid Afridi (i am a huge fan of lala) trying to defend a ball.

The place is perfect for anyone like me who loves books and food ! They have a wide variety of teas as well that are served in the most lavishing manner And most of them are amazing . We tried the organic lemon tea and the chai blend . The chai blend was a little upsetting but the organic tea was just perfect . We also ordered basil pesto and vegetable panini . It was crisp and had the perfect flavour . The staff is well dressed and presented . The service was quick . The only loophole was it is always very crowded and it is difficult to find the place to sit here . The chairs are not comfortable at all.

On the enterance they have a beautiful wire tree full of reviews from people, it looks beautiful and then you are surrounded by wonderful books the moment you enter this place. What more can you ask for? Coming to the food, the food is awesome. Evrything that we ordered was amazing. The only turn off about the place is that it is so packed, and with only few people to serve, it takes alot of time for your food to arrive. But trust me its worth the wait. Mean while you can enjoy a nice chat with your companions. We ordered Fish and chips. Though its a very repetetive order but this fish and chips are different from anything you might have ever tried. The fish was so tender and yummy and the quantity was fairly enough. Next was paneer pizza, very different styled, refreshing pizza it was. The lime soda we ordered was hugeee and tasty.

My all time favourite samosa sandwich was a pale reflection of what it used to be. Other items weren't as good either. Plua the staff isnt courteous and forever to serve you.

Half of the items on the menu are ""not available"". Staff couldn't be more uninterested and annoying. Ofcourse, everything seems overpriced for the poor quality that is served. On my last visit each of the items I ordered was unavailable, and each time the server asked me to change the order saying that except for that dish, everything else was available, only to have me change my order 4 times. I don't know why they just don't redesign the menu. Finally tried the Tiramisu on the manager's insistence, who assured me was a must-try. Turned out to be rubbery and elastic. Left with a bad mood and a bad taste in my mouth, no thanks to the horrible tiramisu. An earlier visit with friends was just as disastrous, and ended up with us moving to another cafe.

Anuj Gupta,"Rated This place is primarily about books, and chai (tea), going essentially by the concept of having a tea shop in a bookstore. While its earlier version, the one in Statesman building, lived up to its name, the present one looks more of just a piggyback on the brand name created over the past few years. 1. Books - I visited the cafe a couple of times with a hope of catching up on some good books and a nice tea and whiling away the spare time I had. However, the response was same every time - ""You can't take books to the cafe section!"" I couldn't really grasp and had to reconfirm what they said. Apparently, the idea was that their new books get dirty. Fair point, but then why even call yourself bookshop with a cafe or vice-versa. Can't even read your own books coz those are not allowed by the security guard only! So much so for a bookshop-cafe! 2. Tea - A quite extensive menu with a number of teas and infusions. I was happy to see a white tea in the menu, one of the most premium varieties and not found at many tea cafes in Delhi. Cha-Bar scored a plus 1 there. However, upon ordering, I saw my delicate and earthy white tea getting boiled to a quick death right in front of me. After exchanging a couple of words with the staff on the preparations, it was clear that they know that they stock a number of tea leaves and herbs, but don't know how to brew a tea. This place has been struck out of my go-to places for teas cum books, but the eatables were fine, even if not delectable. Only good part was that it was peaceful, if you wish to work over a cup of 'okay' tea, or coffee.",Rated 2.5,79,453,??

To get to the Cha bar, you need to go through a book shop (Oxford Book-shop) and once you get to it, your perception of a cafe shall change. It is a relatively small space but designed in a really nice way. I tried out their ice tea and blueberry muffin and both the items tasted really nice, especially the blueberry muffin was really good - warm, soft & just perfect. They have a lot of varities of tea & coffee (especially famous for their tea, and hence the name), and the ambience adds to the entire experience.

Sawan Chalise,"Rated Cha Bar - Wah!! Chai.... Mostly full on a weekday and jam packed on weekends, Cha Bar is an outstanding cafe, situated right next to the Oxford Library at the outer circle of Connaught Place. Cha Bar is the perfect place to sip and read, or just sip into some delicious hot and cold beverages. The place is seen overflowing with young vibrant crowd during the weekends and the number of people who actually come for the library is hardly any compared to the ones who are here for Cha Bar. What exactly triggered the fame of Cha Bar to rise at such overwhelming levels is still a mystery to me, but Cha Bar is definitely one of the best pocket friendly cafes in entire CP. Cha Bar basically is known for their large variety of tea and lesser variety of coffee. Apart from tea - pasta, pastries, sandwiches and other quick bites make up most of their menu. But what I love the most here is the Nepal Tea. It's like the usual black tea, only more tastier. The Assam Tea is another of my recommendation and a must try. But is Cha Bar perfect in every aspect? Definitely NO. The Cafe is too tiny compared to the popularity it has risen to. The service is extremely slow at times and you actually will want to leave the place due to the lack of attention that you receive here. But again, Cha Bar makes it up with their pretty decent and bright ambience combined with a some young, high spirited, enthusiastic employees, who give their best. The tea and snacks and the presentation too make it a worthwhile visit. Food - 4.5/5 Service - 3/5 Ambience - 4/5 Value for money - 4/5 Overall - 4/5 Cost for two - 450 Note: Cha Bar is one of the favorite spot for every youngster familiar with Connaught Place. It is a gem that gives more and takes very less in return. A must must visit for certain. Wish the place could have gotten much bigger.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Anupriya,"Rated Horrible service. They don't serve what's on the menu. Ordered a samosa which said on the menu that it'll be served with tamarind chutney but they gave tomato sauce instead. So we asked and they said they don't have tamarind sauce so we said okay can you give us mint chutney and they said sure but we will charge you extra for it. Then ordered a pesto and grilled vegetables panini. It said on the menu it comes either on white, foccaccia or multigrain bread and plain/toasted/grilled. The server said it only comes in white bread and then added ""and maybe brown bread"" as an after thought. Which was acceptable. There was no mention about the grilling or toasting. But the worst part was, there was NO pesto. He said it would have basil leaves and pesto. The sandwich was basically a huge amount of mayonnaise and traces of bell papers. Again, we were charged more for a tiny amount of mint chutney. The server also brought us a wrong order at first. Been there three times and been disappointed all three times. Not gonna give them any more chances.",Rated 1.5,5,3,??

Coming to Cha Bar, ambience - its a quiet place with white furniture (that's how it looked like when I went a couple of months back) I really like the place how it is always surrounded with the intellectual crowd and you get all the space you need. Coming to food, I wonder why most of the times they do not have many things as mentioned on the menu. If you cannot give, just don't mention no? Even on a Sunday morning say only 12 pm, ordering a few stuff came with a reply, ""sorry ma'am, we don't have this right now!"" The quality of the food is quite good, a caeser salad with just the perfect flavor of caeser is one great to taste unlike other places where they put in too much of caeser making it too tangy or sour. Just in case if you're thinking to try out parantha, please don't if you're looking out for a perfect north Indian flavour, they are good but lack authenticity. Sandwiches are good and not to mention the ""Bollywood Chai"" that is one amazing thing - starting from the kettle with all the Bollywood coming on the kettle itself and the flavour is great as well. The cutting chai glass is another cherry on top. In short, more like a cafe, the place is a great to hangout with a friend for an amazing evening surrounded by books.",Rated 4.0,58,178,??
Nikita Mukherjee,"Rated A perfect place to relax, catch up with your friends or go on a date. Cha Bar has this old school and magical charm about itself. It's a venture of oxford book store so that makes it cafe + book lounge. When I entered the place, I felt like I entered some cafe in London :P ( literally). The place provides a very intellectual but at the same time a very refreshing environment. Cha Bar as the name goes is a good place for having tea. They provide you all varieties of tea ranging from organic to flavoured and diet tea etc. However, the food over here is not much upto the mark but satisfies your appetite for the time being. Overall the place is a perfect lil getaway for taking a break in the hot afternoons of Delhi :) And it's very pocket friendly too !",Rated 3.5,6,16,??

A combination of a book store cum cafe makes it a must visit. Pocket friendly as well. Yess u would have to wait for some to grab your seats as the cafe area is quite small nd u would get a waiting time of 20-30 mins specially in the evening.

Alin Choubey,Rated Writing a review for a place with many reviews is tough as most of the things are pointed out already. I visit this place very frequently not because of anything related to the restaurant but the Oxford Book Store. The outlet is small and mostly pack with avid book lovers. Food is nothing out of the box. Small bites mostly. Place is not for peace lovers unless its empty of course. Service is good except the speed.,Rated 3.5,24,16,??
Sandeep Choudhary,Rated Cha bar is a place to visit for book worms. You can pick books from adjacent store and read while enjoying tea or coffee. Space crunch is there and sitting not so comfortable.

With plenty of books near by, one could just pick his/her favorite book and enjoy while having some delicious snacks and tea. Tea is one thing in the world which falls into my daily routine without fail. The first time I was overwhelmed by the sheer varieties of tea made available here. To top it, the prices are absolutely reasonable. If you don't have a palate for tea, try sticking to the Indian ones. Ginger tea is my favorite. Perfect place for a Sunday Brunch.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Mohini Negi,"Rated Looking for some cheap coffee/ cha amidst some great novels, then this is the place. Always buzzing with people this place offers various varieties of teas and compliments. The green tea was refreshing and the samosa sandwich was different and filling. The carrot cake was high on presentation and average in taste. Can visit this place again and again, their huge drinks menu will always provide you more choices than you can think.",Rated 4.5,26,64,??
Suyash Sinha,Rated I'm gonna come right to the point. I've been here 5 times and the one thing that is constant is poor hospitality. These guys are in the service industry and they have no idea how to treat their customers. They mix your orders. Refuse to change even if they screw up. Have no idea about managing a waiting que. And the worst of all the staff is downright rude. Perhaps the only reason this place is thriving is coz of the cheap prices and good location. I will definitely not recommend this place to anyone.,Rated 1.0,9,62,??

Although it can be really noisy during evenings so I generally go in morning.

Otherwise, it's a hit!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Gunjan Hans,"Rated Cha Bars have the advantage of being situated inside the Oxford Bookstores. For a book lover, what better combination than all those books and a nice cup of tea.

I find the place a bit expensive, but then it's the quality and the book store that makes me go back.",Rated 3.5,47,390,??

On Rocks,"Rated I think this is same joint that opened at priyas couple of years ago, but not 100% sure. This is located @ CP right opp statesman building. Its kinda hard to find, I wish they put more directions to entry & boards to locate where they were. Crossing CP Cha Bar block, we wanted to visit but since this is shut @ around 9 we could never make it. So on one fine weekday with some time to kill, we decided to give it a shot. There is no lift, so you will have to take the stairs. The entrance is not short of awe to a book lover. Feels like a English bistro with all good authors sitting for tea to discuss their book, but this quite close to the opposite. You pass through the library of books & enter cha bar the chaos begins. The crowd a mix of students to professionals to corporate ivy leagues there is a good chance if you are likely to meet someone you know if you travel in media related circles for the why I dont know. Their menu has a good variety of options from sandwich to pasta & of course different options in Tea. We settled for a sandwich & 2 cups of tea to begin our intellectual session. The order arrived after 30 min, with sandwich not grilled & tea slightly cold. Making me wonder if our sudo intellectual session gave away & we should resume to common chit chatSoon it became a ordeal to constantly ask the waiter to confirm about or order & begin our evening after much ado, it was here. The cha was just cha cha or should I say nothing out of ordinary there is a reason why I prefer coffee, they know what makes the difference. The sandwich was just Ok. The experience was definitely new with natural light ambience and lots of books, but not a spot I would go on purpose to re-call the bad experience about food & average chai. Coming to the end, would I visit again may be, would I recommend to visit only if you are a book lover. Is it worth it - indecisively yes, prices are not sky high & you can always try another chai. I hope you are able to make a choice 1.5 for ambiance, 1 for books & nice library .5 for food & .5 for service.",Rated 3.5,56,203,??
The Intrepid Eater,"Rated This used to be a favorite haunt back when it was still in Statesman House. The menu is still wonderful (oh do I love their teas- and the quirky pots and cups they come in are also fantastic) but the service seems to have taken a steady dive. Especially during the afternoon it can be quite crowded and the wait for your food or drink might be a long one. Although it's located in the Oxford bookstore, based on the number of people and decibel level, quietly reading a book there wouldn't be an easy task. Also, note that you have to leave books brought in from outside downstairs with the guards and I'm not sure about their policy regarding going through books from the bookstore while sitting in the cafe, unless you've just purchased them. And refusing to refill a teapot with hot water (reusing the tea leaves)- not cool. As long as it's before noon, one could still go in for the tea. The grilled vegetable Panini is also nice, but other food seems to be hit and miss so I might just give it a miss for a bit.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Gaurav Wasan,"Rated From Statesman building to now the outer circle of Connaught Place, Cha bar has been in the market since very very long and has held a very reputed market since then, from the quality of the food to the aromatic teas to the lovely ambiance Cha bar is amongst one of the top cafes in Delhi and this is a place you will absolutely adore if you are suffering from Bibliophilia, (Bibliophilia or bibliophilism is the love of books, and a bibliophile is an individual who loves books.). Imagine you sipping a hot cup of your favourite tea and alongside reading your prized book, this is a match definitely made in heaven, isn't it. Whether one prefers a rich, strong flavour, or a light fragrant taste, Cha Bar offers a wide and enviable choice. This place is known for in house library and wide variety of teas and for those who are visiting this place for the first time, Cha bar is now bang opposite Statesman building or if I can say in other words it is in the same vicinity where Oxford book store is. Cha Bar is the first of its kind urban contemporary space and the moment you step up into this small little cafe the aromatic and fragrant smell is sure to give you an experience you won't forget in a jiffy and if you are a lover of tea just like me, you will exactly know what I mean. The ambiance is done very beautifully in shades of white, black and blue and a little space for open kitchen where all the magic happens is in one corner. A beautiful writing on the wall which reads drinks, eat and surf is as apt as it can get. The natural colours of everything around generate a serene, placid, refreshing and a comforting environment for everyone settled to sip their tea. The lighting has been done in a very subtle way with huge round lamps spread across the area. On a day when you find an empty table here you should seriously thank your stars. This place is jam packed almost every time I have been here. Being a tea lover and in search to try something new each time I tried their Arabic spice which is a cultural preparation and the menu says it is from the land which is famous for a thousand and one nights story telling from where comes a blend that tells a tale of its own. The tea really was aromatic with a combination of cardamom, nutmeg, ginger, all spice, black pepper and cloves which turns this black tea into a seductive experience of its own. I loved the way this was presented to us. In a brass copper kettle with some very eye catching cups along. It really made me feel like a Maharaja for once. I also ordered the very famous masala chai, this says on the road to dhaba chai perfection, this lively mix of exotic spices is the last stop- this is was mix of clove, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and a hint of black pepper. If you are someone who doesn't love experimenting much should then stick to this one here and the best part is that it is just for Rs 35/- only. To fulfill my hunger pangs along I ordered, a smoked chicken and mustard sandwich where the chicken as per them is smoked in apple wood and is them mixed together with a tinge of english mustard in white bread. The bread wasn't grilled from the outside and I believe the chicken wasn't cooked properly either. I personally didn't like it much. I also ordered the very special bum omelette which I absolutely loved. An omelette sandwiched in between the burger bun and topped with some mayo is a treat in itself. Loved the bun really, it was super soft and at the same time very fresh too. One thing I hated the most about this place is the service, it is actually getting from bad to worse. Agreed the order is taken as soon as you are settled down but the time to get the same on table may vary from anywhere between 35-40 minutes and even for that you will have to remind them million times. The pricing of the place really needs a special mention. Very very reasonable and trust me you will leave from here with a happy face in terms of pricing. Happy eating :)",Rated 3.5,107,2035,??

Ridhi Monga,"Rated First off, I will always judge the new cha bar by the standard of the old Oxford book store/cha bar that was located in statesman house, which I feel was better in terms of ambience, interiors (nice and cozy) and service. That set aside, I love the idea of being surrounded by books in a restaurant/cafe. And this place is one of a minority in Delhi that give you that ambience. What's more is the prices on their menu, so cheap that you feel that perhaps you are not in CP anymore but some alternate universe. I would recommend the fish and chips. They are absolutely delicious. :)",Rated 3.5,30,29,??

Just Rs 50 on average for a tea or coffee at such a cafe. Where do you get that in CP? Hot chocolate is yummy. Food portions/quantity is perfect considering prices and the location.

Satyapriya Siddhartha,"Rated Okay, so Cha Bar. Essentially a book store coffee shop. It could be a library cafeteria, the way it's situated. Which is not a bad thing as on more than one occasion, I rushed here to start a book that I just bought. So that's one thing they've got going for them The rest is okay. It's sort of dark in here. Yes, some people prefer fluorescent lights and think it's an adequate replacement for natural light. I'm not one of them. The seats could be a bit more comfortable as well. Now, about the food. On the few occasions that I have been here, I have been thoroughly enchanted by their teas. The Tiger Hill Nilgiri Tea stands my favourite. Plus the Samosa Sandwich is quite something. Even though the Samosas could have been better, so I would really ask people to go for the Samosa Sandwich. The Fish and Chips is a good option too, well made. Also, try the Muddled Nachos and the Organic Cha. The combination works way better than I expected it too. But to be very honest, the heroes of this place are the Nilgiri Teas, both of them. And the best part is that they are well priced. Not overtly expensive and something you can drink again and again. I once drank six Tiger Hills (and I'm proud of it). But stay away from the coffees. It's the teas here that will make you come back here, the coffees are, at best, average. And that's saying something, because after Craigmore, I had a lot of hopes with their coffees. Just so you know, they disappointed me with it. Although the blame is on me, expecting good coffee by drinking tea. In recent days however, let's say two months or so, it seems to be on a downward spiral. The tea is no longer the tea I expected from them, and the service is rather underwhelming. I can only hope that this is a phase, because I really like this place and would hate it if it goes bad. Also, a note to Oxford: START STOCKING IAN FLEMING. I've been there so many times and they never have that. And now it's become a test for me.",Rated 3.5,5,4,??
Rakshika Kaul,Rated A must visit for people who like reading. Ambience is nice. Food is nice. They have undoubtedly the best teas.

'P',Rated It's a small place with a good amount of seating. The ambience is nice and its a fun place to visit. We started with a fish and chips and masala chai and lemonade. The fish and chips were nice and the masala chai tasted good too but it was the lemonade that stole my heart and taste buds. The lemonade tasted fresh and refreshing one of the best I have had in and around Delhi. We then ordered keema bun and keema samosa which were nice too however too oily. Their sandwich should be tried at least once since we happen to enjoy it very much. Overall a good experience however the menu needs a little tweaking here and there.,Rated 4.0,77,676,??

The place, for anybody who loves to READ, EAT, DRINK and enjoy a good conversation is all good things in one. We went there and were greeted with friendly smiles, already mesmerized with the view of Oxford... I wont call it a book cafe as it is crowded and super noisy, which personally I dont prefer while reading. It was around 6 in evening and the place was full. The place was small and the kitchen was near entrance. We managed to get a table... If one is in the need of coffee and if one feels hungry there is always an option of having a piece of cake.

Tried ""tandoori black pepper panner kathi in lachha parantha"" wraps, ""bun maska"" burger and ""Cha Bar's special thandai"". I absolutely loved the wraps and thought it to be worth the money it costs. Thandai was good too. But the ""bun maska"" which was written under ""burger"" section is not burger at all.

Natasha Ahuja,"Rated Cha Bar as the name suggests is a bar of cha's. Located at the outer circle. This place is situated on the same floor as Oxford Book Store. It is a cute little place which serves some pocket friendly food. They have plenty of drinks to chose from. Tried the Truck Driver tea. It was very refreshing and stood up to its word. Then tried Chicken Sausages , Non veg platter and Chicken Grilled Sandwiches. Really liked the sausages. They were good in taste. Non Veg Platter was however average it also had sausages,keema samosa and chicken wings. Wings tasted really bad. I liked the Grilled Sandwich. It was very light and was grilled perfectly was delectable in taste. This is one place where one can simply read a book and have a cup of chai. They also had a couple of desserts on the menu will surely be trying those next time.",Rated 3.5,31,226,??

Bindiya Jain,"Rated I have been coming to Cha Bar since I was an under-grad student, I remember when it was in the statesman building. the concept of a book store and a coffee shop was novel and appealing. We made this place our hangout. We had countless glasses of green tea margarita l, Bhajia basket and their sandwiches. We were all so disappointed when it closed down and eagerly awaited it's reopening across the road. The prices remain what they were 7-8 years ago, the menu is about the same. The place is always packed, waiters are always harried, but this place is part of the Delhi story, we have attended pop concerts, talks on feminism by Gloria Steinem and countless other vital conversations. And always, along side a reliable, sturdy cup of tea served in a cup holder shaped like a monkey, you hold it's tail and sip.

The sandwiches were very presentable and tempting... But the breads used were not very soft and the filling wasn't satisfactory...

Among which we liked only passion fruit and rolls. Rest everything was not even average tasting. Chicken Pasta was flat with no taste at all and colud only taste boiled chicken. Veg pasta was fine. Cold coffee was as bitter as I could never digest. On the top, staff wasn't able to understand what we were saying. Hence, they could not respond to it. Keeping food and staff apart, I liked the idea of their simple menu with a huge variety of tea ( I didn't order though).

I mean maintaining an inventory is not in their rule book for running a cafe! I can see the humongous crowd they cater to and it keeps flowing in but that doesn't give you an excuse to not serve people well. You know the numbers that flock in every day then why don't you guys stock up. Apart from that, whatever you may order it won't be delivered to your table any soon, you keep waiting and then you have to remind them for your order even if it's something as small as a cup of tea.

Apurva Setia,"Rated So I usually visit Cha bar just to meet friends over a cup of tea/coffee, since they have a great variety of teas. Its a heaven for tea lovers. They have almost all flavours possible. The place has a really good vibe since its located right in the middle of the bookstore. Hence its quiet and nice and you can easily talk to each other unlike all the other places these days which prefer to put really loud music. It's the first time I ordered anything other than tea since I ended up meeting somebody for lunch there. I've only tried the quiche and muffins before which are pretty good. To start with, we ordered the cold coffee which came in big glasses with ice cream and chocolate sauce. It had the right amount of coffee and sugar for me. Was neither too sweet nor did it have a very strong coffee flavour which works for me perfectly. Next we ordered the chicken tikka sandwich and some chicken pizza. Both of the things were really average. Would not recommend the pizza at all. Not sure if we made the right choices. I am definitely going back for the ambience and Tea ( Love their Masala chai and typhoo collection in particular!) , but not for the food. Also, its quite reasonably priced.",Rated 3.5,83,437,??

The Kangra spring & Nilgiri teas were great but they took an inordinately long time >30 mins in getting to us. Keema samosa was ""again"" out of stock,,,,,,,disappointing. The apple pie cake and fish fry were good. Served with bad tartar first but changed on request. So this is a youth hangout with its own unique buzz unlike the Eponymous kolkata edition which is occupied by a more homogenous age group. The teas are great here and the variety is staggering but the service is poor. I think they have a very competent young crew but they need some space in the ersatz kitchen area....brewing tea is a fine art. This place could morph into something far bigger than it is today. So a shout to management- give it more space both in kitchen & seating and get a larger venue. You can beat the coffee places hands down.

We also ordered a fries bucket which complimented the beverages well, with the right seasoning and the right crispness. The best part, though? The sauce served along with the bucket.

We had to literally shout to grab the attention of the waiter and finally managed a menu card. The place is a 30 feet long corridor with lots of tables and very little space to move between the tables. The overall ambiance of the place is good We ordered for ginger tea and Bun Maska The tea was pretty ordinary and did not match up to the ambience, there was no taste of ginger and it smelled horrible. Bun Maska - they should rename it to ""Bun Bina Maska"" as you can see in the pics I have uploaded there was hardly any butter in it and the bun was not fresh They should try Netaji's chai in from of hanuman temple and understand what is called ginger tea. He serves the tea in an earthen cup and it tastes awesome. For bun Maska the management should taste the bun butter of a small chai shop in front of Chanakya adjacent to Chanakyapuri post office. There is no better bun butter in delhi. 4/5 for ambience 2/5 for the service 2/5 for taste. Very very disappointing and we could not finish the tea. I also gave my feedback to the waiter Mr. Emmanuel, for which he said there is very less ginger in the tea and we should have ordered for masala tea instead and also suggested that masala, cutting and truck driver chai are the best and we should have ordered one of these.",Rated 2.5,48,403,??

I personally loved the lighting and the arched entrances. I must say, choosing one tea from their menu is really tough. Thanks to the hot day, our choices were limited. We ordered a lime and lemon iced tea and a passion fruit iced tea. I absolutely loved the passion fruit iced tea. But the lime and lemon tea had a little too much of the lime concentrate, we had to pour in some extra water to balance it out. We also ordered fish and chips, and keema bun. The fish was super soft and falling apart with a perfect crunchy crumb on it. The keema bun was like a typical roadside one, fried in butter and spicy! An amazing place to visit on any day!

Preeti Kamboj,"Rated Have visited this place several times on weekends when its super crowded! Had to wait for maximum 20 minutes but the food is worth the wait! I will mention in my review the best and the not so good dishes that we have ordered so far. Let's start with something which you must order if you are a non-vegetarian when you visit Cha Bar: Fish and Chips. These are ohh so delicious, crispy pieces of fish served with french fries/potato wedges and tartare dip, they taste heavenly and are capable of making you ignore the trouble you went through while you had to wait to get the table! Next comes Barbecued Chicken Sausages: six small sausages coated in barbecue sauce which are again very delicious and make for a perfect non-veg snack. My third favorite are the range of Desi Burgers they have on the menu. Have tried Bun Tikki and Bun Kebab and both turned out to be perfect. One disappointment on the menu is Spiced Mint Chutney and Cottage Cheese Sandwich. It seems leftovers were used to prepare the sandwich, the cottage cheese was messy, the chutney lacked spices, and the bread slices were very hard. For drinks, have tried Hazelnut Cold Coffee (creamy, smooth cold coffee but lacked hazelnut flavour),Masala Cha (perfect combination of spices added, had 2 cups!!!) and Truck driver 100 mile ka cha (very strong cha but tastes good). The service is decent, food is served within 15-20 minutes and I like the location as well. When I visit them next, would love to try the English tea Sandwiches and some wraps.",Rated 3.5,3,42,??
Gundip Singh Saluja,Rated Coolest cha place ever! Firstly the location- connaught place! It don't get any better. To top it up its in a book store!! Yes literally you can pick up a book from the oxford bookstore and walk into this adjoining bistro to have a lovely read over delicious tea. The selection they have is vast!!

Shalini Vishnoi,"Rated This place is located in the heart of Oxford bookstore. Amidst the hustle bustle of CP this place looks very inviting as it is branded as a Cafe Bookstore. The concept of having a cuppa while reading a book, interesting! Though the cafe looks delightful in concept and ambiance but my experience was far from pleasing. I hit the place with two of my friends around 4 PM. Most of the dishes that we tried ordering were not available. It left me wondering that how they will get through the day. The staff seemed lost and over whelmed by the crowd. Everything other than great looking ambiance seemed messed up. Staff was inattentive, lost and unfriendly. Food : We ordered Mango smoothie, Veg Platter, Pesto Veg Panini Sandwich, Ginger Tea and Lemon Tea. While the Veg Platter and ginger tea was good, others were only bearable. Mango smoothie had a synthetic taste to it whereas sandwich's bread tasted weird. Also, I was served green tea instead of lemon tea and upon questioning the staff I was told that this is how it is prepared and perhaps I should get my taste buds tested! They could have simply apologized for the wrong order instead of covering up so badly. My verdict : The food is below average and the service really needs to pick up, the concept is really interesting. The bookstore is upkept and nicely maintained. It had ladders to reach the books kept at the top, very thoughtful. You can visit the bookstore if not cafe. I am rating this place 2 for the concept.",Rated 2.0,105,640,??

I also like my drink which was Black Currant Smoothie. It was a thick drink with perfectly blended flavor. Moving to the food that we ordered, bun Kebab was filling and good in taste. The Basil Pesto and Panini Sandwich lacked in taste a little. At last, to satisfy our sweet tooth, we ordered Red Velvet but was disappointed.

The tea offerings are exhaustive and very interesting (I was particularly blown by the Kashmiri Kahwah). The cakes are heavenly and I am a fan of the Jalapeo Cheese Poppers. I have only two issues with the place - for one, the place is noisy, which takes away from its intended aim of being a quiet nook where you could sit with a book and a cup of chai. In fact, I doubt that most of its patrons want to have anything to do with the Oxford Bookstore, which the Cha Bar is a part of. Secondly, the servers are oddly expressionless and seem like they've been forced into their job. A smile while serving you would help the exchange, especially if you are being amiable with them! The service can also slow down; I got all my orders 15 to 20 minutes after they were placed.

Went through the menu and ordered mango smoothie, ginger tea, lemon tea, veg platter and panini sandwich. The mango smoothie tasted like a road side synthetic shake. Ginger tea was average. And lemon tea was a fraud. It had no hint of lemon. Upon telling the same to the waiter, he said this is our style. I told him do hell with your fake stuff. A lemon tea with no lemon. Crazy. The sandwich was bad. The bread tasted stale. The veg platter, consisted of some onion rings, samosa and chilli bhajias. These were just fine. The place is cheap.

You'll either see people having coffee over meetings , students in groups or some people who sit alone as they do some work or reading a book maybe. The place gives you a very chilled out vibe. This place has a humongous tea menu. They have all sorts of tea's available. There desserts are nice too with loads of things to offer. I've had the masala cha as well as the cinnamon cha. Both of them were delightful. I've also tried there cappuccino and iced cold coffee. I especially loved the cappuccino. The mint iced tea is also nice. I had the apple cinnamon pie too. It was average. I loved the chicken Caesar salad. Vegetarians can Order without chicken. I'm sure it'll taste good. I've heard a lot about the sandwiches too but unfortunately couldn't try any. Apparently they make it with home made bread. The red velvet cake was just usual but nice. The best part about this place is that it's comparatively very cheap and a place which won't disappoint you.

Anna Menon,"Rated This place use to be AMAZING, but now I've to change my review. A place which had great coffee and tea, excellent fish and chips, pastries, cookies, yummy club sandhwhiches and beautifully baked quiche of the day, has now crumbled, and horribly so. Ordered a chocolate shake and strawberry shake. Both were extremely disappointing. Had gotten lamb rolls, nothing great, just okay. Red velvet cake couldn't even stand on its own and the cream tasted old. Didnt have waffles. Service was pathetic where we had to wait around 15 minutes to get the menu and over half an hour for the food. The entire place has gone down real bad, giving it a 2.5 only for old times sake and in the hope they might go back to being what they originally were.",Rated 2.5,58,265,??
Ishan Dua,"Rated CHA BAR also known as book cafe, famous amongst book readers. Though I'm not a book reader, yet decided to visit this cafe. We ordered FISH AND CHIPS, KEEMA SAMOSA, GREEK LAMB PLATTER, CHICKEN TIKKA PIZZA AND BLACK CURRENT ICE TEA. FISH N CHIPS and KEEMA SAMOSA were worth having on the other hand pizza and greek lamb platter which was mutton Seekh kebab and not lamb was hopeless.",Rated 3.5,35,103,??
Disha Sahasrabudhe,"Rated A great place to have a cup of Tea and rejoice with minimal or no expectations for good service . Adjoining Oxford cafe is a readers delight. Average food, horrible staff, with ""I don't give a shit what your order is""attitude and zombie expressions. Horrible horrible staff! This place can be a big hit if management pays a little attention to their staff and ensure consumer satisfaction. Well, I visited this place with my cousin, we ordered nachos which weren't available, the cold coffee took 20 minutes to arrive but atleast it tasted good. Great concept to combine a tea house with book store, just the service is a major setback. Hoping for better review with upcoming visits.",Rated 3.0,27,53,??
Aditya Agrawal,Rated Well.. Good to go if you want to have some read as it is attached with oxford library.. Noisy resto .. If you looking to have some pleasant place to have tea then this place is not for you.. Menu has countless types of tea but I suggest not to try those.. Better go with simple one.. Go only when you want to have short break and enjoy the tea..,Rated 3.5,10,25,??
Mehak Bhardwaj,"Rated Date of visit 09.09.2015 Cha bar has been on my list of places to visit in CP since this outlet was in statesman house. This time in CP I was fully determined to put a tick on it's name. I've always loved the concept of bookstore cum coffee shop. I think such places are heavenly abode for coffee cum book lovers. Here's my review of this little book store cum coffee shop. Ambience its a lil querky and the tables are made for small group of people,me and my frnds visited in the evening so it was busting with life. The adjoining book store is also very exciting. I could have my coffee and cuddle up to the books all day long! Food The food was affordable and nice,we got one mago smoothie one passion fruit ice tea one pesto sand which and one carrot cake all came in 450/- wat can we ask for more Its a good change as compared to the regular CCD. Service Servers(waiters) are a lil distant. I felt a little more attention was needed on their part. The verdict Ambiance 3.5/5 Food 3.5/5 Service 2.5/5 I enjoyed my food and the bookstore equally. Go try! Enjoy!",Rated 3.5,41,196,??

Alisha Beotra,"Rated A good venue to chill at, provided you get a place to sit. At times, can get your creative juices flowing because of the crowd around and of course, Oxford Bookstore! Food is damn cheap, super affordable and some dishes taste good too. What to try: - White sauce pasta (could be bland at times so it's better to mention you would want it spicy or something, in advance) - fish and chips What not to try: - keema samosa Lemon iced tea tastes good 80% of the times. My standard order ends either with a red velvet which I think they don't serve anymore or a jasmine green tea, both of which are perfect! Could improve on the food. I'm sure nobody would mind even if they increase prices by 10%.",Rated 3.0,57,370,??
Nikhil,Rated The place is located in oxford bookstore.. A must visit place for the book lovers.. You can have any tea here. Everything is special. But when it comes to the food. Its tasteless.

A unique concept where in you can appease your taste buds along with some intellectual offerings. It felt like all the Delhites poured in Cha Bar. I,along with a friend,was pottering around the Book's section for 15 minutes and luckily we got the seating. If I talk about the ambience it would look like a modern tea room.

The food, mainly continental and tea time snacks are prepared in an excellent manner. Although, the chicken sandwich we had, consisted of stale bread which I had to return and the quiche was too soggy to finish, to which the server confessed has been microwaved,weren't too good but overall it was a good spread.

It has a wide variety of teas and other beverages on the menu, along with some good food and bakery desert items. The food and beverages looked delicious and tasted well.

Bariya,"Rated A frequent visitor of the place because of my love for pretty settings with books, cha bar is the perfect place for having myriad types of teas (no surprise for the name suggests the idea) but seriously the first 10 pages of the menu just offer you the varied tea kinds found around India and the world. They've kept the food section to pleasingly minimum and don't offer a lot. Do not have chicken pasta in creamy sauce if your taste buds don't laud Italian flavours. Its gonna come as something a punjabi mom would be disgusted at. However, mix sauce pastas are to be relished. Passion fruit ice tea is refreshing. Smoothies aren't anything special. Greek lamb souvlaki in pita bread is basically seekh kebab roll with haywire spices. Shawarma wrap, that's one good thing. Don't visit if youre looking for peace and quiet. The place is thronged with college goers and people around CP looking for a quick bite. It is pleasant on the pocket.",Rated 4.0,18,24,??
Vrinda Jain,Rated The cafe is reasonable but the service is not at all good. Less rates doesn't mean poor service. The quantity is accordingly less so the rates are ok accordingly.

Good service and it will be my favourite place in Delhi. :),Rated 4.0,1,13,??
Surbhi Gupta,"Rated How cool does this place sound. However it is not that cool. It's a cafe inside a book store. You'll not believe your existence once you see the rates they offer you food at. BUT, the food is not good. The most attractive part of the menu is the different flavours of tea they offer. Hot or cold. I personally did not find a tastable difference in every variety. You can always go there with your favourite novel and order a cup of coffee. But definitely not a place where you can treat your friends.",Rated 2.0,10,74,??

However we ended up ordering cold drinks- I had one of their Iced teas as the mocktail I wanted to try was not available. The place was quite crowded and kind of cramped up with the tables placed really close to each other. So don't pick this place for a date and leave it for hanging out with friends.

Its usually crowded but is a cosy place. Tge interiors are done nicely and has a lively ambience. One can take a look at the books and can good quality time reading one over chai or coffee... Be it a get together with old friends or a day when u want to spend some time with urself.. This is a perfect venue to be at. Its just that, the service needs to be improved a bit since they take really long from giving the menues to serving till billing.

The food is good too. It depends on what you order. Fish and Chips are amazing and Cha Bar serves one of the best cold coffees. I didn't liked Chicken and Creamy Sauce Pasta and the dragon ball tea.

Sinchita Kar,"Rated Type of visit: Personal CHA BAR also known as the BOOK CAFE! It's quite famous among book lovers because it's one of those few places where you can peacefully read and yet have coffee! AMBIENCE: We entered through the Oxford bookstore which lead our way to Cha Bar. It's a small long hallway with white chairs and tables. Surprisingly, even on a Sunday morning, it was almost full. When we entered, there were some empty places but by afternoon, it was housefull. They have a small counter with some bakery items (cakes, brioche) displayed and they have their own coffee machine offering some delectable coffee. FOOD TALKS: We ordered lemon ice tea, mango smoothie and hot chocolate. LEMON ICE TEA: the ice tea was a bit strong for my friend but it was apt and perfect for my palate. I guess, food expresses differently. MANGO SMOOTHIE: it was thick and with strong mango flavour in it. It was perfectly balanced in terms of sweetness. I liked it. HOT CHOCOLATE: the sweetness and the cocoa flavour managed to be in balance with each other, thus not overpowering the tastebuds much. SERVICE: Really slow. I have never seen such a slow service ever and yet this place is jam-packed! I didn't feel much the slow service because I was with friends busy talking. Otherwise, I would have killed myself. Despite it was over crowded, really slow service became a bit difficult to talk, the drinks made an average experience. Still part of my recommendation.

Everything was good and delicious but only one thing that I personally didn't like was the behaviour of the staff. Agreed that you are in the pressure of serving a 100 people may be at a time but if someone is asking for menu or someone is placing an order please pay attention to them first.

When it takes 40 minutes to deliver the order at your table, you can sense something is wrong. Add to that, an uncooked pasta, margherita pizza with two tomatoes crushed over them and ice tea which taste like Rasna or Fruit Kick, then you should know you are definately at the wrong place. The staff was unapologetic about it and said 'We have sold 40 dishes of the same and nobody has complained' and then asks you to pay your dues fast and leave.

Yes the place is really congested Other than this we had a new experience to visit such a place and the food was good that too at really low prices.

Meghna Joshi,"Rated For anyone who wants to know how a place can screw up in multiple ways, half-starve you, have you in danger of going hoarse and deaf, yet still leave you smiling, a visit to Cha Bar is necessary. Walking into Cha Bar started off delightfully. There is something about being surrounded by books which, combined with the promise of food, makes me feel good. The bookstore itself has the regular sections, some unexpectedly good recommendations and plenty of place to sit and read, albeit not the charm of the older stores which had books leaking out of every crevice and a bookkeeper who could find them blindfolded.The minute we go to the cafe itself, however, the noise levels rose alarmingly. Perhaps it was a combination of crowd and bad acoustics, but conversation was made rather difficult for the duration of our visit. Getting a table took some hopping around on our part, but the real wait was for the menus (super elaborate, and fun to browse. They take the whole 'Cha' thing very seriously), the waiter's attention in general (I felt like a neglected child), and the food. It took over half an hour after ordering for anything to reach our table, by which point we'd resorted to shamelessly ogling and pointing at any plates that went past us. It did come, though, eventually, and some things were stellar. Round One consisted of Mint Iced Tea, Chicken Caesar Salad, Greek Lamb Souvlaki and a Chicken Quiche, Basin Pesto Panini. After much flagging down of waiters, the orders for Round Two were taken - Bun Kebab, Flurys Mushroom Puff, a Walnut Maple Cookie, Ginger Cha, and Makaibari. This stuff came relatively faster. Mint Iced Tea: Phenomenal. Well balanced, super minty and refreshing. Also spied a gorgeous red Iced Tea on another table. Must try all. Chicken Quiche: The best thing we had here, and probably one of the better quiches in the area. Fresh, thin pastry, golden on top (though with a crust, which was unusual) and a creamy, flavourful filling. I have a feeling Ill be dreaming of it at least once. Greek Lamb Souvlaki: While the kebab was spicy and pretty nice once I dug it out, an overall letdown due to the extremely dry pita and tiny quantities of tzatziki. Chicken Caesar Salad: Took forever to arrive, around 50 minutes after the order was placed. The (copious amounts of) chicken was soft and juicy, but the lettuce was just sad. Yellow, wilted and not really separated. Basil Pesto Panini: Huge sandwich, but the first bite was puzzling. No pesto in sight! Turns out theyd run out and kind of forgotten to tell us. After waiting for that long, not cool. The server cancelled the order with no fuss, so points for that. Bun Kebab: The bun was nicely toasted and the kebab was superb. The copious amounts of mayo (which was strange on a kebab to begin with. Wheres my green chutney?) kind of drowned everything else out though. We had to scrape loads of it off in order to taste the kebab. Flurys Mushroom Puff: Many things should be taken with a pinch of salt. Or a heap. This is one of them. There was no salt. None. I think it could have been good, with some salt. Walnut Cookie: If anyone can tell me which mithai this reminds them of, Ill be eternally grateful. It wasnt sweet at freaking all, but held extremely well when dipped in chai. A little more sugar and this is a fab chai cookie. Ginger Cha: The holder was awesome, the chai not so much. Neither the ginger nor tea flavours were strong. Makaibari: Smelt divine. A great tea to sip on in general and a particularly perfect way to end the meal. This mountain of food came for around Rs. 800 (and two hours of time). Extreme value for money - the maximum price is around 150, and if you know how to order well youll be done in around 200-300 apiece.

Shubhangi Singh,"Rated I had been looking forward to visit this cute little restaurant.. the reviews I received from my friends and what I had read on zomato added to the excitement to visit this place. When I finally got the chance to go there it turned out to be a total flop show and over hyped. It's a crowded place with all the tables and chairs scrunched up in a tiny area. I was afraid we won't get a table for 4.. However we managed to. The waiter vanished for about 20 mins after giving us the menu. Nobody was coming to take the order! I wondered if there is a self service kinda scene here.. After making us wait for what seemed like hours we somehow managed to grab the attention of a waiter and placed the order. We ordered a roasted vegetables pizza and veg platter. These people DO NOT KNOW how to treat their customers. While I was placing my order, the waiter gave meall the rude and disgusted expressions that he could.. he didn't have the slightest courtesy to talk to us politely.We didn't feel like spending another moment over there. What came next screwed up our mood even more. as if what had happened wasn't enough. Veg platter- 2 extremely tiny pieces of paneer. A pair of mirchi pakora, onion fritters and a Samosa. It would cost you Rs. 120 Very less quantity for that price. Roasted vegetable Pizza- The crust was thinner than a thin crust. It seemed like we were served a chapatti with toppings. This chapatti like thing was for Rs. 170 But it was spicy.. that's the only thing I liked. Food- 3/10 Service- 0/10 Value for money- 1/10 Overall Experience- Never going back again Unwillingly I have to give them a rating of 1.. because there is no option fornegative rating.",Rated 1.0,7,28,??

Chandni Kumar,Rated It's one of the places always on my mind when I am craving for a twist in my evening tea. This place has a very inviting atmosphere but one of the drawbacks here is that this place is always very crowded and noisy. And mostly items listed on the menu are not available. Not a right choice if you are looking out for a peaceful laidback place. Coming to their food - their brownie crisps is my favourite. Guys u really have to try to know what it is. Rest of the food is very average.. very ghar ka khana types. Coming to their selection of teas. Their peach and passion fruit ice tea is a must try. Also you need to try their tea margaritas.. it's heavenly.,Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Christina Peter,"Rated If the staff has the ""I don't give a "", ""I couldn't care less"", etc attitude along with the Zombie expressions, If your food took about 35 mins to reach your table and upon thanking your server, you get the cold shoulder then you might never wanna visit the place again. However Cha Bar (in spite of the F-Yaapaa) is still a part of my recommendations list! Nothing and I say NOTHING beats the classic combination of Books and Tea. Cha Bar added 5stars to this classic combination and then took one back by hiring the staff they did. The menu consists of a million types of teas (it's metaphorical, don't take it literally) and a mix of sandwiches, pizza, rolls, cakes, waffles, fish and chips, etc. The most expensive thing on the menu is about 150bucks. We landed here on a Sunday evening and getting a table is bit of a challenge. We sat and placed our order of Fish and Chips, mango yoghurt smoothie, passion fruit iced tea and paneer and mint sandwich. We were told the order will take 20mins.. it wasn't anything close to 20mins unless they're using a different watch! Fish n Chips- I've had better but never for 100 bucks. The fish was well cooked, the chips were as good as frozen fries can be and the mayo was as good as packaged mayo can be Passion fruit Iced tea- This totally WOWed me. Unlike most iced teas, this wasn't watery and you could actually taste Passion Fruit. Yoghurt Smoothie- Smooth as silk, packed with mango flavor yet not overpowering it..very refreshing Paneer n Mint Sandwich- Huge portion, the bread was soft, fresh and well toasted. The filling was generous, creamy and flavorful. That with a. Side of fries makes a perfect guiltfree meal. Red Velvet cake- I've definitely had better. It wasn't very fresh, kind of dry to be honest but at 70bucks, its emerges as a winner! Overall, an excellent concept and an amazing place, absolutely VFM sadly the service needs to improve in the multiples of thousand. Only if the servers smiled a little!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Jayati Somani,Rated Love the place and the ambience. The milky teas (esp The Truck Driver) are definitely worth a try. I also tried the samosas which were quite passable.

Nikita Chhabra,"Rated I give 2rating just for the concept of a cafe inside a book store. Maybe I visited this place on a bad day, this was my worst experience at any cafe in Delhi till date. I came to this place after reading the great reviews but I'm highly disappointed. The ambience seemed like a college canteen but the interiors of the bookstore and the cafe are kind of 'cool'. So I came here with a friend during lunch hours, we luckily managed to get a seat as it was really crowded even on a week day. We ordered masala tea, passion fruit iced tea and vegetable sandwich along with a brownie crisp cookie. We waited for 45min and still nobody came to serve us. No waiter was ready to listen to us and all of them were quite unfriendly and rude. Finally my friend had to go to the cash counter to call a waiter and we got our order finally after 50mins of waiting. I don't know what's the hype about this place, but I didn't find anything special about anything that I ordered. The masala chai quantity was so less, taste was fine, passion fruit iced tea was good and the sandwich was average.

I ordered tikki burger, panner khurcha(if i spell it right) some panner wrap both were tasty. I ordered for white sause pasta also, which was a FAIL! Beverages were awesome. My love chai, so i ordered cutting cha, cold coffee and hot chocolate.. All were amazing. And, in the end, what made my visit to cha bar 1000 times worth was RED VELVET CAKE.

Masala Tea( Hot ) was extremely good, profound flavors of masala was there. I was sipping Blackcurrant for the first time and it turned out to be a great find. Bun tikki was overflowing with mayonnaise and crust of tikki was crisp. Apart from tea, the second best thing served here is carrot cake. It was served warm with right amount of sweetness. Plus it was aromatic enough to bring water to mouth ... slurrppp.. SERVICE: The number of staff is not proportionate.

It tasted like u put excess bournvita in milk ...... too watery .... most of the times I used to visit this place to have chocolate truffle pastry .... this time they overheated the pastry .. the whole chocolate melted and was spread onto the plate and not on pastry .. they decreased the size of pastry also ..... the staff is too clumsy....

FoodPolice,"Rated Two days ago on the 30th of July 2015, i visitedthis bookstore at connaught place. I really appreciated the book selection and sitting spaces to pre-read some books. However, I regret to say that i did not appreciate at all the behaviour of thestaff in the shop.We pre-selected a few books which we intended to buy. We decided to spend sometime reading before buying these books. As we were reading the books, the shop manager came and satin the readingspace besides us accompaniedwith an employee from the cha bar cafe. This manager was in the middle of firingan employee and we could hear the employee pleading to be pardoned. To worsen the situation, this manager permitted himself to raise the music of the reading space so that we could not hear their conversation. After a long quarrel both of them left with no one lowering the very loud music that was playing. Following this, i asked another staff to lower the music as it was gettingunpleasant to read. Withouttaking my request into consideration this secondperson argued with us unpleasantly saying that it was impossible to lower the music and that the music always played that loud here. This clearly was a lie asi had myself seen the manager raise the music. At this point i ended the discussion, but this person came back to usa few minutes later accusing us of having a chat in thereading space. He then called his manager upon us. At this point,we told them that we were no longer going to buy any books. The two guys then physically bullied us out of the shop. At one point i felt not in the bookshop but in a discotheque (playing loud music) guarded by bouncers.This type of behaviour is clearly not expected from staff in a book library. The staff at the delhi shop clearly do not understand their job role and even less the mentality of delhiites. It would not be less appropriate to saythey have a lot to learnspeciallyhow to address theirclients. It is a shame that such a good book selection is being run buy untrained personnel.I sincerely hope that i can go back to the shop but without asking myself the question whether i would feel secure, at ease and in peace to choose the book i like.",Rated 1.0,1,15,??

Jagriti Sapra,"Rated By far the cutest place I've ever been to , Cha Bar , located in N block , is a relatively small place with limited seating (and it abuts Oxford book store, so you actually confuse that it is a part of the cafe :D ). As per my friend's recommendation , we ordered a red velvet pastry and a blueberry cupcake. We ordered a veg Alfredo pasta and a Bun Tikki burger as well. To start with, The pasta had less sauce (as we're use to a very creamy pasta) but was incredibly tasty , also the Bun Tikki burger has JUST mayo with Tikki but was juicy, less oily and light . To my utter dismay, cupcake wasn't really nice and turned out to be a disappointment but the red velvet is definitely worth trying ( and was delicious as well) . The only let down was the staff : they were unable to communicate well when asked about a dish . We wanted to try a lemon tart, which we were told was unavailable , but turns out it was very much available :/ .

David Sharma,"Rated Cha Bar comes with great decor and some quality food. Locating it is not easy as it is situated in oxford bookstore. Their service is a little bit slow. Talking of the food and beverages we ordered chocolate qcold coffee, English breakfast tea, Fish and chips, Veg Alfredo pasta, Bun Kebab, Smoked chicken and mustard sandwich, platter of chips. Chocolate cold coffee and english breakfast tea was great. Platter of chips, pasta and fish and chips were too good. Cha bar has a great ambience as well.",Rated 3.5,22,50,??
Juhi,"Rated A lot of people mistake this place for a book caf, but it is too crowded and noisy to be termed as a Book Caf. Cha Bar is a famous caf in CP, N block. It is adjoining the Oxford Bookstore. Cha Bar has nice blue and white interiors and right sized tables. One has to be really lucky, to easily find a place here. I went here along with my family one evening and it was jam-packed. We finally managed finding a place, however we had to wait for good 15 minutes before someone took our orders, this was after constantly calling them to come and take the order. Finally, our orders were taken. We ordered their Truck Driver 100 mile ki Chai and Basil Pesto and Vegetable Panini Sandwich. The Truck Driver 100 mile ki Cha wa a Masala Chai with a very fancy presentation. The Sandwich was goodwhich was served with Potato Wedges which were cold. Their staffs needs to be a lot proactive, be it in taking orders or bring the bill or even finding a place for their customers. This place is not very expensive and one can have a good time but with a lot of noise. I would suggest them either to expand or to limit their seating, because the whole caf is so filled with the seating that at times one wont even find a walkway. Overall, I was not very happy because I had a different image of the place.",Rated 3.0,142,378,??
Foodist,"Rated An exclusive place for varieties of tea and short eats. Food is good; so are the beverages. The place gets noisy in peak hours and service becomes slow. It is attached to a bookshop, so readers occupy a few tables.",Rated 4.0,310,190,??
Rishabh Wadhwa,Rated Went to Cha Bar on 18th of July at 7:30 pm. The place is amazing when it comes to work and relax at the same time. It was overflowing with people at that hour leaving no table to sit for about half an hour. Order placed. Celery chicken and iceberg club Chicken Shawarma wrap. Cold coffee. The sandwiches were fine. There was a lot happening in one sandwich which is unlikely. The wraps were in fact good. I was surprised by the blend of perfectly distributed chicken chunks and the veggies. It was really good. And though I did not order the fish and chips this time. But their fish and chips are out of the world for that price You won't get it better than that.,Rated 4.0,21,89,??

Its always almost full and if you are lucky enough, you will get a table easily. Now if we talk about the food, we had ordered Chicken Bun Kabab burger, Chicken shwarma roll and Fish and chips. The burger bun was just awesome, but I did not much like the patty inside it. It was only the patty and mayonnaise, it lacked the standard vegetables required indide the burger. The shwarma roll was awesome. I just loved it! The fish was also very fresh and good. What I hated the most is the waiting time after having the burger. I had to wait for around 20 mins before the shwarma and the fish arrived. I really disliked the service and it broke my appetite. The only reason for my low rating is the service.",Rated 3.0,17,20,??

Yes Cha Bar Cafe, Connaught Place, Delhi is one of its kind where you can indulge yourself in both of these suppa addictive flavours- Book plus Chai.

Indian, Italian, Mediterranean, English, Mexican, French and American delicacies are also available here. So food-lovers with different tastes can have a good experience.

Saiyam Jain,"Rated Its located inside the oxford bookstore, there are very few boards indicating its existence but, i don't think it needs any marketing, its food speaks for itself. More than that is its the environment, the one you look in the movies, grab a book sit and have a sip, and enjoy your own company.. Its that amazing, however the only thing i didn't like about this place is that its small due to which- 1. It is mostly always full. 2. U have to hear all the rumblings and it becomes quite contrary to the environment of a book store. Nevertheless its a must visit place, and the cha samosa's are a must haveS. Go ahead give it a try. ;)",Rated 3.5,12,31,??
Tanyaa Raturi,"Rated I have always wanted to sit here, sip tea and read. Unfortunately, that never happens. The concept is great, the menu is great, but the only problem lies in the fact that most people who come here are not in the least interested in books. You will hear a chattering crowd all around giggling in a bookstore. Coming to the food, there hasn't been a single time I have come here and they say 'not available' to my first two choices. A lot of beverages on the menu (besides the varieties of tea) are usually not available. The service is slow since it is supremely crowded. Sometimes, the waiters listen to your call, and do not pay heed. I am looking forward to sitting here for a cup of tea with a book, only it is not happening! So, well, great place if you want a reasonably priced pretty cafe to sit. But for people like me, not so much. P.S.

Located inside the oxford book store,the cafe is a perfect place for readers to enjoy the serene ambience and at the same time enjoy good food. They have this really good variety of teas and you get all kinds of snacks possible. We ordered for a platter of chips and dip (the dip was basically tomato ketchup and the onion rings were definitely missing, but the fries were good,hot and crunchy) and spaghetti aglio e olio (which was really good! Not too spicy and still full of flavour). The place is always really crowded hence the order takes long to be served. But you forget all of this when you look at the bill.

Well they had around 60+ varieties of tea and they all were craftily named which might confuse you..I ordered black current iced tea, peppermint iced tea, a bun tikki, hummus with pita bread, and their best seller "" fish &chips"". The blackcurrant iced tea was superb but the peppermint iced tea didn't tasted as the name suggests. It tasted more of a litchi drink. The bun tikki was a simple fried good burger with a bit of butter and tikki inside the bun. I have had a better hummus and pita dish earlier,it disappointed me. The fish and chips was fine and was served with a tasty tartar dip!

In food tried the sausages , chicken platter and tikka grilled sandwich. The sausages were the best. Cooked in a typical sauce served with onions and mint chutney were just scrumptious. The non veg platter had sausages again , keema samosa, wings etc. Didn't really like the keema samosa or anything else on the platter. It was average. The tikka grilled sandwich was again average neither good nor bad. The portions were pretty good according to the prices.

We ordered masala chai, cardamom chai, bun maska, chicken wings, fish and fries, assamese tea (I forgot the name of that). Masala chai : Perfect as it needed to be. I was apprehensive that I might be adding sugar as I prefer sweet kind of tea but after having a sip I felt contented. Chicken Wings : Average. A lot of bony affair there but the taste was ok ! Fish & Fries : The fish was soft and it was a delightful experience. The interiors are splendid and the quintessential thing is that it is pocket friendly.We were billed with about 580 Rupees which proved the fact.

The hot chocolate warms you from the inside on a cold winter's day, and the iced teas will cool you down on a hot summer afternoon.

Neha Singh,"Rated I have been visiting this place for years now and its one of my favorite place to chill out alone or with frens :) I really find the concept of opening a cha bar in a book store very very impressive as who doesn't like to sip hot tea/coffee while spending time with their books . The place is always jam.packed and a few minutes waiting can be expected here any time of the day. As soon u enter , colorful Hindi & English syllables lit in light welcomes u which gives u a very heart warming feeling (like a kid has entered a colorful book shop). You will find crowd of every age group here - from youngsters to our grandpa age people ... So this place is for everyone..... feel comfortable and have a good time :) Located in Oxford book store ,N block in Connaught place , cha bar offers more than 100 varieties of tea - desi versions , specialised versions like Assam teas , Darjeeling teas , nilgiris , breakfast , flowering , rainbow, Chinese ,Nepal , Indian herbs, organic , flavored , fusion and even ayurvedic teas . The tea menu is so elaborate that as soon u see it u know they justify their name :) . On my several visits here I have tried their masala cha , cardamom , hindustani , Bollywood masala mix style (my fav bcoz of its presentation), truck drive 100 mile, arabic tea -- all of which are just so perfect to taste with even much much interesting presentation :) . I have even tried their other hot beverages they offer like spiced cappuccino (having cinnamon on top of coffee) which is as good as their teas ; Margaritas like devils paradise and angel's hell which were just so refreshing. Among the various variety of snack food they offer(sandwiches, wraps,nachos, burgers, fries, pastries,patties etc) , I have tried veg panini sandwich, mushroom thyme galleta sandwich - both of them r very good to taste with veg panini a must eat here as per me ; veg snack platter - having desi snacks like samosa , mirchi aloo pyaz pakoraz :D ; bun tikki - too oily ....gives a roadside burger taste (avoid it) . The only negative point here is their super.slow service . This place is a MUST VISIT !!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Shivangi Kohli,"Rated This could be considered an alternate heaven for those who love books. The cha bar is located inside the Oxford bookstore. A perfect day for me would mean spending the day amidst the books and stepping into the cafe for tit bits in between. You're not allowed to take the books into the bar. That makes a lot of sense obviously. The place is always full. It's pretty reasonable too. The service isn't very prompt though. We ordered a second helping of chai which the waiter forgot to note. So we just kept sitting waiting for it, and finally after 25-30 mins we got to know that the order was never placed. Coming to the food. The food is cheap, but it isn't good. We ordered the chicken kathi roll and bun Maska, and tea. I really don't remember what tea we ordered, but we ordered four kinds of it and they were all delicious. So I can say with confidence that their teas are brilliant. The kathi roll, was pathetic. The bun Maska, inedible. The biggest drawback is their food. But it's cheap so we can't really complain. The bun Maska is supposed to be freshly baked bread with jam and butter in between. Here, it was just a bun soaked in something like butter. We actually couldn't eat that. I did see many people gorging on the pasta. I don't know how it was but I guess it would be better than the other stuff on their menu. But for books and beverages, this is the place to go to. So even if I hated the food, I'm going to be hanging out there a whole lot.",Rated 3.0,103,594,??
Megha Malik,"Rated It's been one of my favourite places since it was in the statesman building. They are now situated in the outer circle..and have a slightly different menu but same great feel and flavour. We ordered cold coffees, veg assorted platter(fritters - ok ok) , chilli cheese toast and falafel in pita with hummus. Every thing we tried was awesome! Perfect place to catch with a friend or go alone. They serve nice deserts as well. I have also tried their paneer khurchan roll, red velvet pastry and paneer sandwich in my last visit they were pretty decent. P.S. They are super crowded on a weekend, but don't worry you can either grab a book- since it's a party of a book store or wait in a comfortable waiting lounge. Over all a good place. Easy on pocket.",Rated 4.0,12,37,??
Smit Khurana,"Rated #Economical #Great Beverages #Quiet Ambience. A perfect place to spend time for some serious discussions and unwind with a cuppa. The Book-Store right next to the bar lends a peaceful and uncluttered aura. I just felt the absence of a Charger point around the tables to plug in my laptop / cell phone, quite acutely.

It would have been nice if they had made the seats a little more comfortable n cozy.. In the end ,I would suggest you to go to this place only for the variety of cha they offer!!",Rated 4.5,5,8,??
Abhishek Bhatnagar,Rated A typical tea joint where you can go along with friends to have some munchings and a cup of tea or coffee. You wont get a table very quickly because this place is always filled with people but you can hang around in the oxford book store and find some good reads before you sit for your tea as this place is inside the oxford book store.

The place boasts a mind-boggling variety of tea, with descriptions that only make them more tempting. The service is prompt.

Veg alfredo pasta, Bun kebab, smoked chicken, mustard sandwich, & fish-chips are also some must try from thier eatery list. Pocket friendly budget. Nice place to hangout with friends and throw parties at a reasonable expense.

Prakriti,"Rated Cha Bar, the name itself is a crowd puller. Situated inside the Oxford Bookstore, it is a haven for book lovers. Scan through volumes while satiating your tastebuds. For me, the place combines two of my love interests-books and tea/coffee. As the name suggests, Cha Bar has a huge collection of teas to choose from. Bubble teas, fruit teas, Darjeeling tea, Masala Tea, they have it all. Also, they serve coffees and other such drinks. Order anything and rest assured that it will be served well. They have glass tea cups, and designer kettles which are bound to make it a memorable experience for you. The place offers light snacks, finger foods; the perfect accompaniments for your beverage. A must try is their fish and chips. The dip served with it is absolutely delicious. The fish is fried till it turns light golden brown. You can also enjoy your tea/coffee with a humble plate of wedges, fries, smileys, etc. The food is not v.impressive but good enough for a light snack. The only bad thing here is service. Only after 10 mins will you have a waiter at your table, that too after asking them 2-3 times. Cha Bar could have be a superhit place had it not been for the bad service and an unimpressive food menu.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

You can occupy one of the tables, read all day long & keep trying their snacks and variety of 'chai'. You won't get bored. Because of the space arrangements and table layout, this place is best suited for an outing of 2-4 people. I like this place precisely because of this reason. Their light, soft music is good.

This time we ordered spiced cappuchino with sprinkled cinnamon powder (Divine it was and really divine)...next was mango smothie and I must say one of the best which I ever had...

While we were searching for books at Oxford, within ten minutes a staff person from Cha Bar showed up and led us to our seat. It was a surprising and nice gesture to see the staff being concerned about their customers. The ambience was like always lovely. I like the fact that the windows are placed at a certain height so first, they are good for light ventilation,and second, they provide a view which is devoid of any traffic. Then the food. We ordered a Pasta Arraibita, Vegetarian Snack Platter and Strawberry Iced Tea. The Pasta Arraibita was spicy and fresh while the Vegetarian Snack Platter had a lot of variety. It would be the perfect snack for a rainy get together. The Strawberry Iced Tea was a refreshing surprise from the drinks I have been having for some time now. Vrinda Chhabra",Rated 4.0,16,114,??

HR,"Rated My first cisit to Cha Bar can be best described by the surprising... because I didn't know that Cha Bar was ""in"" Oxford Bookstore. This combination of a bookstore with a coffee shop is rare in NCR atleast, so Cha bar has a rare combination available. The ambiance is bright and energetic, with all tables occupied on an average day. Like any cafe, Cha bar serves light eats and a wide range of coffee and tea... Strong recommendation for their Masala Chai, South India Coorg Coffee and Spiced Capacinno along with Falafel and Hummus in Pita pockets and Sandwiches The only problem is the noise level, probably due to the acoustics of the place, which makes it difficult to have a peaceful conversation. Also, getting the attention of the servers is difficult task.

The platter of fries and wedges was as expected good. Everything on the platter was crisp and good. What I didn't like, though is that the staff isn't well trained at all. They just don't communicate well. At the end of our meal, as we were about to get up, one of the staff members actually told us to get up because he had another customer waiting for that specific table whilst another table was free. Also don't get why they don't accept debit cards for payments. Running a restaurant in C.P, think that should be a pre requisite.

My personal fav are the masala chai, earl grey and flavored jasmine, lemon, ginger. Most of their sandwiches are quite good. They have less oil so quite healthy too. Nothing great about the coffees and lattes. Getting place here sometimes could a difficult thing. It does get noisy at times, due the chatter of the crowd.

Khimpi Dutta,"Rated Finally yesterday evening, after much recommendations from my reader friends I went to Cha Bar (Actually, my main motive was the oxford store. And Cha Bar was an added advantage) As expected entire cafe was full. We had to wait for 20 minutes to get us a seat. Menu seemed very tempting. We ordered one mint ice tea and two cold coffees with icecream. When the drinks arrived. Ice tea was no minty. It was just plain ice tea. And there was no icecream in our coffees and coffee was very watery. When we asked the waiter he said icecream got melted. Yeah right, like we never had cold coffees with icecream before. Disappointing it was. Then my friend ordered waffles, only to know that no waffles was available. Then she changed it to pasta. Pasta too was not available. Then she asked for tiramisu pastry, it was not there either. Finally she asked for whatever pastry they have in the counter. The waiter brought a chocolate truffle pastry, which was bad. Very bad. She couldn't finish half of it. Our veg and non veg English sandwiches sucked too. Bread was too hard. And not at all tasty! With non availability of item, nonchalance serving stuff, tasteless food, and god damn loud music this place is a big NO if you are looking for having a quality time with friends. After this very bad experience, me and my friends parked ourselves at the book store. Oxford experience did make up for Cha Bar.",Rated 1.5,12,61,??

Although never and i mean never order any of their ice teas . They are really teally bad . I still can't get that taste out of my mouth . We had ordered three ice teas : lemon , mint and blackcurrant . I am sorry i can't get you any feedback on the cha coz i am not really a chai person . But i have heard it's kinda okayish .

Akhilesh Anand,"Rated I had reviewed Cha Bar previously quite a while back, but yesterday after another visit, I felt like reviewing this beautiful place again. Usually the reason for Cha Bar is when you're hungry and there is delicious food served besides the bookstore you're reading at. But yesterday I genuinely went to Cha Bar and it was still up at the expectations. Grilled Sandwiches is the best thing I had at Cha Bar. The best part is the ambience, people who love books, are obviously crazy fans of Cha Bar but even for non readers, the whole place has a charm to it. The most friendly staff who for some reason never stop smiling :p",Rated 5.0,75,93,??
Poorvi Singh Chaudhary,"Rated On Wednesday me and a couple of my friends missed our college and went to cha bar which is located in Connaught place N block. Whether one prefers a rich, full-bodied, strong flavor, or a light fragrant taste, the Cha Bar offers a wide and enviable choice. There is indeed nothing quite like a good cup of tea so every cup of blend that is served has journeyed, be it from the dhabas in India or from around the Globe. Cha Bar Menu is refreshed regularly with additional varieties of exotic Teas and scrumptious snacks. Even though it was midweek the caf was crowded and we had to wait around 10 minutes to get our table which was okay, no big deal. Once we were seated, we looked at the rather extensive menu. There was more than 100 varieties of chai and huge variety of desserts to fill your tummy and to please your craving for sweet. We ended up ordering masala chai, cappuccino, cold coffee with ice-cream, chocolate flavored cold coffee plus Alfredo pasta. Only the tea was worth having and the pasta was edible may be because I was starving, but the rest of the things we ordered was way below the standard that we expected from this place. (Although I got my coffee changed and it was better than before). One more thing about this place is that you cannot order food from the kids sections, you have to be a kid to have it (I wanted pancakes !!!). I found the service provided by this place good, the staff was friendly and they were more than happy to change my coffee. In addition to this place being cheap and pocket friendly without compromising the quality of food (I guess this time I had a bad luck), This place is heaven for Kitabi kidda to spend the entire day. Good books plus nice chai one cannot ask for more although you cannot enjoy at the same time Follow me on instagram flavor of my life",Rated 4.0,27,34,??

It's a great place to go with your parents, friends or your girlfriends and one of those places where i can assure you that everyone will love the place. The cakes and cookies are also great and the things i love the most is their cutlery ..I love it to the core.

We ordered food and it came almost after half an hour. We ordered cold coffee with ice cream and it was tasteless. When i asked if we could get extra sugar, the waiter made a face and took the glasses, as he came back, he literally slammed the glasses on the table. The staff was pretty rude. Coming to the food, the kathi roll had enough oil to to be used by a cow for a massage. The pasta had no flavour and it was pretty much raw. Such a bad experience. And as soon as we finished, the waiter got the bill. Which is quite weird because they took almost 45 minutes to get our food but one minute to get the bill.

We ordered white sauce pasta which wasn't very great, but the red velvet and flourless chocolate cake were amazing beyond words.

Must visit at least once, that is all I can say. The bill is attached as proof of what I tried, Kindly check. 4.0 because : 1. Ambiance : Full of natural light, today the ""Mausam was Awesome"" anyway that added even more magical touch. 2. Food Quality and Price is Great : I am at loss to understand how they are able to manage them in such harmony. Cheap but hygienic + looks good + tastes good = Orgasmic experience. 3. Locations : On Second floor so it could be tad tough for elderly and senior citizen's but worth taking the pain. 4. Seating could be an issue on weekend's as people would be waiting in there. 5. Mild douchery detected, please beware. 6. Server are nice people, will take care of you. One more thing, not all the charging outlet's are working so please make an informed decision accordingly.

Shubham Agrawal,"Rated A light on the pocket cafe tucked away inside the Oxford bookstore opposite Statesman House, making it rather tough to discover by yourself .... which is just as well as this place would probably be jam packed all the time if it was anymore conspicuous. The pricing of items here is unbelievably low compared to what you'd expect from a cafe in cp. The cafe serves an insane variety of teas making it a must visit for tea aficionados. The smoothies and milkshakes are delightful , ice teas are above average. Margaritas and iced tea crusher weren't available when we visited. The food is decent considering what you pay. The sandwich portion sizes are pretty good though the veg sandwiches leave something to be desired . Non veg sandwiches are above average. Their Fish and chips are also pretty decent. rating: Ambience:4/5 (Anything in the vicinity of books gets browny points from me :p Not being able to carry books in though is a minus . tables are pretty clustered and don't expect comfy sofas to lounge on. ) Drinks: 4/5 service: 3.5/5 (prompt service on a weekday afternoon)",Rated 4.0,11,44,??

Ordered a club sandwich and a Caesar's Salad. Both came in decent portions and were well done. The desserts were also pretty good. The Tiramisu especially was excellent.

Asha Jose,"Rated For someone who thought that Cha Bar would serve to be the best place for a book lover to hole up, for some quiet reading, with your favourite book and some light food -- I was in for a disappointment of epic proportions. I'll be honest when I say that I'm a little confused on how to review this place, because my experience here, as a book lover has been thoroughly disappointing, however, as an everyday Joe who doesn't really concern himself with the Oxford Bookstore on the side, my experience was quite nice. So I will split the review for both kinds of people. For the 1 st kind -- The Book Lover -- I was surprised to know that they don't really allow you to carry your own books upstairs. I mean, I thought the whole point of having a cafe next to a bookstore, was to sit comfortably and enjoy your book along with some knick knacks. But hey! I can understand the management's concern at this point, because if everyone were to do that, the Bookstore sales would plummet. But imagine my shock, when one of my friends, who purchased a book from Oxford Bookstore and wanted to read it in Cha Bar, while waiting for me, was rudely told by the cafe staff that she can't leisurely read books in here!! Whaattt!! So yeah, Cha Bar is, in every sense of the word, Anti- Books!! Strange. Now for the 2nd kind -- Everyday Joe who is blind to the Bookstore -- You might actually like this place, coz the teas are quite tasty, food is above average, and prices are pocket friendly. The place has a young, charming vibe to it. And of course, you can pretend to be a book lover, when you haven't touched one in your entire life. Its perfect for you... There you go, pick a side...",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The ambience is great, although the place might seem a bit overcrowded. I didn't try any of the teas (cha, to be precise) pertaining to the blazing hot weather outside. I did try the cold coffee, which was average, and ordered the chilli cheese toasties, which looked better than they tasted. But I reckon that rating this place for the food wouldn't be too fair. It is more about the experience rather than the food. Hence the 4 stars.",Rated 4.0,11,42,??
Dhruti Choudhury,"Rated I had a rather tasteful Tibetan gojiberry chai. The taste had a mild salty appeal, overall when the tea floors on your palette, it gives a soothing effect.

GurPreet Kaur,"Rated It's been ages I've been visiting Cha Bar. It use to be one of my favorite place for hangout. A simple and cozy atmosphere of the place that was there when it was in Statesman Building has been replaced by noisy atmosphere. Ambience: They try out new things after every few months or on some festival. The use of colorful lights enhances the vibrancy of the place. Now they have made it more congested. Service: Earlier, the seats were less and service staff was more. Now, seats are more and serving staff is less. Phew! So yesterday the place was almost full with no vacant seat and there were only two guys that were serving. As a result of which the service was very slow. It's a high time for them to higher new staff. Food: So far they have maintained the quality of food. But they don't serve half of the things in the menu.

The service is bad, cold and rude. If you need a glass of water, you might need to ""remind, and shout"" at the waiter atleast 5times to get it!! PS. The airconditioning is switched off after 5pm.

Jabberwock,"Rated I loved the old Oxford bookstore inside Statesman Building and the Cha Bar there was great, too. Sadly, both bookstore and the eatery have lost their charm and quality ever since they shifted to across the street. Although almost all items on the menu are sort of pocket friendly, they usually do taste well at all. I had the blueberry muffin once and there was not a single berry piece in sight and the sponge cake wasn't spongy either. The red velvet cake was really sub par too as it felt stale and was too overloaded with cream cheese than is permissible. The teas and coffees aren't impressive either. For example, my lemon and lime zest iced tea was neither lemony nor zesty nor cold but tasted too much like ginger tea. Their coffees are usually weak, too, and I know of very few people who prefer it that way. Plus, for a cafe situated inside a bookstore, you are not allowed to take your books in here to browse as you snack or sip on a beverage, unlike how it was in the older store. Finally, the service is extremely slow and often incompetent to deal with the large crowd that tends to congregate here after lunch hours. The menu reaches your table at a painfully slow pace and the food takes even longer. The staff are usually unresponsive the first couple of times you hail them and this tends to put one's mood off even before a meal/drink is made available for consumption. If you ain't too picky, it is not a completely bad option for those already in CP and who're looking for a cheat meal deal, but definitely not something to exclusively travel for.",Rated 2.5,34,268,??

Madhur Agarwal,"Rated Went to cha bar today with my friend after listening and reading a lot about it. About ambience, its nyc simple sober but too many people n tables gives a claustrophobic feeling. Due to noise, we had to talk in relatively higher tone of volume. About food, the menu is pretty extensive. We ordered a ceylon tea , a cold coffee, a basil pesto sandwich and a veg snack platter. The cold coffee was 2.0/5.0, ceylon tea was a first for me so no remarks but it was simply boiled water with tea leaves, sandwich was ok ok so i'd rate it as 3.0/5.0 but platter was a disappointment... 1/5... Service was not so great. Waiters didn't had any knowledge about the menu and specialities of the restaurant. So overall, I might not go to cha bar again just to have a nice peaceful time.

It's a little congested because it's a tiny corner of Oxford book store, and it's always always mostly crowded. Can't blame them, the food is so good and at affordable prices that it's hard to resist. So we ordered a strawberry shake, lemon iced tea, organic tea, camomile and honey tea and a cutting chai. ALL of them were exquisite. Esp the camomile and honey tea. It was so refreshing and different. Then for food we ordered paneer tikka wrap, murgh malai tikka sandwich, cheese toasties and bun maska. The portion of sandwiches was huge. It was tasty as well. Wrap and toasties were also equally good. It was bun maska which was a joke! It was just a tiny slice of bun and butter. Nevertheless, I love buns! Then we also ordered multigrain granola cookie and English nutty cake. Both were yum.

The menu is full of large variety of tea and coffee....cakes pastries wraps sandwiches...pasta....Red velvet cake was simply the standout of dishes we ordered...the apple pie and pasta vegetable alphredo were just fine..The chatpata aloo wrap was the worst...dont ever try it...the place is gud for someone who wants to read book while having a sio of coffe or tea....but for food lovers looking for a mouth watering and tongue melting place...its a total let down...But i would suggest do try RED VELVET CAKE.....its absolutely awesome....,Rated 2.0,19,116,??
Rajat Handa,"Rated Cha bar, or Chai bar, is a small cafe located inside oxford book store. Initially, the plan was for people to come to oxford, have a look at the books, buy them and sit inside this cafe and read them. Nowadays,cha bar operates at full frequency whereas only those in waiting look around the bookstore. If you're in CP(on a tight budget) and have lots of time to kill, Cha bar is the place to go. They have over 100 variants of tea as well as various hors d'oeuvre. Their passion fruit iced tea, hakuna matata coffee and chocolate truffle pastry are a must try. The only niggle one experineces is the non-availabilty of a table. That is because of the small size of the place , limited number of staff and also because people generally sit and talk for hours over a cup of coffee. The place is jam-packed during evening especially on weekends. So, don't be annoyed if you aren't able to find a seat during your first visit. Once you've been here, you'll be coming again and again.",Rated 4.0,38,166,??
Iti Bhargava,"Rated Cha bar sounds like a lovely place to browse books and catch up with friends, but be warned, the service of this place is rather surprising! I visited this well designed place with a few friends the other and my experience of the place wasn't up to the mark. We ordered for some fish and chips and the usual iced teas! They took a while to serve the order, and when I asked for a lemon with the fish, the waiter stared at me in shock as if I'd asked for his kidney! Funny thing was, I never got that piece of lemon that the fish deserved. The bill took fairly long to arrive too! Overall, the ambience was loud and not very welcoming! Nevertheless, the food and drinks were well done and the book store was a saving grace! Maybe it was an odd day, but please, smile at your guests, or at least try!",Rated 2.5,5,161,??

Joel George,"Rated Cha Bar was always one of those places I saw from a distance and then mentally said ""Pass"". I had no idea what to expect and neither did I have any strong reason to try it out. That was true until my beloved decided I absolutely had to, after she was blown away by it. And so we went. But this was one of those rare occasions when I would end up kinda ruining a place for her, not just because my opinion was different from hers, but because I just didn't get what all the fuss was about! After my experience, I thought about it, and then I read what some of my fellow reviewers had to say, and I'm glad to report I've figured it out. Cha Bar is smartly located inside the Oxford Bookstore, not outside, not thru - inside. But this is a bookstore, not a library. So obviously, you cannot take a book to the cafe side unless you buy it. Whats weird is that you cannot take your own book in either. Hmm.. Now, the image and the very concept of a place where you can relax and have a good read over a cup of tea (or anything else) is not new. But being surrounded by books, set in such a wonderful place, makes you feel really really happy the moment you step in. And most people who would come in here are book lovers. So if you're like me, you're already in love with the place. And here's the is the illusion I'd like to pop. Why? Because this is an opinion on the cafe, not the bookstore. The bookstore is amazing, no questions, and it makes you feel like a kid exploring every aisle, lined with fascinating trinkets. But the cafe is not - not quite as much. So lets focus on the cafe then. The cafe is not, in my opinion, well suited to reading at all. The decor is nice enough but the furniture is not comfy enough for ""lounging"" around either. Since the place is not too well spaced out, the crowds and the chatter can also be a negative in this regard. The background music somehow doesn't seem to help. So that clears up my take on the place's image & its association with books. Why's this important? Because, the moment we separate this place from that image, we can now compare it to any barista/ccd/costa coffee/starbucks/chai point type place. Which I think is fair. Don't get me wrong, I do not think this place is trash. I do however believe its image and association tends to give it an unfair blur-advantage due to its location. Now, as a cafe, ChaBar is a nice bright vibrant setup which screams youth. But its more a place to hang out or grab a quick chai and sandwich in the evening rather than hanging out for extended time. The service is not too shabby in my experience, but the food ranges from ordinary to good. They're called Cha Bar, and the menu is 70 % tea, which is great. We tried the coffee for a change and that was very good too. We also tried the Caesar Salad among other stuff, and it was OK. The veg platter was again OK. The desserts do not seem to be inviting at all, and as has been reported by many is sourced from Park in CP. The menu does have stuff other than tea, so if its on the menu, then they're responsible for all of it. The quality of the food is about a 3/5 on average. The drinks on the other hand are 4.5/5. There is no WiFi. Everything else can be summed up again as a 3/5. And thats the math behind the above rating. So in short - go to the oxford bookstore if you love books and when you're there and you want tea/coffee, go to the cafe and get your fix. If you're lucky, you may get a seat soon, and if you're made of magic and sugar crystals, you may even get a quiet surrounding. However, if you plan to have anything more than their great selection of tea or even coffee, you're being bold. And you're probably expecting too much. Especially since this is after all CP and after that great tea, if it is stuff to eat that you desire, there's loadsa options once you step out... Now that I think of it, if the ChaBar menu married the CCD Lounge/Starbucks Decor and WiFi, that would be a 5* destination... :)",Rated 3.5,59,439,??

It was fully occupied even though it was middle of the week. We started with Raspberry, Lime n lemon zest and Mixed fruit iced teas. The raspberry & lemon one was good but the mixed fruit did not have any essence of tea. And order the veg snack platter which had 1 samosa, aloo pyaz pakora, paneer pakora and fried chilli. It was good. Then we ordered chilli cheese toasties which were really tasty and paneer khurchan roll which I did not taste so can't judge. The star was the Bollywood masala chai in the cute kettle.

Shubhda Chaudhary,"Rated Quite honestly, the previous location for Oxford Bookstore was better. No matter, how cool, innovative and architecturally designed this one is, its a little too cluttered. As if, a lot of things-books, people, chairs,food, waiters, etc are being packed in. As soon as I entered, the yellow cycle with flowers, touched my heart. In the inside, you would see little notes, elegantly decorated with wires, hanging as if on a tree. Do take pics. You can even have fish and chips here, something I had after 3 years. Ah! The orders are delivered quickly. Taste the various tea varieties here. I love how Cutting Chai was delivered in a little money-metal casket. The only negative is, you cant take a book from Oxford Book store and read in Cha Bar. You need to buy. If that's the case, they should allow you to take your own book, which again they dont.

The in house library The excellent location(plus the easy in the pocket vibe in a place like CP) plus a vibrant ambiance An extensive menu It's almost a dream come true for students/tea lovers/book worms/casual date I say ALMOST with a heavy heart. The lopsided seating arrangement makes the waiting time longer than it ideally should. The waiting seats in the back are more comfortable than the seats in the cafe. Extensive Menu - Yes. But, eye catchy? No They should focus on Menu designing Coz we ended up ordering from 'other drinks' and nay, it was not a personal choice but just more simpler. They don't focus much on customer engagement coz they have enough of them clearly.! I'm NOT returning after my less than fantastic treatment to their version of smoothies which they alleged was made with fresh fruits but in actual a lot of water and syrup. Chaach.

Karan Kumar (@karansayz )( Www.facebook.com/karansayz)(Famed Karanz Review)( Delhi/NCR Top Reviewer),Rated My view I think the place is over hyped and my views are as follows . You start as a cha bar and then you serve desserts as well. This is good in terms of a brand extension but then the quality also needs to be maintained since people would order them as well. AmbienceWe tried the red velvet. Having eaten almost all the good ones in around Delhi / NCR you could make out where does it stand . It wasnt wow and was actually cold hence not soft and sad. They have spoons for serving and my friend wanted to try an apple and Cinnamon Pie which was also dry and a bit hard. They were earlier at the Statesman House and now are at the Outer Circle. Also another change that has happened if it has become noisy . Everyone is talking and at a high pitch .

Cha Bar, located adjacent to the Oxford Bookstore is a great place for tea and coffee as well as quick bites. The ambience of this cafe is very different and cute, yes cute!! Book lovers, coffee lovers and chai lovers throng this cafe at all times. The first time I visited this place with a friend, we ordered - Spiced Cappuccino , Cafe' au Lait , Flourless chocolate cake and Lemon tart. The size of the tart was surprisingly huge and the flourless cake was really blissful. The coffee were great. In my subsequent visits, I have tried- Khatakali Chai, Hakuna Matata coffee(Kenyan), Lavender tea, Fries , Platter of chips with dip, Blueberry muffin. I would say that the food and drinks served in Cha Bar are great on taste buds and light on pockets. The service is also good.

Here's the other side of the story though : Over rated! Well, I say this for the desserts, atleast.I've visited the cafe a few times but I've never gotten the opportunity to grab a bite for whatever reasons. But today was the disappointing day that I did. After having a great meal, I confidently brought my friend here, absolutely sure that we'll have a great ending to our day. 1. Red Velvet Pastry - 1/5 Immediately by its look, you will realize it isn't authentic. That would have been fine if atleast the pastry tasted good itself. Absolutely DRY! And tasting really odd - definitely stale, resembling nothing close to a red velvet by any means. 2. Apple and Cinnamon Pie - 2/5 Well atleast this was warm like pies should be. But the second my fork (yes, not a spoon, we were eating with the given forks) hit the pie, it crumbled into a dozens of pieces - base, apple, raisins and top crust all separating!!! This is the first time I've seen a pie this DRY. This amounted to Rs. 191. ABSOLUTE RIP OFF. We ate about only half of this disaster because it was so unappetizing, and were running too late to get into a fight, so we paid the bill, quickly let the staff know that we've had a horrible experience, and walked out - almost sure we won't be returning to experiment again.

Simran Dhaliwal,"Rated From Statesman House to now in Outer Circle, Connaught Place.... things have changed. And the charm of this place has multiplied. I would be biased if I say I preferred the old days of statesman house but then that would be for some old memories. The new contemporary avtaar has lots to offer and ponder upon. The design of this place pushes you to think. It transforms you to a different place. The people around makes you feel as if you aren't in a cafe in delhi rather some place else. Having said that, this isn't a quiet library anymore. People have forgotten to whisper and talk softly. You can now hear people chatting non-stop. The food menu is good. Offers variety at a very decent price point. Both for beverages and snacks. We ordered a shami kebab sandwich with ginger tea and truck driver tea. The food was just about okay. Good enough to go back but it won't be the center of your discussion. The service is bad. To the point that the girl serving me refused to acknowledge if she has heard me and then rudely asked me to wait. May be bcoz 3 people were managing a packed floor.Oh, did I say, I miss cha bar @statesman house? we waited for long for this outlet to reopen. Do keep a check on service.

Normally a so called 'Book Cafe' should have a quiet ambiance for people to enjoy food while reading, cha bar isn't exactly peaceful but it's worth it, I keep coming back here for more. With so many visits here , I have almost exhausted their menu. It's service is decent with plenty of servers giving attention even on the busiest days. The food is remarkable , We ordered Fish and Chips , Cold coffee with ice cream , Bun kebab and Chicken and Jalepeno Sandwich. The chilled cold coffee arrived first which was so needed to beat the heat outside. The ice cream was inadequate but the coffee was relished even then. The sandwiches are amazing here , after so many visits i have made some of them my favorites like chicken and jalapeno. Crisp brown bread laced with mayo , mint chutney and huge pieces of tender chicken and topped with tangy Jalapenos. Among other sandwiches the Celery Chicken and Iceberg club for those tho prefer their sandwiches to be a non fiery. Bun Kebab was also amazing , soft bun with succulent crushed patty with mayo dressing. Fish and Chips are worth mentioning , At this price point you wont find better fish anywhere.

Another must try is the whole range of flavoured lattes. I am not much of a cappuccino person so lattes work best for me. Plus a basic fish and chips platter is heavenly.

Abha,"Rated A paradise for book lovers... Amazing concept! With their in house library, not only is the place good for a ME time but also a nice place to hangout with friends.. ! The variety of teas confuses you on what to order! Oh and also, their tea cakes and muffins are to die for... Super fresh and amazingly yummy! Its a very reasonably priced cafe with good food and amazing beverages.. The only problem? When it gets too crowded, their servers seem a tad bit confused and the orders take a little too much time for one's comfort to get ready... The servers, otherwise are friendly and pleasant... Soon going to visit for a ME time!! ^_^",Rated 3.5,17,9,??
Ritwij Goswami,"Rated A book and a cup of coffee. A match made in heaven. That is precisely what this place provides. Incorporated with Oxford Bookstore, one can go there alone, browse through the vast collection of books across all domains and sit there for hours reading and sipping on coffee or one can go there with a bunch of people and sit and chill over a wide range of tea, coffee and snacks complimented by a lovely ambience. And the best part, you get it for a song. Totally budget friendly.",Rated 4.0,2,82,??
Debdatta Paul,"Rated The interior is just mind blowing! We ordered chocolate ice coffee, khus sherbet and blackcurrant ice tea. Khus one was okay but the other two were good!

Erick Massey,Rated Went to this place in search of good tea which was a disappointment eventually. 'Cha bar' sounds like a place where you have this 'adda culture' with some more options.

Fish and chips and a few snacks are okay but overpriced conaidering the place.,Rated 3.5,68,98,??

Sneha Sharma,"Rated The place is really packed but this only speaks about its popularity. Try the Truck driver tea, which is strong and perfectly spiced is great to refresh yourself. Masala and bollywood have strong dominance of certain spices, hence i would prefer a more balanced tea- truck driver. Now for the food, try the bun maska- it's simply out of the world. It's better than any bun maska i have tried, even in Bombay. Chilli cheese toast and brownie cookie are good too wd tea.",Rated 3.0,3,0,??

As the name suggest they have elaborated menu for tea and coffee. We ordered Masala Tea and English Breakfast Tea, both were fantastic. When it comes to food it was not so great, Chicken Shawrma wrap was good but masala aloo wrap didn't have enough filling and veg cucumber and cheese sandwich had no cheese.

The food, the books you immediately fall in love with the place. The cafe and the bookstore are very quiet and calm helping you to relax. The menu houses wide varieties of teas, salads, sandwiches, and other sides. There is a mouth watering range of desserts. So we ordered a salad and a sandwich along with ice teas. The pita sandwich was great and the salad was also top notch. I have had better lemon ice teas but the raspberry one was great. Moving on the desserts we ordered brownie cookie and some muffins. The muffins were nice and tasty but the brownie cookie made my heart melt. Its a must try.

So u reach there and u find yourself inside a hall full of books, certainly coz it's a bookstore and also a mix of library feel.... There is a proper place at the end where u can sit n read a book for hrs.... So for the concept I'd rate it pretty high.... Now next to one hall there is this vertical hall which u call the cafe or cha bar.... The menu variety is fast food types... U get sandwiches, shakes, pasta (not always available), smoothies, coffee and tea of course.... We ordered a sandwich and chilly toast where were decent and the English tea cake was amazing !!! The cold coffee is pretty ok, nothing awesome abt it.... The ambiance is studious n youthful..... People sitting with their tea over notes n discussing is like gng back to college altogether....

Altamash Aslam,Rated The place is really nice. I specially fell in love with the interiors and their typical modifications of the normal cutlery used for serving tea. The menu us huge and you can get any type of tea from all over the world. The taste of the tea we ordered was nothing out of the blue but I liked the cutlery they used. The chicken wrap was hopeless with hardly 2 pieces of chicken and oil dripping all over. The staff was rude. The waiting line was a little long. The books store is really well designed and you can find all kinds of books here. The only thing that turned me off was their service. We ordered a piece of cake and after 10 mins we were told it was out of stock. Then we ordered another cake and the waitress forgot to give us our orders. After 15 minutes they served a slice and that too it was not the one we ordered. The waitress was hiding somewhere and other waiters were attending us and had no sense of shame on being late or serving the wrong things. I would suggest this place a must visit for people who love reading and for others to have a sense of the amazing interiors.

Still this is a place to be if you are tired after roaming in the inner circle for long and you a need a refreshing cup of tea with a mix of Indian and contemporary European snacks...

But i won't encourage the interiors of the cafe because it becomes a bit suffocating at times maybe due to the over seating arrangements. this place has obviously a vast variety of teas! more like a tea hub! for the vegetarians: spiced mint chutney and cottage cheese & hummus pita sandwich are good to go! with their immense beverage menu. a cafe like this is good for the people to have "" peace of mind"" which is really imp. in today's rash environment.

It's a long alley, with chairs and tables parked left right and centre (like literally). The place is chirping with enthusiastic couples, daily office people, stepping out of their monotonous routine, while they grab a magzine from the book store next door while waiting for a cup of coffee! Cha-sha, a common lingo amongst the punjabis, refers to a tea break, and well this place lives upto the literal interpretation! The service is quick, sweet and gentle!

We mentioned that the table us full of food and it was an accident but we pain the extra money with the bill anyway. Moreover, we didn't get any bill for the extra money we paid. Ps: NO restaurant charge their customers for broken crockery EVER but apparently cha bar does !!!

It is quite crowded and more often than not you will experience unavailability of items from the menu. Nevertheless, people who love books and tea must visit!",Rated 3.5,22,55,??

It was my first time here, and there was a time (when I was in the middle of all books) I wanted to jump-in-joy like a small child (Note: I am not those typical book lover kind of person, I still wanted to do that, so just imagine how cool is this place is!) I ordered two teas : Bollywood masala mix cha and Truck driver 100 mile cha. The first one was good, even the second one was good only if you are suffering from cold (as it clears our throat because there is too much pepper in that :P ). I even ordered a red pasta (after reading a review on Zomato that it's very spicy and I have a thing for spicy food), but they initially got me a white pasta and then they brought a red pasta instead(after realizing their mistake), but I have a feeling that they have mixed the red sauce in that white pasta which they initially brought because of which I almost hated it. But I would like to believe that other food items are good, because I so want to go there again!!",Rated 3.0,5,159,??
Rishabh Pandey,"Rated Ok, let me start by saying that Cha bar is cool. Its cool enuf for me to visit there everytime i am in CP. The food is good(for the most part) but the biggest issue i have with this cafe is the spacing. Waiting for several minutes just to get seated is not something that i like esp when i am with a big group(all those stupid people saying ""excuse me! Excuse me!""

Ambience : 3/5 The ambience here is average and too loud. Actually it felt like a BAR, but with people drunk on TEA. :P Staff : 3/5 The service is slow. I also have noticed that they've hired less people to actually attend to all the customers properly. Food : 3/5 TEA here is fine. Moreover, I didn't know what to expect when I ordered a Chrysanthemum Tea & Oolong Tea. I can't say much about the teas. The murgh malai chicken sandwich was amazing.

Premjish Achari,Rated First of all its not a cosy place at all. Its a small room with closely arranged chairs without giving any room for privacy. The service is very bad.

Nivan Mamak,Rated If you're thinking this is a quiet place with books and soft chairs I suggest you turn back and look elsewhere. The rush and noise was maddening. The chairs were pretty uncomfortable and it's not like you can pick up a book and read it while you have tea. They didn't have some of their most interesting sounding drinks and their service was pretty bad. I made the mistake of ordering the tiramisu which tasted like big dollops of cream. The reason I gave it an extra .5 is that the iced tea I ended up ordering (Mixed berry) was decent.,Rated 1.5,34,31,??

What's better than sipping strong Assam tea (I am from Assam) and going through a bookstore? Well, it would be really cool if you could do both of them together. I was disappointed with the fact that I couldn't carry a book from the shelf into the adjoining restaurant nor could I take my cup to the bookstore despite both sharing the same commercial space.

But if you are going there to fetch some books and give sometime reading then this might not be the best place. Since its popularity, its quite noisy and gaining more attention for the variety of tea and coffee they have. We ordered keema samosa, french fries, lemon mouse, chocolate truffl, celery chicken and iceberg sandwich with peach ice tea and apricot exotic tea. The tea were really nice but the dessert could be better. Overall a very nice place to spend some time with books and friends (prefer friends).",Rated 3.0,45,370,??

Sanchi Arora,"Rated If you're a book person and expect a decent ambience, chai and some snacks around, Cha bar will hit the spot for you! Located in Connaught Place which obviously has too many options in terms of food, what stands out is the very concept, which is books and a wide variety of teas. A basic and decent ambience with shades of blue and white, do not expect quick service when it comes to your food. The waiters here tend to get a little confused and laid back while taking your orders, which is definitely a minus. Go for the many tea options and experiment a little, and the truck driver cha and masala cha will definitely stand out. The pasta is disappointing, the sandwiches however, are decent.

From an exquisite Oriental flavour to a rustic masala chai, there is a vast array to choose from. They serve it in beautiful teapots and glasses. For coffee lovers, this may not be the best place for perfectly brewed coffee but is decent enough. Pastas, panini, cheesecakes and sandwiches are excellent, although over time, the quantity has been reduced. Prices are low compared to other cafes in CP.

No, I did not notice if there was actually one :). As it goes, they have a bunch of options to pacify taste buds of any connoisseur of tea. We were there for a very short time on a Saturday afternoon, so I did not get a lot of time to read through every item on their menu. Just on the look of it, they have plenty of food options to go along with your choice of tea. Right from Samosas, sandwiches to a spread of different kinds of buns. They serve a variety of Muffins and Pastries as well to suit the sweet tooth. I would rather like to call it a sophisticated 'Tapri'. It's a perfect place for a chatterbox.

Sadly, it was crowded with some college students talking and shouting at the top of their voice that day. So it ruined it for me a little. I had their flavored iced tea and truck driver chai. Was good, and justified the price they costed. Thw staff was polite and courteous enough to give us suggestions while ordering. Overall a fine experience. Will like to visit again if the place is less crowded and a bit calm. Visit 2- this time it was muchhh better.

Rahul Batra,"Rated Books and tea, a sort of perfect combination which anyone can enjoy in solitude. I am not a tea lover, but this place has more to offer, good coffees and good food for sure. Located at the outer circle in the N block inside the Oxford book store, they have confirmed their place in our minds. I got introduced to this place by someone, and i believe such places should be introduced and not discovered. As it might have a different charm altogether. Taking a corner seat is the best option as they are packed for most of the times, to avoid the obstacles in your conversations. Service is sort of poor, you literally have to call the person twice at least to take your order or re-order in case you want to. But there is something in Cha Bar which outweighs all these negatives. First of all they have a good variety of tea, which i definitely didnt taste, but if you are a tea lover, try this Bar and Beer might become a taboo to you (Just kidding). even a cold coffee seems a little different to me over here, may be because i have a feeling they might sprinkle some tea in it. I had Passion Fruit Iced Tea, a good blend of both the flavors and an experience worth recommending as well. Just a small suggestion, sip in small quantities and let the taste settle in your taste buds and it will do wonders. For suppressing my hunger, ""Falafel and hummus in pita pockets"" was the choice, now this was a very good choice. The pita pockets look very beautiful but the only problem is that it cant hold properly what's inside. The fries tastes stale, yes management you really need to look in to it. Overall it was a good experience, and for sure worth visiting again, hoping to try newer items next time. Cheers... bragstreet.in",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Believe me this is one of the nicest combo i have seen till now though the cafe is not that big its small n compact but you'll not feel suffocating.

Avni Sharma,"Rated After the onslaught of coffee chains all across the country, the new generation of India is suddenly waking up to the worlds second most popular drink, tea. And Cha Bar blends it in with a superb book store and redefines the concept of Book Cafes. The small, intricately designed caf runs along the right hand side of the bookstore. Although food isn't permitted into the store, they are often accommodating and willing to serve at the back where wooden benches have been placed for the ones who prefer to just read and not buy. The place, true to it's name, serves over 200 varieties of chai. And many exotic versions as well, most interesting being Hapjan Black, which is from the owner's own estate. The menu is insanely populated and provides wholesome choices. Top favorites in the snacks are Fish & Chips and Panini Sandwiches. The service is a bit glitched and they fall short on it every time. On 3 out of my 5 visits here, some of the items were not available and the rest takes long to process. But otherwise, the place is refreshingly affordable and an elaborate meal for two would cost less than a grand. If you really want to spend more than a few hours here, then it is best to go on a weekday to really enjoy the amalgamation of Books, Brownies and Beverages.",Rated 3.5,37,494,??

It looks even better at night with all the lightings done. As the name suggests, cha bar offers a large variety of tea and all the flavours i have tried were amazing, from masala tea to jasmine tea to ginger cha or rose tea. The cold beverages are also delicious with a proper flavours . I would suggest one to have their iced teas as they score over the cold coffees. Peach, blackcurrant, raspberry, mint and passion fruit iced teas are all good. Coming to food, I've tried pastas, ginger chicken tikka wrap, non veg snack platter and they all taste good with subtle yet appealing flavours.

Anyhoo we had to wait for some 10 min and we were finally seated ordered masala cha , achari chikken tikka roll , sherbet , and chicken pasta in cream sauce ... The masala chai was good !!! though im not really a tea lover but it had its authentic taste ... sherbet was great .. I really liked it ..roll was okay .. Not really special but not bad either ..

I visited Cha Bar 2-3 days back and ordered the Malai Chicken Sandwich and Mint Ice tea. My friend ordered a Lemon Ice Tea. The staff was cooperative and warm. The sandwiches were really spectacular. The Mint Ice Tea was a little bitter and could have been sweeter, but the lemon ice tea pretty much made up for the shortcoming in the mint one.

However, I decided to settle for the most simple but widely loved 'masala cha'. The flavours and aroma are worth every penny. Complimented with omlette bun, it was one delightful snack. The place however has a small seating area thus contributing to a chatter noise. But once you are seated perfectly, everything at once, will fall into place. The staff is humble and helpfull.

Vansh Bhatia,"Rated My friend and I decided to visit the Cha Bar last sunday. Since my friend was a book lover (and incredibly hungry) just like me, I could not think of a better place. We started with the Keema Samosas along with two cups of Cappucinos. The Samosas were really well baked and the Keema tasted fresh. The Cappucinos on the other hand were not the best I had tasted and had to be sent back for adding a little more coffee. But that was just a minor blip. Next up, we ordered two Bun Kebabs which turned out to be excellent, the kebabs were soft and the bun not so soft as to crumble in the hands. Still not done, we ordered a Malai Tikka Sandwich and an Alfredo Pasta. Both of which were great , especially the sandwich (the pasta could have done with a little less spice) All il all we ate like kings and the best part was that it was incredibly light on the pocket (a paltry Rs. 700 for so much food). My rating is 3.5 for the food but an additional .5, just for the ambiance!",Rated 4.0,3,34,??

Tarpana Goswami,"Rated I came across this name while searching for a budget friendly cafe in CP. I have always wanted to visit a place where one can read a book over a cup of tea or coffee. Cha Bar is more like a cafe with shared entrance with the Oxford Bookstore rather than a book cafe. The place was full and we had to wait for 10 mins to get a table. Its a nice place to sit and chat. The stuff is courteous. Coming to the food, we ordered sandwich and fish & chips, the presentation was appealing, the taste average (not bad, mind it). The drinks were not satisfactory and the red velvet cake was a disaster. Overall, a decent place to hang out. Would like to visit this place again to for a cup of tea.

They've got a very huge menu of different types of Tea. Serve hot and cold coffees as well. Had ordered cold coffee. One chocolate flavoured and one regular cold coffee. There was a difference in colour but taste of both of them was same. Along with coffee I had ordered Apple & Cinnamon Pie. No other cake/pie were available.

Rohit Pathak,"Rated Was there in CP to meet a friend after long time and there is nothing better than catching up on the lost banter over a cup of coffee or tea. Going by the no. of people packed inside, I must admit its popularity stands validated. Moving on, it took us a good 15 mins. to find a place to sit. Staff is very nice. Ambience is ok kinda stuff. But what attracts people here is the fact that they have a good mix of things in their relatively large menu, plus it fits almost everyones pockets. I ordered a chocolate truffle pastry along with hot coffee. Friend accompanying me had cold coffee and some pasta. I don't remember. After a good 1.5 hrs we left the place, satisfied with both food and the chatter we had. Awesome. I noticed that there is a book store beside the place. So, I suppose people in habit of catching up on something interesting to read while sipping their favorite drink won't mind giving this place a try. Overall, it was a good experience here.",Rated 3.5,12,136,??

I really like the way they do the decorations according to festivals and different themes. Staff is very friendly and quick. I have probably tried everything on their menu by now, nothing I found exceptionaly good, but every dish offers value for money. Truckdriver chai is a must try though. Nice place to chit chat escpecially in summers when you do not want to be roaming around in the mad heat. It has always been my first choice when I have to meet someone and wish to have a conversation. P.S: They can consider making WIFI available.",Rated 4.5,16,87,??
Anshul Bansal,"Rated I have been to this place once. Its located inside the oxford bookstore. Its a small little noisy cafe (contrasting to the bookstore ambience). The seats are just ok (not extremely comfortable incase you were wondering). Now two things standout - the huge variety of chai(s) and the surprisingly delicious food. I wouldnt be surprised if they had atleast one tea flavor from every major country (atleast from the ones which are famous for their tea). The taste was quite unique and authentic. We ordered the same chai twice. Unfortunately the chai that we were served was just medium hot, we could have finished it in a couple of gulps. We complained but that didnt help the second serving. Now coming to the highlight of the evening - yes the food! I am not a foodie and I dont usually like the stuff that is served in cafes but I have to admit the snacks at this place were amazing. I will be cautious when I order chai next time (because the cold chai just doesnt cut it) but I would definitely go back for the food.",Rated 4.0,3,147,??
Sneha Kaushal,"Rated An absolute let down I am forced to say. Firstly and most importantly, the food was abysmal. Only and only the falafal and hummus pita pockets were worth eating. Also the age old problem of most restaurants, this place offers a pathetically slow service. On top of that they even forgot our order. We had to constantly remind them of it and that too not just to one but atleast three servers. I don't think that I would ever want to go back to this place. And lastly, for all that crappy food, they charged us a fortune! I did not understand the multiple types of taxes which they levied. Made our bill sky rocket by atleast 25%. So not at all recommended. At your own risk I would say.",Rated 2.5,7,58,??

We ordered one masala cha and one 100 mile ki cha with samosas.. it took quite a while waiting for the order, staff seemed well laid off and slow and didnt really seemed happy to see us (making me deduct .5 from the rating) that was frustating at first but then arrived our food _. Chai was just a perfect traditional home made chai served on a cool classic holder .. i personally liked 100 mile ki chai and somosas. Samosa so crunchy and soft and fresh and tasty.

Ivy Biswas,"Rated went there at around 3pm on thursday. the place and ambience is great but the only negative is the place is extremely tiny due to which there is always a long queue . the wait is long we had to wait for around 45 mins and some people simply left due to the long wait, even after that you have to snatch your table like a seat in the metro. the drinks hot and cold are great the food is alright and the service is alright given the rush there. we wanted to try the fish and chips and few more things but apparently everything was finished. so we had to settle for cafe latte, 100 mile truck drivers chai, the non veg platter, veg platter and chocolate truffle. the hot wings and kebabs in that were not very good but the sausages were alright. the place is a must visit due to its unique ambience.",Rated 3.5,27,24,??
Sheenam Varma,"Rated Where have I been all this while? I mean how can anyone not visit this little quaint cafe? Just too many positives,too many. To top it all inside a book store?So basically this a treat for all book lovers and also who love tea(indian and so many more flavours),coffee,European cuisine. Though the location is pretty unassuming and the only thing that catches your eye is the Oxford bookstore,suddenly you notice a small corridor where the Cha bar is built.It's cosy,beautiful and so light on the pocket that you can keep spending and need not worry at all.Trust me the most expensive item on the menu cost probably 120 bucks.That statement says a lot about the place.Ambience is simple and service is fine. The menu is huge! I mean number of teas they serve range from masala cha to I don't know English breakfast tea.I mean it's extensive. So my friend and I accidentally came to this place and after a lot of deliberation we decided to go for a ginger tea and cardamom tea. One doesn't leave without eating! So keeping in mind with the weather we ate the classic fish and chips. I tried the cardamom tea,it was served in a cute little glass and it was quite appropriate for the weather.Everything was perfect and it tasted well. My friend had the ginger tea.Liked it as well. The moment fish and chips arrived,the hungry monkeys within us woke up.That only means we ate at the speed of Rajdhani express,and soon realised we had run out of mayo.Hahaha! Fish was hot and crisp ,like it should be. And the tartar sauce was so creamy(I mean we had to order it again, obviously we loved it). All in all loved the place. The bill came and we were zapped because it was a surprise, a happy one. One can go again and again and again. Best part you don't need an occasion,you can drop in anytime.

Mallika Kaushal,"Rated My friend and I went to Cha Bar one fine evening of January. The place was packed so we were asked to wait in the waiting area, it took about 20-30 minutes before we got a table for 2. Meanwhile you can surf through the bookstore. We ordered a pasta arrabiata, a vegetarian paneer khurchan roll, a cold coffee and a strawberry smoothie. The service was prompt and efficient, and the food and drinks were upto the mark. Next we ordered two masala cha with a vegetarian snacks platter. The tea was great, while the snacks platter was merely an overpriced plate of average pakodas and a samosa.

Catherine,Rated Why would you pay rupees 35 for a 10 rupees masala chai. The reason is because this is Cha Bar and the teas are just excellent. If you want to just have tea and few light snacks this is a good place to go to. I went on a Friday and the place was completely full of people and was quite noisy as there were bigger groups. But this was good as it gave a cosy canteen feel to the place. I guess this is a good place to hand with friends though not ideal for a date unless it's a bit empty. Despite the crowd still the staff waited the tables well and orders were ready in about 5-10 minutes time. The chicken sandwiches were fresh and creamy. The cakes were yummy especially the chocolate truffle cake and the red velvet cakes. Other teas I will surely try out on later visits.,Rated 3.5,50,647,??

Ankit Chauhan,"Rated Visited this chic and cozy caffeine joint a couple of days back. To begin with they have an amazing placement being a part of bookstore. The place was full of customers ... well, moving on, the place was full but we managed to get a table after waiting for about a couple of minutes. The ambience was good and it looked even better with college goers and other such people. Now coming over to the F & B. The collection of tea and coffee was immaculate....the menu was quite impressive but over all the teas they had to offer i chose to have coffee instead. I ordered for a malabar coffee (i wanted a south indian filter coffee) and some rum and raisin muffins. The coffee that finally came was nothing close to a south indian filter coffee, i mean it was brought in the traditional kaapi cup with underlining cup and all, but being a barista myself i could make out that the blend of coffee used was rather a mix of arabica and robusta rather than a pure robusta as it should have been. It was consumed anyways as i didnt feel like bothering the very busy waitstaff. The muffin on the other hand was beautifully done. I loved the taste, it had the right mix of raisins (not too much) and the texture was great, made me order another portion. All in all it was a good experience....i would rather put it as my own fault ordering for a coffee at a ""cha"" bar....looking forward to visit soon to try some of their tea's.

The things I hate about this place is the fact that they don't let you read any book for more than 15 minutes, beyond when you'll have to purchase it or leave it right there. Further, their cafe is nowhere meant to satiate your taste buds; it's just to have a medium-ranged, not-so-great teas. Here's a catch: you can't take a book to the cafeteria unless you buy it - why?!

Neeru Singh,"Rated Oxford Now its a well-known fact that there is no bigger Book Caf than Oxford. The collection of books is humongous. Formed in 1920, this place has retained its essence even when the times have changed. Ive been regularly visiting the Bookstore for few years now and have witnessed the store go through its makeover. However, it has managed to retain its serene vibe, where one can just sit for as long and enjoy a read. I have spent days here, going through different books. I have learnt, felt inspired and motivated, just by observing or meeting different people out here. While Oxford bookstore helps you immerse yourself in a varied range of books, Cha bar, the bookstores caf lets you savour an equally diverse array of teas and food items. You can choose from exotic flavours like Moroccan mint, South African Rooibos, or the healthier options like herbal, green or Ayurvedic teas. In case you are looking for something simple, the ever-popular cutting chai never disappoints. Over the years, the food menu has also become bigger and the quality has certainly improved. The sandwiches and rolls are tasty and filling and provide a much needed respite from hunger pangs to avid readers. The Falafel rolls, English Sandwiches, Pita Wraps, Samosas, Frankies are delightful dishes. The dessert counter is full of pastries, muffins and cupcakes, that make you salivate. The colorful counter immediately catches your attention and all you want to do is dig into the pretty looking Red Velvet pastry. The masala tea I ordered for myself was divine. It had flavours of saunf (fennel), cinnamon and numerous other spices. It certainly becomes very difficult to choose from such a vast variety of teas, sourced not only from all parts of India, but the whole wide world. The presentation is earthy and unusual, the kettles look different and some of the teapots look quirky. I also like the caf for being so affordable. The classic masala cha- a fine blend of exotic spices, costs a humble Rs. 35-40. The pricing of the food and beverages is excellent, the main reason why its so popular among the students. The downside is, the bookstore or caf dont provide Wi-Fi or any kind of charging points. So, you cant really work on your laptop, for too long. Another rider is that the music can get a bit too loud for those looking to enjoy a quite reading session. For obvious reasons, youre not allowed to take any book from the bookstore to the caf for casual reading. A place to read, eat and get lost in the world of books, Oxford Bookstore and Cha-bar, serve a ravishing combo for book lovers who cherish their tea. eatstory.in",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Tried their chilli cheese toasties expecting a lot better, but i was handed sort of regular bread baked with a little cheese and chilli flakes. It tasted allright wih the tea though, nothing spectacular. Their iced teas are good too, specially the passion fruit flavour. Not a fan of their organinc teas though, perhaps not really my taste! Even with average food, this place is so worth a visit. Specially if you are a book worm, your cha will taste mighty fine with all the books around you.

Foodie Ahlawat,"Rated This has been on my list for a long time. It used to be our hangout during college days when Oxford bookstore was in Statesman building I think. Finally on a cold winter afternoon we decided to re-live college days in Cha Bar. It was fairly easy to locate and is located inside the bookstore on first floor. It wasn't too crowded surprisingly & we got a table easily. The servers 'looked busy' and the service was very slow! Most of what we ordered was just 'heat in microwave' stuff so should have been fast. Even the pastry took its own sweet time (read 7minutes) to arrive from the counter to our table (10metres). We ordered the following: Truck driver 100 mile ki cha - Normal tea that we drink at home, nothing extraordinary, was a little cold as well. Katakali Cha - I ordered this following reviews I read on Zomato but was fairly disappointed. I know you can't go wrong on a Rs35 tea but they did unfortunately. Keema Samosas - 3/5 - Two big samosas came with tomato ketchup. They had clearly been made before & were microwaved hence weren't crispy. It was supposed to contain minced mutton but tasted a lot like mutton+some dal. I think Rs 120 is enough to serve some real meat but sadly that wasn't the case. Three Chilli Cheese Toasties - 5/5 - The best part of our lunch! The bread was right amount of crispy with perfect amount of melted cheese on top with red & green chilies. They used white but I would have preferred brown bread. Bun Kebab - 2/5 - It was supposed to have mutton kebab patty but it tasted of soya patty. We even asked the server to confirm if this was really non vegetarian. Well then maybe at Rs 60 we should have expected some adulteration! Red Velvet Pastry - 2/5 - I am in love with red velvet & try it wherever I can see one. Sadly it lacked flavor & my friend actually mistook it for strawberry. The color was also not thick red like it is supposed to be so I am sure there were other unwanted ingredients in it. Overall the experience was disappointing for us or maybe we had too high expectations. We felt a little better when the bill of Rs 523 arrived. I mean there are not a whole lot of places in CP where two people can eat for that much (in a hygienic environment of course!). I give it an extra 0.5 points for being reasonably priced. Caution - Steer clear of non vegetarian food items & you will not be much disappointed.",Rated 3.5,107,234,??

The interior decor was very simple and cool types. Starting with the orders we ordered a Kathakali Cha for me and a lemonade for friend, Chicken shawrma, cous cous salad and a red velvet pastry. Kathakali Cha was super and I was really impressed by the simple yet delectable taste of the tea. Lemonade was also fine. They have just simply mixed water, lemon juice, soda and sugar and served it. There was nothing so special about it but sometimes simplicity is the thing which you need. Red velvet pastry was fresh and perfectly soft and it literally melted in my mouth. Shwarma was also good and was served with mayonnaise. Shawrma lacked a little tanginess. Cous cous salad was good. Prices at this place are quite reasonable. Their service lacked a bit as there were too many people there. In a nutshell it was a good experience and I'll surely visit there again.",Rated 3.5,16,74,??

Akanksha Singh,Rated A very good and pocket friendly cafe with an in build library. Their truck driver 100 mile chai is too good. They have good bakery items too. The only turn off is that it is too crowded.,Rated 4.0,84,90,??
Vaishnavi Venkat,"Rated Cha bar is a great place for all the tea lovers in this city.They have a wide variety of teas and serve decent desserts.Their food is just okay,nothing great. I like their English tea cake and its something I'd recommend.Tried their velvet cake once and I have decided not to order that ever again. So if you're in CP and looking for a budget friendly place that serves good drinks,Cha bar is definitely a good option. I'd really like to spend some time reading a book with a cup of tea but because this place is mostly crowded and noisy,I dont think that's going to be possible.",Rated 3.5,36,179,??
Mrinali Menon,"Rated Cha Bar was a difficult place to find though. It's nicely situated on the Oxford Bookstore area with a comfortable spacing adjacent to the library. It has always been pretty full whenever one goes in the evening hours. Due to its small seating capacity, its difficult to grab a seat, however the beautiful decor is worth a treat.Their mocktails and fish and fries are good to order, followed by their masala chai.Nice place for a hush rush coffee. :)",Rated 3.5,10,182,??
Malavika Kathuria,Rated Though I preferred the earlier Cha Bar ( in Statesman house) this one is lovely nevertheless. The cha bar is a perfect place to bring together a perfect combination of hot beverages and books. Avid readers swear by this place ....

Prajjwal Singh,Rated A great place if you're looking to spend some leisure time. Best part is the attached oxford bookstore. Red Velvet Cake is a must if you go here.

Overall a good experience.,Rated 3.5,1,72,??
Shweta Sachdeva,"Rated Finding this Bar was a bit tough, since it is placed out of the way from the usual route we tend to take. Located snugly inside a very very spacious and beautiful Bookstore, I was instantly taken with the place! Food and Books - now that's money well spent! Being New Year's eve today, the rush was something! The crowd was definitely a sophisticated bunch, with several foreigners occupying most of the seats. We waited a good half hour (not a bother for me as I got to spend more time scanning the books) before these really good people took sympathy on us and finished up fast and gave us their seats! Having scanned the Menu dozens of time on Zomato (yes, I'm guilty of this heinous crime ;) ), I knew what I wanted. But owing to the rush hour today, I was robbed of my chance to try their amazing Pasta. Instead we ordered a Classic Fish n' Chips, Shammi Kebab Sandwiches, a Blackcurrant Smoothie and one Cold Coffee with ice cream. Our drinks arrived first and might I tell you, their Blackcurrant Smoothie was the real deal! With bits of Blackcurrant and oodles of yogurt, I already knew this was going to be my favorite place in CP! The coffee was a bit on the bitter side, but I'm not complaining! The fish and chips were hot and succulent! Served with mayo, they are juicy and soft. My sandwiches arrived the last. Looked every bit as appetizing as they tasted! The atmosphere was filled with conversations and people waiting to grab a seat. It's definitely a place where you can sit for hours and talk about anything under the sun! If not for the food, the stacks of beautifully arranged books will make any Bookworm's day! This place certainly made an impression on me, so much so that I already have planned my next visit: a bowl of their pasta and a book in my hand. Bliss! UPDATE: On my second visit to Cha Bar, I was left a bit disappointed. For this time I had ordered their Red Pasta (the White sauce was not available) and Chicken Wings along with Bollywood Masala Chai. Man, none of them was any good. The food let me down, but the ambiance and over all atmosphere didn't.",Rated 4.0,74,152,??

But to my surprise there were some things i did not like, the service at the cha bar, they made me wait oo long and made one feel unwanted, secondly the menu was totally in a disaster condition and i am attaching the photos for the same,The oxford people as like ikd times had no clear idea of books you were looking for, just showing a person the allocated area to keep books of a particular category in not the only solution to be done....Overall i revised my old memories...cheers....",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Shubhi,"Rated A saturdayn night chilly evening when you are looking for a place for Coffee or tea and when CP seems to be flooded with people already taking over a majority of hot spots consider CHA CHA CHA!! A place built inside the Oxford Bookstore (love the concept), amidst a stack of books, its a delight to look at! An extremely small seating area, with very few on the staff, Saturday evening seemed chaotic. The servers just seemed to be on their toes throught the time we were there. Maybe it was the chilly Saturday evening! Coming to the food. We wanted to order Salads but they were unavailable :( . But an exciting variety of numerous teas are available (I got throughly confused, not too much knowledge on tea) My friend and I decided to go for Tiger Hill tea and ashwagandha (still confused if we should have asked for milk or just gulped them down). The aroma is definitely something that will hold your attention, I just wanted to smell rather than drink the tea :P Along with the tea are the snacks. We ordered a Nutty English Cake and a Vegetable snack platter ( an Indian's delight for snack cravings with tea is completed with this dish). The snack platter has a Samosa, pakodas- both Onion and Mirchi and crispy Paneer offered with Ketchup and mint sause (unavailable again :(, so we were given mustard). Next time we try coffee as well. Of the things we tried. I recommend: Nutty english cake, vegetable snack platter, tea (experiment, too many available) Go there for a quiet time rite besides books to strike a decent conversation!",Rated 3.5,29,14,??

As i entered the oxford bookstore, the place was buzzing with liveliness and to my expectations, cha bar was truly a cozied up place giving one a warm feeling. I had to wait for 20 mins approximately to get a table for me and my other 4 family members. The staff was courteous and guided us to the waiting area.. But had to be on my toes for getting a place for 5 people arranged since the setup was small and buzzing with people. Eventually after getting seated ordered for ginger teas, cappuccino, chocolate caffe latte, english tea cake, assam tea, french fries, veggie snacks platter and cucumber and cheese sandwich.. The food lived up to my expectations.. And definitely value for money.. assam tea and english tea cake are must haves.. Veggie snacks platter can be assorted with different items since we didnt really like mirch pakoras and onion fritters.. Overall a must go place for all cha lovers :)",Rated 4.0,5,39,??
Rajenki Das,"Rated Lovely place. Amazing ambience. Pocket friendly. BUT what's the use if it cannot bring the food we want? Most of the times, Cha Bar has failed to provide the items from the menu that I desire. Hence, it holds me back from visiting the place. The only reason I may end up in the cafe is due to the bookstore. Hope that they can start maintaining the availability of all listed items almost all the time.

The price are reasonable, unlike the exorbitant pricing of Starbucks and its likes. The only thing that turned me off was the service. The spoon I got was used, when I informed the waiter about it, he took the spoon and never returned to replace it :P Except for that, I left satisfied because of three reasons. 1.

I doubt any person who doesn't absolutely love coffee would be able to have the coffee without the ice cream. The pastry was okay and I've had better honestly. The chip bowl had everything fried and thus was obviously tasty!! I'd visit it again to try more stuff like the rolls and fish n' chip bowl. The main problem was there is a long waiting on a weekend.

Apoorva Verma,"Rated Books and tea.. Need I say more? The whole place has a feel good factor to it and I loved and could spend hours browsing through the books and well there is always tea and munchies if you wanna take a break. It fascinates me and it was about time someone made a haunt like this. It's become quite popular in a very little time. For me it was an accidental discovery.. Which I loved! Located at C.P it attracts masses. What I loved: 1. The concept is simple but genius. You look at it and think .. Why hasn't this been done before. 2. The space is open, well made and the incorporated tea and munchies stall is surrounded by the literature. There is ample place to sit and read, a must for book lovers. 3. The variety of teas are a delight and the I love the way they present their teas.. The cute cup holders, the ethnic tea pots, they are like eye candy to me! 4. The staff is happy to serve you and nice to talk to when the place isn't crawling with people. Nit picking : 1. The staff could be friendlier and work on their people skills .. But that's just me nit picking and holds true to almost all joints. 2. The place is a little away from everything else in C.P and is one of the factors why many people think it's a newly opened joint when it's been a around for a while now. There is nothing really that I dislike about this place, but then again I've just been here twice and didn't have anything but tea.. So I might edit it if and when I visit it again.. For now, this is my verdict.",Rated 4.0,68,315,??

Really a nice place to relax with a cuppa(or two) of tea, a book from the Oxford store or a chit chat session with friends. Absolutely loved the concept and the place.

Swrang Varma,Rated Before I start I'd just like to say that I've been to this place so many times that it'd be an exercise in futility trying to talk about every item on the menu and every experience I've had there so I'll just give a collective review. The most obvious reality that screams at you in the face is that yes for the decent quality of food it serves in terms of quality and quantity it is friendly to your pocket. People mainly come here for the pleasant experience of reading a book along with some coffee the Oxford bookstore beside it being the biggest advantage. As the name suggests this spot is mainly a tea haven. The first 10 odd pages of the menu are pretty much just scores of different kinds of tea which a self-confessed tea enthusiast like me would like to add they've got quite a spectacular and impressive range of teas. Not like I'm complaining anyway. I have tried pretty much every cuppa on the menu and I don't really have the patience to talk about each one so I'll just list out the ones I think are worth trying. Ready? *takes a deep breath* Okay here we go: khobong sessa dimbula jasmine marigold vervain blue orange peel dragonball long gin thyme verbena thai lemon grass. That wasn't that exhaustive a list but well it should get you started on the journey of tea exploration. Coming to the bites they're obviously not a tea bar's main focus. Fair warning though: don't go in expecting too much. They're pretty much just side dishes. The wood fired chicken caesar's salad is just fine. They have a few decent sandwiches like the falafel and hummus in pita pockets egg mash and kasundi and the celery chicken and iceberg club sandwich but my favorite has to be the tuna and pickled onion chutney panini sandwich which is also probably their best effort when it comes to the food. Cha Bar doesn't do shwarmas very well and as a shwarma addict I can assure you that it'd be best to just steer clear. The bread is raw cold and hard and the meat is quite clearly half-heartedly cooked. Everything a shwarma is not supposed to be. The rest of the bites are quite satisfactory though. I have tried the ginger chicken tikka wrap kebav meshwi wrap with hummus and the choley frankie in spiced pita wrap which I honestly quite liked even though it's vegetarian. The bun tikki burger is JUST passable for a burger. Sometimes. I make it sound quite grim but most of the food is just fine nothing that particularly smashes the walls of your mouth spawning delight. That said the pastries and cakes here are something one should definitely try out. In particular the chocolate truffle apple & cinnamon pie and english tea cake stand out. I found the decor a little hit-and-miss and quite out of place but at least the tables and the little flower-in-the-granite holder thing redeems them. The service here tends to be a bit sluggish sometimes but they're also quite friendly and helpful when required. All in all it's a nice place to go to when you just want to sit down in the comfort of a book and tea and not be disturbed.,Rated 3.0,16,253,??
Gargi,"Rated A quaint little place, right inside the Oxford bookstore, it was my kind of place! The tea was of course good and so were the muffins!

The songs they play are soothing. And another great thing about this place is that it's not at all expensive. I'm giving this place 4 on 5 just because of the staff. They seem uninterested you've to repeatedly call them otherwise they don't even bother to come and take the order and then sometimes they'll serve you the wrong one.

Robin Abraham,"Rated I had read some great reviews about this place so decided to check this out with my cousins. Enjoyed the first time we were here. Good food, good service, good ambience. Unfortunately the experience hasn't been consistent. The next 2 times we tried the place, service was horrible. The serving staff will not even acknowledge you till you literally walk up to the counter and demand attention. No smiles, curt demeanour, it almost seems that the employees are overworked and unhappy. Food is decent though again we did face a minor issue with a glass of cold coffee that tasted more like Bournvita. I did enjoy their Shawarma wraps & club sandwiches. Their variety of coffees and teas are also impressive. Definitely value for money if you can put up with the moods of the serving staff. Us cousins have decided to move on. At the end of the day, we'd like to see some cheery eyed people to make our experience wholesome.",Rated 2.5,2,14,??

Sushant Arora,"Rated Surrounded by Oxford book store area from three sides, Cha Bar is not just a regular tea shop but a cave full of treasure for tea lovers. We group of three had an array of things which include: TEA If you go through the menu you get puzzled looking at myriad options of tea under several categories and various exotic varieties. Even multiple visits here will not satisfy your quest to try every variant. Each one had a nice description of two-three lines on menu. Taiwanese oolong with Chinese long gin tea It was a fusion of Chinese green tea and Taiwanese fruity tea. The fragrance itself was highly refreshing. Brown sugar was given with the tea. When I consumed just one sip, I was sure it was one of the best I ever had. The flavor, smell and green tea properties enhanced my senses. One of finest in every aspect and is indeed a must try. Purple Rose tea This was Darjeeling tea with elderberries and currants. It was served in a tea pot which had option to squeeze leaves to increase flavor of tea. It was another finest tea form with amazing aroma and out of the world taste. Passion fruit iced tea This was the first time I tried this flavor in an iced tea. It was in every facet much better than regular iced tea. Blackcurrant iced tea Another iced tea variant which also had nice and sweet taste. So, every tea form deserved 100 percent score. OTHER BEVERAGES Lemonade It was refreshing and gave taste of homemade Shikanji. Cha Bar Thandai It was not totally authentic form of thandai. The flavor though fine resembled that of sweet color coated saunf. Cold Coffee with ice cream As per attendants, ice cream was blended in cold coffee but still taste was very average. FOOD Veg Alfredo Pasta Regular white sauce pasta with nice white sauce. Basil Pesto and Vegetable Panini- We customized it with brown bread (multi grain was not available that time) and got it grilled. It was a regular sandwich with veggies. Cha Piazi These were a small plate full of onion and green chilli pakoras. They tasted fine with tea. Flurys Famous Ratatouille Puff Roll It was regular puff roll filled with capsicum and other regular veggies. Unlike its name, there was nothing worth being famous about it and it tasted like regular puff roll which you can get from bakeries or metro station shacks. Red Velvet Nice and soft pastry red velvet pastry. AMBIANCE It is a compact caf with entry from three sides of Oxford bookstore. The tables and chairs are also of compact nature. On the roof, you can see bell shaped lights in a rounded string which is interesting. One wall had dark color with some Christmas themed accessories. You will most of the within their twenties or thirties. SERVICE Everything was served within few minutes of order. When asked about details related to items in the menu, most of the attendants didnt know them. They just smiled telling I dont know sir. Still, they were happy to serve and provided extra cups and stuff when asked. Bill Total bill for all above mentioned items came Rs 1350 which is reasonable. As a whole, though food is average but place itself deserves 4 stars for the variety of tea it serves. It can also be nice hangout for bunch of friends.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The book area is pretty huge and you can wait there without getting bored but you can not take the book in the caf area.,Rated 4.5,28,20,??
Apoorv Mahalwar,"Rated I had been longing to visit cha bar since quite some. I finally got the chance to do so a couple of days back. The ambiance of is quite good. The service is average and I think the place is understaffed a bit. Coming to the food and drinks, we ordered a rum flavoured tea, green ice tea and hot chocolate along with bun maska, samosa sandwitch and cha piaza for snacks. The real treat among the beverages was the green ice tea. Simply splendid. Each and every flavour was simply perfect. Highly recommended. The rum flavoured tea was ordinary while the hot chocolate was a let down. Among the snacks, the Bun Maska was my favourite. The bread was really soft with generous quantity of butter used. The samosa sandwitch was great too. Cha piaza consists of onion and chilli 'pakoras' which were very ordinary. Nothing special. All in all, it is a great place. Cha Baar has redefined the way tea is looked at with the 155 varieties of tea's they offer.",Rated 4.5,20,79,??
Va,"Rated food was not so good .. I came here because of a review of this place from an indian blogger saying that this was a great place and good value for money . I can say I went as a group of 4 and had the smoked chicken sandwich with dry bread and a cha bar blend tea . The other 3 had a paneer wrap or roll , another had a chicken shawarma and then a dish of fish and chips . I was very shocked to find the fish was served partially raw from the inside and there were very little chips to eat with it . The bill totaled to about 600 rupees . If you want to have a small snack I would recommend having a tea or coffee with a pastry or cake , not food items . We went on a Saturday so the place was full when we arrived but if you wait a few minutes you will get a table . The environment is nice because this cafe is located inside of Oxford Bookstore . I was expecting to eat some delicious snacks and drinks at this place but sadly it was not up to my expectations .",Rated 1.5,12,21,??

As soon as you enter the Oxford library, the warmth of the place immediately makes you like it. It's the best place ever for even chai lover, however even for coffee drinkers, you have to try their malabar coffee. It is extremely well blended and in the right proportion of everything. This is not the place if you are looking for true pasta. Things which are must eat are bun maska and three cheese toasties. Also ordered pesto panini which has no spinach and basil paste but only Mayo. Cheese and cucumber tea sandwiches are a much better option.

Tulika Sharma,"Rated This one has been on my list for ages. Finally managed to visit CHA bar. How come being in CP I had not visited this place for so long was my only response at the end of my visit. After an exhausting day both of us went to Cha. I loved the concept of the place. Located on first floor of CP N block just opposite statesman building I crossed it twice and then realised it doesnt have a separate entry. Inside the oxford library its a small cafe serving tea and snacks. I wont call it a book cafe as it is crowded and super noisy, which personally I dont prefer while reading. It was around 6 in evening and the place was full. The place was small and the kitchen was near entrance. We managed to get a table for two and settled. We started with two masala tea, smoked chicken mustard sandwich, cha piazi and bun kebab. I really liked the spices in my tea but wanted it to be stronger. The chicken sandwich was great. It had amazing flavours of mustard and the smoked chicken in every bite. The bun kebab, our desi version of burger looked so attractive but it was very dry as there was no cream or mayo between the slices. The cha piazi was a mix of onion pakora and chilli pakora. They had not removed the seeds from chilli and that made it very ho. I enjoyed it. This didnt fill our tummy so we went for our second round of orders. We ordered a kathakali tea, cha blend, chicken wrap, pasta arrabiata and red velvet cake. The chicken wrap was nicely done with loads of chicken filling with a tangy taste to it. The only dish which disappointed us was pasta. The sauce was undercooked and had a taste of raw tomato. The red velvet cake was so fresh and creamy and worth trying. The best thing for the day was kathakali tea. I ordered one more after this. I can go to CHA daily for this one tea. It was strong blended with loads of spices and right amount of sugar. In one word...WOW!!! The staff was courteous and attentive. The best thing about the place it doesnt burn a hole in your pocket.

Smriti R@n@,"Rated This is one tea shoppe you need to visit if you are in Delhi and are a tea fanatic as well like me. Had been hearing about this place since quite some time now from my sister, so decided to check it out this Saturday afternoon. Its situated inside the Oxford bookstore in Connaught place, so you can conveniently commute by metro to get to this place. First of all, in comparison to the crowd they get, the seating space needs major ramping up (it should be doubled, i believe). Though i understand that quaintness is the key to any tea place, this one is a popular joint leading to a long waiting time and the slow service and few servers doesnt help the cause. Anyways after waiting for about 20 minutes and then literally lunging at and almost fighting with a cute guy for the table, we got a nice corner table. Sifted through the menu and ordered a lot for three people as we were damn hungry. Tried the Mediterranean Cous Cous salad, was a little bland to my cousin's taste, but i quite liked it. It was nice, fresh, had raisins n walnuts. All in all a 3.5/5. Then we had the Cheese chilli toasties..i'd say 4/5 but could have been better if they were hotter and cheese was melted., slow service to blame. My cousin usually loves the 'Cha samosas' served here, the smaller ones, but this time around we got the big ones bursting with aloo. We get way better at any Delhi sweets shop,,Din like them at all.,,so a 2/5 . Then we had Fish and chips, the batter was spicy and the fish was well cooked and piping hot,, @120 bucks it was the cheapest fish dish (..it rhymes) i ever had,,and super yum (a 4.5/5). The best thing about Cha bar,,goes without saying is its tea. I am a self confessed tea addict n a maniac at times, and let me tell you i do not like tea at 99 percent of the places i have it at. But this place i can go to n go to n go to,,to have just the tea. I ordered the Masala tea,,loved it and quickly reordered. It wasnt strong but wasnt bland like most coffee shops or hotels its served at.(5/5) It was amazing and its a must have thing if you visit Cha bar anytime soon.,,which you should.",Rated 4.5,4,40,??

Siddhi Jain,"Rated Time: Friday afternoon. Waiting time: Zero. Crowd: Buzzing with people. Order: one latte, one cappuccino, one elaichi chai, one bun tikki,one red sauce chicken pasta, one paneer roll, one piaza, one thandai, one red velvet pastry and one nan khataai. Bill: 911 ( with taxes) Apart from the chai, the food was pretty much average. The piaza or in local language, pyaaz and mirchi ke pakode were okay, the chutney doesn't have much tang though (chutney's more important, no?). The bun tikki was good, sort of like a Desi burger. The coffees needed a lot of sugar ( and mean like a looooot) to be sweet enough for drinking. The red sauce pasta wasn't on the menu so they charged extra for assembling it..just giving us a dish for which they already had the sauce and the chicken. The paneer roll was fine. Only if the chutney were good enough! Red velvet was a miss for me because it's an improvised version. Didn't finish it. Nan khatai had a grated coconut layer on top. Not a coconut fan, didn't like it. Thandai was okayish. The service is something everyone around me wasn't happy with either. They were Slow. But frankly the two ends of the room are too far and there isn't enough space for the staff to stand between the tables. The music is hardly audible. The only plus is that everything is cheap.

Aparajita Chattopadhyay,"Rated For a bookworm like me Oxford bookstore is like a second home but for the last few months, its not just the books that have been motivating me to visit the place but this little cafe that has opened right inside it- the Cha Bar The ambiance is pretty simple, with marble tables and steel chairs. I love the minimalistic decor ( apart from the giant chandelier). You can easily judge the popularity of this place considering the fact that at any point of time, you have to atleast wait for 15-20 minutes to be able to get a table. Once you have settled down, you are greeted by this extravagant menu that contains over 150 varieties of tea. Out of the the ones I have tried till date I would recommend the bollywood masala mix cha( the tea comes in these colorful tea pot with bollywood divas painted on them), Truck Driver 100 Mile ki Cha which has this amazing taste of ginger, rose tea...slightly sweet but more than the taste its the fragrance that makes me order it....you have to try to understand what I am talking about and last but not the least the cinnamon cha...might prove to be a little strong for people who are not used to the taste of cinnamon but for a cinnamon lover like me its heaven in a cup. Coffee lover might feel a little ignored as choices are a little limited. But out what's available, the cappuccino, the spiced cappuccino(another drink with loads of cinnamon) and chocolate mocha are pretty decent. In the cold beverage sections try the mint ice tea...its just perfect for summers, the raspberry ice tea...its on the sweeter side but love the blend of sweetness of the raspberries with the bitterness of the tea and the classic hazelnut cold coffee. For sides with your beverage, my recommendations would be the bun tikki( our desi burger with crispy aaloo tikki) , the samosa sandwich( this one is definitely very filling), fusilli alfredo( love the consistency of the sauce), chicken pot pie( absolutely delicious!!!!), chili cheese toasties( another indian tea time classic however its not very spicy) and platter of chips with dip( ask for the mayo dip). The dessert bar greets you as soon as you enter the place however I was left a disappointed with most of them except the apple & cinnamon cake, the chocolate chip muffin...vanilla muffin with big chunks of chocolate in it and the red velvet pastry...not the original one but its good. The only downside to this place is the service. Most of the stuff on the menu is unavailable, on multiple occasions we had to wait a good 25 minutes before our order arrived and even then the order was incomplete. I am not really fond of the staff either as they really slow, clumsy( the servers keep bumping into each other and fall with the orders all the time) and some of them are down right rude. The saving grace however is the tea, which they have mastered, the cozy ambiance and the fact that its absolutely pocket friendly.",Rated 4.0,11,31,??
Priyali Prakash,"Rated This little cafe inside the Oxford bookstore in CP has become the hot favourite of Delhiites since some time. To call it a book cafe would be wrong because this place is always bustling with chirpy people and does not offer the silence that book cafes are generally associated with. However, if the noise does not bother you, you could just pick up a book from the store and read it here with some amazing and unique flavours of tea available. The place also has an amazing and different decor, which looks livelier when all lighted up in the evenings. Cha bar justifies its name by offering close to 125 varieties of tea, ranging from the elite English breakfast tea and the chamomile tea to the rustic truck driver 100 mile ki cha and the old favourite masala cha. The place also offers a variety of flavoured iced teas and coffees, the raspberry iced tea and the spiced cappuccino being personal favourites. Apart from the beverages, this place also has nibbles to go perfectly with tea. People are generally seen ordering chilly cheese toasties and samosas. For those with a sweet tooth, chocolate truffle is the best choice whereas the red velvet cake is somewhat a letdown. This place offers perhaps the best fish and chips, the classic English delicacy, in the given price range. It is quite possible that if you visit this place during the evening, they would have run out of the dish. The place has become so popular that during weekends and holidays, it is difficult to grab a table here. Given all the good and the affordable food, the service here is quite slow, no matter what time of the day it is and how many customers are being attended. Also, a major drawback is that you have to pay for water. All in all, Cha Bar is definitely worth trying once.

Abhishek Nagar,"Rated Nov 3rd, 2014 7:45 pm 'A Reader's Dreamland' was my first and is my lasting impression of Cha Bar. Teas and coffees, hot and cold. Ample choices of snacks and some dishes too. With the Oxford Book Shop housing Cha Bar inside it, I do not suppose a reader could ask for anything more. Ambience: I would describe the place as quaint and cozy. With three huge chandeliers, like open umbrella frames, hanging from the ceiling, a black wall with black wooden knobs of various sizes and blue arches leading to the various sections of the Oxford book shop, the place definitely grabs your attention and leaves you comfortable and relaxed to be there. Service: The staff was aware of the food and beverages in the menu. Also, got a suggestion for their best ice tea, when asked for it. But as it turned out, our server was not that helpful after all. Food: Passion Fruit Ice Tea. It was served in a tall glass with the black straw barely able to float out of the tea. The tea did not disappoint. Neither the tea nor the passion fruit was over powering the other. Almost the perfect balance. Three Chilli Cheese Toast. I was fairly warned by my company that they don't always have the ingredients, so we asked our server if we could have the toast with all the ingredients, viz. Jalapeos, Red Chilli, Green Chilli. He didn't check with the kitchen, but he responded in the affirmative. The white bread with crusts cut out was toasted to a good golden brown. The cheese was yummy and stringy, it was in perfect quantity, not too much to over power the chillies and not too less to be missed. But sadly, the jalapeos were missing. We had red chilli flakes and chopped green chillies sprinkled over our toast. When asked about the missing ingredient, the server casually responded that it must be in there somewhere. Nothing hurts the sentiments of a foodie when the food is not as it was promised. Also, the sauce served along with the toast was the average chilli ketchup, it was bit of a let down For now.. 3.5/5 Will return for more, with high expectations.",Rated 3.5,11,27,??

The special teas are served in cups and kettles unique to the place and is generally an elaborate affair. Coming to food, the place offers some seriously delicious quiche.

Stuti Tripathi,Rated Cha Bar until recently used to be on my list of places with good ambiance and quality food at reasonable prices. My recent visit literally made me sick with food poisoning after ordering their chocolate truffle which tasted like sour curd and smelled rotten with the waiter blaming me for ruining the pastry. The dish despite being replaced after an argument over its quality was no different than the previous one. Their shakes have more water and ice than milk these days and apparently these people dont know what kind of a dish tiramisu is or how it is prepared.

Bhavna,"Rated I had visited Cha Bar on 26-10-14. Highly disappointed with their slow service. Me and my friend took up a seat right next to the cafe counter, one of the first few tables in the front. The SLOW SERVICE had disappointed me the last time too when i visited with a few friends. This time around the staff managed to give me good enough reasons to just stop going there. The tables were dirty, no one bothered to come and clean it. We had first ordered for tea and some snacks. First they served us the keema burger after 10mins of placing the order, 15mins following this came the tea, and another 20-25mins after this came the chilli toasties, by the time we were done with the tea and burger. There were no tissues kept at the table. When we did ask for the tissues, the waiter got us two tissues and in a hurry just put it on that dirty table and left. Now we were waiting for our red velvet cake. It came after 15-20mins again. As soon as i took the first bite, i knew it was STALE!!!.. it was dry and hard like a toast. Three waiters attended me after that and i told each one that YOUR CAKE IS STALE, to which no one even said a sorry. IRRITATED and ANGRY, i asked them to get my bill with the suggestion page. The bill came but not the suggestion page, so we asked for it. I filled it, for the first time ever gave my number to a cafe on their suggestion page, hoping they will revert. They didnt. These guys aren't one bit courteous or chivalrous. The same cafe, in bangalore, gives an entirely different experience. TOO BAD CHA-BAR DELHI, your STAFF'S INFLATED EGO WONT GET YOU MORE CUSTOMERS. GET TO WORK AND FIX THE BASICS, CLEANLINESS AND QUICK SERVICE TO BEGIN WITH. I will never get my friends here anymore. There are SO MANY better places in delhi to have amazing tea and breakfast with a good experience to take home.",Rated 1.5,1,1,??

Abhi,Rated Food is ok. Not very good. Ambience is good. The place seems inexpensive if you look at the menu but i guess quantity wise it is not so. I ordered their Cha Bar blend- the first item on the menu. Nothing is mentioned about the tea being separate. Taste wise i could not find anything special in it. It was a normal tea. You have to pay separately for water - which is not a good idea. Again the aloo chips/fingers etc with dips was pretty normal. I might try their masala tea next time in order to come to a decent conclusion. Nothing encourages me to visit the place again. May be the best is yet to come.,Rated 2.5,14,12,??

An extensive menu of teas, you can choose anything you like and enjoy it with a slice of cake or with cookies, or as you please. They have snacks as well such as shawarma, which was decent in taste. I also ordered BBQ chicken which was the only downer in t he entire scheme of events. Loved, loved the desserts! the blueberry muffin and the red velvet cake! Lip smacking!

You can read while you eat, you can work on your laptop, you can do spend time here doing anything. As the name suggests 'Cha Bar', it is the place for tea lovers. There are like hundreds of varities of tea. The menu is really vast. The decor is blue and white and it is very cute. I have been there on weekends and it is always crowded. It is hard to find a place to sit. The seating is close and the area is not that big as you can see in the pictures. The servers seem too busy all the time and you may have to call them twice or thrice if you need something. The food is very much pocket friendly and it is decent taste wise. We have tried Fish and chips (just 120 bucks), mini burgers, chicken lollipops, pasta. Beverages like cold coffee, ice tea are average.

But the time you enter in the cafe its so noisy there, you'll never be able to read a book. The best part is I don't like reading books :P Staff was not attentive as it was too much crowded and there were only 2-3 waiters. Luckily we got the table but even after waiting for 5-10 minutes. No one came to attend us. I called him and ask to clean the table. Then again I asked him for menu and again to take the order. You'll have to call them for every single thing 1-2 times whether it be menu, my order or bill So just 2.5 for service. But fortunately food arrived in just few minutes. Food: We ordered ""Cold Coffee with Ice cream"", ""Chocolate Milk Shake"", ""Paneer wrap"" and ""Chips platter with Dip"". Drinks were first-rate. Paneer role and Chips were also good.

Now coming to the tea and snacks served. Its commendable how they provide you with a long list of different types of beverages.Each tea is presented in a unique way.The presentation is superb. The food is very average,so it isnt really a place to just snack without having tea.You can easily find better food at any other random cafe in delhi.

Tushar Gupta,"Rated This place absolutely did not look like a book cafe, with the amount of noise in it, and I've been here more than a couple of times, so if you're looking forward for a quite reading time then you'll be disappointed. The decor is too shiny for a book cafe, and so is the furniture which is pretty uncomfortable, so you can't actually sit for long period of times. But otherwise, they have a huge selection of teas from every part of India. A spectacular place for tea lovers. I personally love the hapjan tea which comes from Assam, so that's definitely a recommendation. And it's not just the indian teas that they have, they've got organic, Chinese variants too. Plus the another list of coffees. I've also tried the bun tiki which was just okay, nothing special about it. If you have a sweet tooth, then the chocolate truffle pastry might not be a bad idea though I found it a little dry and mealy. Overall, always too noisy, so not a book cafe, but a regular little restaurant which specializes in teas not in decent food.",Rated 3.0,75,308,??
Srajan Bhatnagar,"Rated This is the heaven I was looking for. The Cha Bar is a caf located on the outer circle of Delhi's heart. But the fact that it's located right inside the Oxford book shop makes it a better place to visit any day over thousands of other eateries in CP. I went there on a summer afternoon and the caf was almost fully occupied. I ordered one of the varieties of teas on offer ( I don't remember which one exactly). It was nice and served quickly. The new overall ambience of the place will confuse your into thinking that it's gonna make your wallet considerably lighter, but it's quite the value for money place that students can afford with their pocket money. The only thing I disliked was the level of noise in the premises, considering that it's a book cafe. It just won't be possible to read a book in that much noise, which defeats the basic purpose of the place.",Rated 4.0,8,137,??

Shubhangi Dixit,"Rated Cha bar is the kind of place where you go and take a book and just relax, order a sandwich with some tea and go into the world of books. The place is beautifully done, with a theme of white seatings, which makes it very light and lively. The ambiance is nice, and the place is full of readers. I went there to catch up with a friend and look at some of the books. We luckily got a table for 3, since the place was completely full of people. It was dussehra time and the walls were adorned with the festive decoratives. The service, was not so good. The waiters failed to provide us with menus or take orders for at least 20 minutes! Even if they weren't busy, they were not attending to the people. We ordered a cold coffee with ice cream, a hot chocolate, some sandwiches and an aloo wrap. The sandwiches were nothing special, they were something that you make at home and have it in breakfast. The drinks were really good, and provided in great quantities. The wrap was tasty, but the covering was really hard, which made it almost inedible. I wouldn't recommend anyone the wraps, go for the drinks especially. The food was okay-ish, don't keep your expectations too high. But do have the drinks listed on the menu. We also ordered a truffle pastry, which they heated and poured extra hot chocolate syrup. The pastry was extremely soft, which just added to the heavenly taste. It made a great ending to our meal.

Sadish Garg,"Rated This place was on my wishlist since long and I happen to visit it on Dussehra after my office since I got an early off and was craving for a good warm coffee. This place is situated in the building opposite to The Statesman House inside The Oxford Bookstore. It has a not too flashy ambiance with a plain painted wall on one side and a black wallpapered wall on the other side on which hung various handmade paper swords and shields (probably a Dussehra decor). The place was bustling with people when I entered but I managed to find myself a table. They have white marble tables and steel chairs which is a nice change from your usual cafes. Now lets come to their menu. They have a HUMONGOUS variety of teas and coffees and a decent variety of snacks and pastries. Since I was alone, I ordered their Cafe Au Lait and a Bun Omlette. The Cafe Au Lait's had a nice aroma but it was warm and not hot which I would have liked after a tiring day at work. Next came the bun omlette which was exactly what the name says, an omlette in a bun but it was folded really well inside the bun so it wasnt coming out while eating. Service is one thing these guys need to work on as I had to call them for every single thing 1-2 times whether it be menu, my order or bill.

I could see lot of food coming on different tables while i was waiting for mine and it looked delicious with decent portions. My bun tikki n tea came all for Rs 121. And,wow that is some value for money. This place is called a book cafe,though for books you need to buy one from the store..there is no library or collection from which you can borrow for some time to read while enjoying your tea.

I like masala n ginger as they are of typical indian taste tea. But Earl Grey was also nice. We also ordered cottage cheese sandwich n chilli cheese toast. Both are good n not to forget the prices are reasonably low as compared to other cafes in CP. So all gud but small n loud place that is why my rating is 4.",Rated 4.0,27,64,??
Dhrupad Suri,"Rated Cha Bar is like the perfect college hangout place. Set in the outer circle of Connaught Place in Oxford Book Store this place is definitely a show stealer. Ambience Subtle tones of blue with highlights of metal & black makes it look very cosy and welcoming at the same time. Food I ordered for a fish & chips, nice portion and very tasty. Juicy from inside and golden crispy from outside served with the tartare dip. The USP is the tea and my personal favourite is the masala cha. The red velvet cake was average and would suggest not to order the same. The Bun with shammi Kabab is also average. Altogether an above average food experience. Service There were certain highs and lows but found the service staff hassled and confused, provably more coordination needed. Value for Money Pocket friendly and ideal of youngsters who believe in having a good meal without making a hole in their pocket. Altogether a good experience. I'm sure it can be better and this place has that potential to do so. "" Love thy food like never before"" - D",Rated 3.5,113,420,??

Rohan Pratap Singh,"Rated Cha bar is a little conspicuous caf in Connaught Place and it is just beside or with the Oxford Book Store. Cha bar is not exactly the caf you deserve but one you definitely need. Their specialty is teas and if you go there for the first time watch it for the British feel it gives. High roofed ceiling, typical English chairs and TEA of course! They have a huge assortment of teas ranging from normal teas like masala chai and Bollywood masala chai, Darjeeling teas and teas from Assam all have a space in the menu. You can spend hours in this place reading a book from the Oxford bookstore and drinking teas of different sorts. The milk shakes they offer are pretty average thus you would be better off ordering teas. The malai tikka sandwich was tasty but I have had better. Try the Bollywood masala chai and Darjeeling Queens choice. The latter is more ethnic. The service of the place is not the best but due to the small size of the caf it is not a very big issue. A perfect blend of rustic and aristocracy is what defines cha bar the best. Though a little congested it still steals the show in tea cafes.

Each of the teas were rejuvenating and snacks were also good. You can't expect pasta to be really delicious but still I would give it 3 out of 5. Aura is really cozy and you feel like getting immersed in books. A very rare place in Delhi. I've been to this place twice and recommended this place to my friends also, they loved it too.

Swati Bhattacharya,"Rated Cha bar...a perfect place for book lovers..8) it is situated within the Oxford book store..you can choose any of your fav book from the store, buy it and comfortably enjoy it with small snacks and CHAi..:) cha bar offers an immense variety of chai (tea) to choose from..:) The interiors are well done and the place is usually jam packed.. I have been there thrice and was lucky enough to find myself a vacant table.. A nice music played in the background is soothing to the ears..:) So coming to the menu...it mentions a varieeeeety of tea..including ice tea, exotic teas, fruit teas, masala teas..etc phew list is quiiite long.. I have had strawberry milkshake, black current, khus khus sherbet, mango and black current smoothie.. Smoothies and milkshake were nice but too much of ice makes the sherbet a bit diluted especially in taste..:/ From the tea section I have had Bollywood masala tea, passion fruit, black grape and raspberry ice tea.. Well I must mention some of the waiters there seemed a bit inexperienced.. It was a bit tough for me to explain what exactly I wanted to order.. In the end the only option left for me was to show them the name in the menu card to make it clear for them..:/ once I had ordered black grape ice tea and they served black current sherbet instead..:( it was annoying.. Coming to bollywood masala tea..its served in a kettle having a face of some heroine painted on it..and 2 small glasses..the presentation was nice..but i could not taste any masala in the first sip of the chai..I asked them to kindly recheck whether they have added any masala in it..so they took the kettle and brought it again to me and this time it tasted like a masala chai.. The ice teas again seemed diluted bcoz of the ice..it tasted like any other flavoured sherbet.. In eateries, I have had- 1. chicken caeser salad..the quantity was a bit disappointing.. 2. Chicken pasta in white cream sauce...guys its a must try..the flavours are very Indian..this is one particular dish I have ordered twice..:) 3. Bun tikki burger...very disappointing...it had a thin chicken kebab between the burger buns with very little mayo..that is it...no lettuce or any other veggie..oh man it was sooo dry for my mouth..and had no taste..so plz DO NOT try this at all.. 4. Achari chicken wrap...again very Indian..chicken pieces were juicy and the filling between the wrap was spicy and very delicious...it was being served with green chutney..(4.5/5) 5. Chicken shwarma wrap...little in spice..yet tasty..: ) it was served with white mayo and tasted well..(4/5) 6. Chicken Malai tikka with jalapeo sandwitch..(4.5/5) 7. Muffins..blueberry, chocolate and nuts, rum and raisin..a bit dry but tasted fyn..(3.5/5) Hence in total nice place to hang out alone as well as with friends..quite light on pocket and a soothing ambience..:) Some inexperienced waiters, diluted cool drinks were the drawback points..:(",Rated 3.5,21,60,??

Go with a friend or alone, order a basic chai or something adventurous some snippets (samosa sand-witch, bun tikki, bun maska, red velvet pastry, muffins, apple cinnamon pastry) sit back and enjoy the soothing ambiance of the place. The air is filled with music and peaceful chatter coming from the tables. Its almost therapy. A few drawbacks. Small staff, leaves you craving for attention, but they rarely get ur order wrong.

KR,"Rated Cha bar is the best place to be for book lovers. Oxford book store provides the perfect ambience and the variety of books that one might browse ,read,buy etc while visiting cha bar. Knowing my love for books and tea my like minded roommate insisted that I should visit at least once. So here I was with my friend to experience cha bar and I must say I was a tad disappointed. First the positives, I loved the ambience and being surrounded by books. The fact that the place was packed through out the time we were there proves that it is GOOD. We had to wait for 5 mins til we got a place and I used that time to browse through my all time fave - Man Woman and Child by Erich Segal. Once we were seated we ordered for cardamom tea which is 35/- each, Bun kebab @ 80/- and shwarma wrap@100/-. Though we wanted to have sandwiches unfortunately there were none available- all sold out before 7pm!!!! We found the place to be pocket friendly. Once we placed the order, the waiting began. Very disappointed by the service. People came after us ordered after us but ate before us and left before us. After telling multiple waiters abt our order we received the shwarma after 40 mins. It was dry and bland and the Hummus wasn't good either. Next comes the bun kebab and tea after another 15 20 mins. Bun was over heated and hard while the patty didn't taste good. Tea was ok. We had planned to order for some pasta and dessert but we did not want to wait anymore so we called for the bill. And as expected another 15 Mins and no bill. Told 3 diff waiters then finally had to go personally to the counter and ask for it. All in all did not like the service. Will I go back? Hell yes!!

Mostly bustling with the college crowd this place is great for book lovers / the experience I mean. The service is also good and prompt, however there are no real suggestions for the specials in the menu. The food that I ordered was very average - we ordered fries, falafel and a mushroom sandwich.

Being a non-tea person, who till my first visit here hadn't really tasted tea, was a simply marvelous experience. I had first tried their Rose tea, which was a very light flavoured chai, with a gentle aroma which truly soothes your senses. A friend had ordered an organic mint and tulsi chai, which was a bit strong for my taste buds. The ice teas are also quite nice and refreshing. The place has an array of delicious accompaniments like variety of sandwiches, salads, wraps, local savouries like pakoras, samosas, kebabs,etc and ofcourse desserts. The basil pesto and vegatable panini, fish and chips as well as red velvet cake are my usual picks there. The flourless chocolate cake, and carrot and walnut cake are bit too dry, and can be improved upon. The service is quite slow, may be because the place gets too crowded at times.",Rated 4.0,23,26,??

Iced tea's were fine Sandwich was an average for me (samosa filled in grilled bread) and so was the walnut cake (wasn't fresh to me) We ended our meal with their ayurvedic tea - vishudhi which was just apt for me.

Any ways, when I entered, the place was appeared beautiful as its been done in white with side walls in black and outside is a beautifully lit bookstore which adds to its grace. Firstly the place was packed & one might have to wait around a bit to get the chance to sit down (we went there at 3:00 pm). When I looked at the menu, I was so confused looking at such varieties of chai and beverages and even what to eat?! But then we decided on their: 1. Chicken CAESAR's Salad, which was, at first look appeared colourless but tasted good enough to keep on digging in my friend's plate. :P (4\5) 2. Chicken Pasta in white sauce, which was darn delicious and was of the write amount of flavours. (5\5) 3. Strawberry Milkshake, which was a little less then good (my opinion) but quantity was great. (3\5) 4. Khus Sherbet, also good. (4\5) 5. & most important one, I am not at all a tea sipper but was so eager to try out at least one of them big variety of 'chais' so asked the staff there to suggest us something good (as it was our first time there) and we chose BLACKCURRENT Iced tea. Now we asked for the check, and when I read what I got was a BLACK GRAPE sherbet.. And when notified them for this, they said ""sorry sir, it was written sherbet instead of iced tea in our log."" And I'm like what the....happened to the DIFFERENT NAMES of the both drinks. So that was one of the let downs. Any ways, overall it was a good experience, staff was courteous but I guess, there was a little bit of language problem with the waitress we got as she just couldn't understand what did we want in the first go & we had to show it to her on the menu card after the third time of sayin' it out loud (I'm thinking Unexperienced). I couldn't taste a tea in a CHAI BAR. :\ Plus, there was lot of delay in bringing the order. But all these, the little shards of let down, was very much like shrugging it off. Over all it was a great place to hang out and I'm thinking I want to go there again. :) Their rates are just NOT AT ALL HEAVY ON THE WALLET, thats plus one for them! :D P.S.-There is this BOLLYWOOD MASALA TEA, which looks interesting as served in a kettle with faces on it and 2 small glasses.

I had ordered one blackcurrent iced tea which was fine- nothing great.. Fish and chips- they were truly amazing.. Chicken tikka sandwich- I personally didnt like it much but my friend truly loved it!

Abhiram Bidwai,"Rated Books and coffee has always been a great combination. When you add a lot of style, sophistication and professionalism, what you get is a place like Cha Bar. Ambience - Entering the place is such a refreshing experience to your eyes. The cafe is located inside a book store which has been done up in complete white colours. The cafe side is done in blacks. Which adds a lovely contrast and makes you feel walking into a monochrome ambience. The interiors are chic and minimal. I went in the morning, the place was naturally lit and looked kickass. Full marks there. Go for the masala chai and toast. Ah! Service is efficient. Damage - 300/head Will I visit again? - No. abhirambidwai.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Poushali Dasgupta,"Rated Cha Bar is Nirvana for Tea Lovers.Centrally Located in Delhi, it attracts a lot of Young crowd. Though, it is very difficult to Locate as it is inside the Very Famous Oxford Bookstore in CP. It has a very Modern Design and outlook. Besides a Wide Variety of Tea species From Assam to China to Mexico, they serve delicious snacks too. The Non- Vegetarian platter is Okay. The only better part of the platter is the sausage. They have a very greasy mutton samosa and chicken wings served in the platter which makes it all very heavy for an evening snack. The Wraps are Moderately delicious but the cold-coffee is something to look for. The best part of this Cafe is that they serve tea in very beautifully designed Glasses that make the tea look very palatable.",Rated 2.5,16,22,??
Sukhmani Sakhi,"Rated A pretty exciting place to walk into! Combining the love for books and food, kudos to that! Conceptually a smart little cafe set amidst a sultry bookstore, Cha Bar certainly attracts a curious eye. Ambience: straight, to the point kind of a cafe. Done up in basic colors of blue and white. Small white tables and chairs, very basic again. The cafe area is a bit crammed up since it's overfilled with the bustle of enthusiastic delhiites. The fact that it is set in the middle of a book store lends a special rustic feel to the whole culinary experience. Service: the waiters seemed a bit offbeat. They mixed up our order more than once, brought the same dish thrice to the table and mistook a few orders! Pay attention much? The chai took the longest to arrive. Ordered first and received last, almost at the end of a one hour meal. Food: The menu is definitely elaborate encompassing almost all the essential ""chai"" snacks. There is a decent range of teas that they offer and then there is of course the lovely array of savouries. We ordered a lot of food out of which most was disappointing since this place seemed pretty kickass and raised my expectations. The baked samosa was pretty good, non greasy and flavourful. Keema samosa was passable, could have been better. The onion bhajiyas were oily and bland. I mean how can one go wrong with these? Absolutely poor on taste. The mint paneer sandwich and the shammi kebab sandwich with caramelised onions, both were good. The cha-toast was basically butter lathered bread which was pretty awesome. I mean butter bread can't be un-awesome. The bun tikki was another let down. No seasoning or sauce in it. Bland again. The smoked chicken sandwich with mustard, served cold and was delicious. The red velvet cake was just ridiculous. Walnut carrot cake, not so bad. The masala chai and the hot coffee was pretty good. Go to this place for the ambience, the books and the chai! Food is average and service isn't too efficient either. Cost/person : Rs. 250 Will I visit again? Yes, conditions apply*",Rated 3.0,136,1168,??

Anubhav Jha,"Rated This Saturday was my first ever visit to the Cha Bar at Connaught Place. This is located at N Block in CP, right opposite Statesman building (where it was present earlier). The restaurant name truly does justice to the lovely world of teas. They have a lot of varieties of teas. I am not too big a fan of the traditional tea, but do not mind having black or green teas every now and then. I tried the passion fruit hot tea and it tasted rather different in a good way and was quite refreshing. The chicken sandwich that we ordered was served with fries and had 4 pieces neatly cut and presented to us. A friend of mine ordered the masala tea which was although less in quantity, but he said that the tea was highly effective and had a strong taste. (Meant to be a compliment) Although the place was crowded, it being a weekend during the peak lunch hours, but still, we were able to find a spot for the three of us within 15 minutes. The price of the place is very much affordable and is in fact cheaper than the Baristas and the Costas of Delhi.

Only problem is that the small cafe is very overcrowded. First you have to wait to find a table, then its very noisy. Because of the great rush, the service is also poor. I ordered cardamom tea, and I like my tea very hot, but I was served a lukewarm tea. The sandwich was good but nothing extraordinary. However, they serve you tea in their trademark 'glassy' which is very appealing. Its a different experience altogether to drink tea in those glasses. Best part about this cafe is that its very easy on your pockets. And you get to see pretty nerdy faces also in the cafe. So I would love to go to this place again and again.",Rated 4.0,23,202,??
Rohini Gauba,"Rated A small cafe among bigger racks of books..This is what Cha Bar is all about. The place obviously does not have much seating space and I went there on a Sunday for a quick grab, so you could imagine the hustle and bustle with kids running down the aisle's, people chit-chatting loudly and some sitting with a mug of coffee/chai, trying to look through their recent Oxford purchase. The marble-top tables with a fresh flower kept in the middle, sets up your expectations. We ordered, a spiced cappuccino, a khus sherbat and basil, pesto veges sandwich. Spiced Cappuccino- Very strong flavours of cinnamon but very mild flavours of actual coffee. Overall, at par with the price. A big mug of cappuccino for 50 bucks was a good deal. Khus Sherbat- Served in a tall glass, the green coloured sherbat tasted nothing like khus. They certainly needed to add more khus essence and flavouring. Sandwich- 4 pieces of nicely grilled sandwiches, filled with zucchini, carrots, basil leaves and pesto sauce. A handful of french fries were served along. The sandwiches were filling and crunchy, just the way I would have liked it to be.

Amit Rawat,"Rated Book cafes are a new concept in India. And Cha Bar proves how successful and popular such cafes can be. Located near the Statesman Building inside the Oxford Bookstore, this joint is all things chic. Usually crowded the cafe serves a number of different teas with funny names (Bollywood Chai; Truck Driver) in equally creative cups and glasses. The food is above average and the menu has a lot of variety. Fish and Chips are to die for as well as limited in amount. The seating arrangement is a bit cramped. Also, a book cafe is supposed to be a place wherein you can comfortably read a book. But due to the jam-packed crowd, the cafe is just too much noisy to a read a book at. The other USP of this place is the cost. It is cheaper for the quality of time one can have here.

The first impression was great as the ambience and interiors were brilliant and great spatial sense and arrangement of tables. Though a company for more than 3 may have a hard time adjusting to sit together on tiny tables. The pricing is decent but ambience and pricing are the only 2 good things saving grace of the place. The food is ok ok , one could rather go to a better place to have decent food than eating here an experimenting on ""not so fresh"" ,""not so Tasty"" food . I tried different type of tea's for which it is actually famous out of which Many were DISSAPPOINTING.... Masala chai had an overpowering taste of anjeer and other ""masala"" which made it TASTE LIKE MITHAI. English tea , green tea and chamomile tea were good and a few other were not even worth a mention. The cappuccino was good , so was the cafe latte. Also please DO NOT ORDER the thandai as it tastes overly sweet and again the taste of anjeer and saunf is too overpowering. STAFF IS RUDE , especially the one waiter from the north east.

The menu has a wide variety of bites to offer apart from loads of options in the beverage section. We ordered a chicken wrap and a chicken white sauce penne pasta.

The blackcurrant was sorta odd and a little on the too sweet side.The mint tea was nice and refreshing Food: Fish n chips was really tasty . The fish was fresh and crispy and so were the fries. Sadly they served it with ketchup and even though I asked for tartar , I didn't get any. The kebab rolls with hummus was really tasty and the hummus was well made The portions were big enough to fill our stomach and small enough to not make us feel heavy and overfull. Ambience: The decor is really well done and the books reading space is a good idea. But it's really really noisy . I dont know if its because of the small space or the type of walls but I couldn't even hear my friend sitting on the table. That was rather disappointing Service: The service was good enough considering how there were only two or three servers. Price: This was the best part.

Manav Garg,"Rated Happened to visit the place while I was stranded in Delhi for a few hours. The cafe is typically fast paced. I stayed in from about 6 PM to 8 PM. The evenings meant a lot of noise, and a small wait to get a seat inside. There were small groups of people on most tables, with considerable amount of noise. Not the ideal place for someone who wants a silent cup of tea. The things went on to change as it turned late. As people moved out, the place turned a lot more peaceful. The chai. The menu surprises you. You're confused for more than just a while. There is an endless variety available. Most flavours are not too strong. On most days (and as a lot of reviews have mentioned), they are very similar to boiled water, but for the colour of the drink. For someone who does enjoy tea however, the little flavour will probably be enough. I tried peppermint and rum from the Flavoured section, and found both products satisfactory. The food. The nachos were out of stock, and had to settle for the Chilly Cheese Toast. The serving was good in size (for the cost).

I turned the pages and looked at the right side of the menu (prices)...so damn affordable was the first thing that crossed my mind. I ordered a truck driver wala chai that had kali mirch in it...and it was yummy indeed (its only now that you realize that for Rs 35, that seemed so less earlier, you only get a small glass). The glass holder was interesting piece of metal art though. After a lot of pondering, I ordered a veg platter but to my utter dismay it wasn't available. I had to settle in for grilled sandwich with fries and that was awesome too. It was time for me to rush home so I asked for a chhole wrap to be packed. I paid the bill and left, promising myself that I would come here more often - not alone but with friends and family. The food is exceptional. I wish they had warmed the wrap a little more though for it had turned cold by the time I reached my car in the parking and nibbled the first bite off it. Not to forget the small glass...quality is way beyond excellent and makes up for the quantity but.",Rated 4.0,10,65,??

They are categorised in lists which help you decide the tea you want according to your mood and liking. I have been here umpteen times and always return for more. the teas are all served in interesting cups and mugs. The bollywood chai is served in a kettle painted with bollywood posters and poured in small cutting chai glasses. they have Everything from a Pomegranate tea to Kashmiri Kahwa. The service is prompt and they are some delicious cakes, sandwiches and pastas to go along with your tea. The flourless chocolate cake is my favorite, pastas too are decent. but usually i just go here for the teas after meal around the area. it is located inside the oxford bookstore so if are a book lover this is a double whammy for you.

Suvansh Srivastava,Rated Well probably I went to Cha Bar on a bad day but my experience was not as good as I had expected and heard of. Warning: this place is for reading books and hanging out rather than for eating. Food &beverage: most disappointing fact was that most of the stuff on the elaborate menu was not available in food items. But the tea and coffee menu was just too elaborate. If anyone is into tea and coffee one must visit this place. And all tea and coffee varieties were available. But dont expect to get much to eat as they wouldn't have much available (although menu is well populated) Service: I must say of all the restaurants of this status I experienced the worst service. The restaurant was seriously understaffed. I even thought it is a self service kinds. But they said the waiter would take the order. The two poor souls who were waiting tables were so engrossed in the eyes of the few customers they were serving at a time that it took us about 20minutes to grab their attention. Then we got lucky (after almost shouting for the waiter) to place our order. One tea variety and two coffee varieties plus something to munch. (Most food item was not available and it was 5.30 in the evening). The waiter came back after another yell and delivered the munchies and tea. We waited for the coffee to arrive a little later. But it never did. We waited for about 45min (and reminded the waiter once) but got nothing. So we paid and left while the waiter was requesting just 5 more minutes. The place is too upmarket may be thats why it has got a very good rating but for me it was one of the worst experiences.

I went there along with two of my very good friends. Our order was chicken sausages, cheese toast and a vegetarian platter. The service is fast as I don't remember consoling my starving stomach. The food is good value for money and very well priced. We were a little surprised though when we weren't allowed to order anything from the 'kids menu' though.

The very selection on the menu is classy yet homely with pot pies and oodles and oodles of teas from various corners of the world. I've had fish and chips here which was nice, fresh n soft. The chicken wings with a very good helping were unfortunately too oily for my taste. The pepper tandoori paneer tikka was huge and heavy, but tasty. My favourites perhaps were the huge helpings of crispy fries and the 100 mile truck driver cha (which I may say is now my favourite in the whole world with its clove and elaichi flavours!) To top it off, Chinese tea (unfortunately I've forgotten the name souchong something) is very soothing. Extra marks for the tea pots and tea cup used. It was extremely beautiful!",Rated 4.0,22,40,??

Ankush Mohanty,"Rated Tiny but still not cramped. Very economical but still not cheap quality. Once located at the Statesman House, Cha Bar has come to CPs outer circle and thank God, it has. It was the very first time that I visited this place and trust me, I rued this particular aspect of my visit. This place offers the perfect setting for an avid reader and a foodie as well. Bright lights are the key here making you feel as if you are right in the middle of a concert. Right next to the seating area is a book shop, Oxford Book Store and I need not tell you on how can one kill time here. The menu consists of numerous options of tea, hot and as well as cold, and some very simple yet flavorsome options for food also. Around 60% of the menu has various types of tea from different parts of the country. They offer the food which gels well with tea and snacks combo such as samosas, bun maska, samosa sandwich, patties and other varieties as well. One word of caution, they purposefully do not stock high quantities of sandwiches, samosas, pastries etc as they believe in keeping it fresh. So reach there on time and order at the earliest. We tried the omelette burger and thyme flavored mushroom and potato sandwich with Nilgiri tea and blueberry flavored iced tea. It turned out to be a masala omelette and it was good enough to give the tea drinker food for thought. The thyme flavored mushroom and potatoes was simply great. It had the flavours which were promised. The bread that used was multi grain and it also added to the taste. One of the items that I wanted to have was the egg Kasundi sandwich but unfortunately they were out of it till I decided to give it a go. Kasundi as we know is the typical Bengali mustard sauce which is known for its fieriness. I am assuming that it would complement brilliantly with the egg and the bread but I shall have to come again. The day we had gone there was a recitation of Rabrindranath Tagores poems in Bengali, no wonder the egg Kasundi was out of stock! And the USP of the place, all this and the bill came out to be 335 INR. Yes, the place offers the real value for money here.",Rated 3.5,103,370,??

Isha Saxena,"Rated After reading lovely reviews about this place, I was quite excited to visit the book cafe and on a hot afternoon, after a tedious walk, we spotted the Cha Bar! We entered the Oxford Bookstore- paradise for a bibliomaniac- on the right is the still and calm bookstore, with a back room, where readers can enjoy their books and on the left, is effervescent Cha Bar, full of chirpy friends, laughs, chortles, people working and grabbing a quickie. With white marble table-tops, white iron chairs, blue doorways leading to the bookstore, the enthralling light fixtures, the signature flower on table and servers rushing through the place to take orders. From their extensive tea collection, we ordered a cardamom chai, a bollywood masala chai and a cappuccino; a chicken pot pie, a chicken and hoisin sauce wrap, a portion of fish and chips and a smoked chicken and celery club sandwich. The order took longer than we thought it would. They really know their work, the beverages were marvelous. The kettle that the bollywood masala chai comes in is as charming as the chai itself. Although the cardamom tea in the jumpy monkey was splendid, and I liked that better! :) The food and flavours were just as incredible as the ambiance. The wrap was good enough, amusingly so one half better dressed than the other- the chicken fresh and nicely wrapped in piquant flavours! The chicken pot pie, stuffed with smoked chicken pieces was ambrosial. The crust on the potpie was freshly baked and tasted just heavenly! The club sandwich was enticing- tempting grilled bread served with fries which were a tad bit too cold :O But the sandwich was gratifying, soft egg on the top layer with the luscious chicken <3 The fish and chips were my favourite of the lot which came in with piping hot fries, so it made up for the cold ones that came with the club sandwich. The fish was super fresh and simply scrumptious. The place is wonderfully light on the pocket! A must try- fish and chips, the celery club sandwich and of course, the chai! :) chompslurrpburp.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

They serve too many different types of teas and other beverages for anyone to try out all of them. But what ever you do try, you will like. For me, an average meal there consists of a Truck driver chai with chilli cheese toast. The chai is flavoured with black pepper and ginger which really gives you a solid kick. The chilli cheese toast is nice. Then I move on to their Penne Arabiatta Pasta, which is, in one worn, awesome and their bun tikki, which is good as well. The desserts are nice as well though nothing to rave about. The Red Velvet cake and the Pineapple Pastry are good.

Nisshant Aggarwal,"Rated After recommended by N number of people finally visited the infamous Cha Bar. Ambience: This place is attached to the Oxford Book Store. Since it adjoins a bookstore I was expecting a bit of silence but the place was crowded and noisy. AMAZING BOOKSTORE I must say. Well lit cafe with large chandeliers over the top. (4/5) Food and Tea: A huge variety of tea present in their menu. Ordered for a Jasmine, Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry and Nilgiri teas. The presentation of the teas were really good. The Jasmine tea had amazing aroma and Strawberry was quite tasty. Nilgiri tea tasted more or less like green tea and the Vanilla was average. Ordered for white sauce pasta and sandwich. Both were nice(not very good though) Verdict: Amazing bookstore, Huge collection of tea and tasty snacks. Very very reasonable too.",Rated 4.5,126,801,??

Somya Tuteja,"Rated Cha Bar was in my wishlist for months before a reunion with my school's best friend took me here about a month back. Both of us being fans of good literature, felt like this place, which is located in the oxford book store, is heaven on earth. She had been here a few times before, and as soon as she suggested it, It got me all jumping with joy. Its located in the N block, outer circle of CP on first floor. Its not exactly inside the bookstore, its entrance is through the book store. Anyways we reached we were told on the gate that there was no electricity and many items weren't available. we were disappointed, but still went ahead. As we grabbed a table along the wall, i started to admire its white and black walls which is contrasted by the big black chandelier.The table were of marbles and gave a soothing feeling. The TV on the other end of the walls showed the pictures of events in the bookstore. there were beautiful small paintings beside me and as i admired through them, i found that many were for sale. The crowd was mostly philosophical type, had a mixed bag of youngsters to aunties. Anyways, the menu the waiter gave us was old and tattered and had its pages coming out. i wish they renew the menus. after a long debate we finally ordered, i ordered a rose sharbat and a red sauce pasta. My friend ordered a cappuccino and a chicken mud pie. we also ordered a red velvet cake. Later we also ordered a carrot cake. The food took a bit of time, we werent surprised as the place was nearly full. red sauce pasta: It was penne. It was garnished by something white, which i couldn't pin point what it was but it was yummy. The sauce was of right quantity but the veggies were completely missing. Sharbat: it was yummy, perfectly sweet and cold. chicken mud pie: it was a round fried thing with fillings of chicken inside, i didn't taste it, but my friend loved it! Cappuccino : Extremely nice, neither too strong nor too milky! but it was too much for an average person. Red velvet cake: the best thing about the day. It was yummy to the core, perfectly melted in the mouth. had me wanting more. carrot cake: It was soft and perfectly sweet. overall- ambiance- 5/5 , this is what people come here for. food -3.5/5 somethings are yummy, some above average. Service:3/5 its slow, some waiters are nice, some are slow. price: 5/5 after ordering 6 dishes, our total bill came out to be 484. which is super cheap. portions: 2.5/5 average.

Vinayak Kumar,"Rated Beautiful place. Browse through books and then sit down with one in a bar. The acoustics have ensured that the place is always noisy (which is a disadvantage if you're reading serious stuff). But for Chetan Bhagat level writing, its a great place to sit down and have your fill.. They have a wide selection of teas (Ceylon) being my personal favourite along with Truck Wala Chai. Fish & Chips are actually quite good while their Chicken Patties and Muffins are excellent. Avoid the CCD's and the Starbucks and give this a try.

But the dissapointment started as soon as we got our food. One of my friend had ordered Hindustani Chai which she didnt like at all.. the chicken quiche was very dry so was the chicken pot pie..the french fries were okay... and the raspberry iced tea was good, thirst quenching.. that was the only great thing in the entire meal.

SincerelyKangna,"Rated After hearing so much good about the place from so many people I had to pay my visit to CHA BAR. This place is located in CP's outer circle in N block in Oxford book store. Entire place is very beautifully done, I really like its decor, it is so amazing that I fail to describe it with adjectives but I will strongly recommend it to all the readers, to take time off from your busy schedule and pay a visit. All you need to do is to take a book from the book store, grab a seat at cha bar and sip away your tea. About Food: Their menu is very nicely done, with over 100+ types of teas available to try from. They have a lot of good options in eating too. One must try: apple muffin and veg sandwiches. Ice tea served here is really good to kill Delhi heat in summers, I really enjoyed their peppermint tea. The flavors added to the drink will hit you nicely. Nothing seems over done. About Ambience: Walls are done in pitch dark black color and with two huge black chandeliers falling from the ceiling, add a lot to the whole ambiance. I visited this place during morning for a quick brunch, but I think it will look equally beautiful during night or evening too. Tables are marble made and chairs are cute tiny. Place looked little small to me, I doubt if they can accommodate large gang of people. But the whole place is very nicely done and maintained. I really enjoyed visiting it, it was very my type. I wish I could decorate some corner or section in my home like they decorated their place with so much care. About Crowd and Staff : This place for youth, they can spend hours here. But I wont mind visiting it with my parents either over a cup of tea, provided they have a taste for such places. Staff is very soft spoken and sweet to talk to. The mugs and the kettles they use to serve tea/coffee looks very custom made and is very stylish. I really want to congratulate the management of the Oxford book store and char bar for bringing up with this concept of clubbing a chai place next to a book store and then maintaining it so well. They have just one such store in entire Delhi, must open more. This place is very urban and must deserves a re visit.

Aditya Goel,"Rated Cha Bar- located in the Oxford Bookstore in N-Block, Connaught Place is in fact as popularly advertised every bibliophile and foodies dream place. The Tea aficionado in me was jumping with excitement that finally itll get to visit a place dedicated to just tea besides my mothers kitchen. I had to deposit my bag at the entry mainly because of the bookstore; we entered and were absolutely delighted by the dcor and the ambience. The place was packed at 7 PM but the waiting time was less than 10 minutes. The tables were made of marble, adorned with a flower on each table, sturdy, stable as well as soothing to ones eyes. I felt that once you have your order on the table it gets congested. They were absolutely under-staffed on the day as I could see only 2 persons serving around 15-16 tables. Nonetheless, the staff was courteous, well-learned and had good recommendations on their hands. Fish and chips were nicely done, although I was expecting Potato wedges with them instead of Fries. The Paneer Wrap was also palatable with a subtle smoky flavour and ingredients that gel together well. On the tea roster were Raspberry Ice Tea, Lemon Zest Ice Tea and Kashmiri Kahwa. Raspberry Ice tea is a must try in the cold beverages, lemon zest I felt was a bit too sweet. The presentation of Kahwa was more than one could ask for. Served in traditional utensils, The Kahwa is spot on when it comes to taste and flavor. I would recommend using just a single sugar pack but to each their own. Final Verdict: A little caf specializing in tea with a wide yet simple array of food choices troubled by a serious shortage of staff. Thank you for your time. Cheers and Happy Eating.",Rated 3.5,29,337,??

Perfect home-made taste it had.5/5 Bun Tikki - A small Aloo Patty sandwiched in a Small Bun with Black Sesame seeds served with Ketchup. 3/5 as It was lil' uncooked as I felt.

Sakshi Emm,"Rated If you are Bibliophile, you will end up behaving like a kid at candy store, when at Oxford. The colorful dcor, kitschy knick knacks and numerous bookshelves warm the cockles of my heart. The Cha Bar just a few steps away only adds to the exclusivity of this bookstore. The caf serves a wide variety of teas and savories and you can also work or read a book while munching on some snacks. I went here on a lazy winter afternoon with a friend. As it was his first visit to Oxford and he is not a Book person, I was skeptic whether he will enjoy. But, he discovered a new found love for graphic novels at Oxford. *Yay* We retired to Cha Bar after raiding the Bookstore. The dcor here is minimalist yet elegant. The marble tables are soothing to the eye and concept of placing a flower in marble dish at each table, is refreshingly different. From the vast menu, we settled for a Laccha Paratha Roll with Paneer filling, Cottage Cheese grilled Sandwich, Lime & lemon zest, Grape Cooler, Red Sauce Pasta and Rum Tea. The Roll was delicious and the filling was soft and flavorful. I loved it how they didn't coat the Roll or the filling with excess oil. The Rolls were served with Mint chutney and raw salad. The Sandwich was not so good as the bread was Dry and the Paneer filling was low on salt. The sandwich platter had a ketchup dip and a few French fries. The Pasta was the pretty much standard Red sauce Pasta that you get just about everywhere in the city. What I did miss, was the absence of Garlic Bread with Pasta! :( I did not like the Grape Cooler for some reason but, the Lemon Zest one cooler was relishing. The Rum tea was more or less like Green tea with a very faint after-taste of Rum. The presentation was beautiful but It didn't do any justice to its name. The food and drinks are good for a caf and anyone who likes the combination of food and books, should visit this place at least once. You can buy your favorite books at Oxford then walk over to Cha Bar and treat yourself to good food, without burning a hole in pocket.",Rated 3.5,68,381,??

Vandita_Roaming Gastronaut,"Rated The definition of a good caf is good coffee (or chai in this case) and a great collection of books. This caf totally nails the latter part. Why, because it is a part of the Oxford Bookstore that houses hundreds of books from numerous genres. Add to it, the lively colors of various books, the shelves, the paintings and cute paper craft items that adorn the place. They have utilized the limited space very well by placing a number of small tables. It might get crowded if you order too many things but it does work out. Tea is their specialty, no points for guessing that!!..they have over hundred varieties of tea of various kinds- green, herbal, ayurvedic, masala etc. You would feel totally lost while trying to decide which one to order!...They have good list of food options as well, but they were out of most of the desserts on the menu, at least on the Saturday that I visited. We ordered Bollywood masala chai, masala chai, truck driver 100 mile ki chai, fish & chips, chicken lollipops and out of the very few desserts that were available, we chose to have the English tea cake. All the tea were kadak. The kind that we needed after a tiring shopping session at CP. I loved how balanced all the flavors were and to my delight, they werent overly sweet. Although, one of my friends who likes her tea sweet, felt that the sugar content was low. But the rest two of us were pretty happy with the faint sweetness of the tea. The truck driver 100 mile ki chai was stronger with a strong hint of clove and ginger. It can wake up an aching body, the name was totally apt for this tea. The bollywood masala chai is served in an awesome painted kettle with Bobbys Dimple Kapadia painted on it and with a cute little cutting glass. After I was done with the bollywood masal chai, I ordered a glass of cutting chai as well. I am quite inclined towards tea and coffee, as you would have noticed from my reviews! .There was just put off about the tea, none of these were hot. They were all lukewarm and we all know that reheating tea means totally taking away its flavor and crispness, so we didnt ask them to heat the tea. The English tea cake turned out to be an amazing choice. Its sweetness complimented the low-on-sugar tea. It had a lovely fruity aroma and was so soft. The snacks, though, were very disappointing. The fish & chips were very oily and the fish fillet was so small that we could hardly taste it. The fries, again, were oily. One of the worst fish & chips I have had. The chicken lollipops had a dry crust, they didnt taste fresh and the chicken had no flavor. They tasted a bit better with the green chutney but were totally abysmal without it! roaminggastronaut.wordpress.com",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Puhoop Agarwal,"Rated I have been out of Delhi for a while but when I came back Cha Bar was on my list. I remembered the place that foodie book lovers dream of, a cafe cum bookstore, where one could go and spend time alone or with a friend. But the food back then was extremely good and made the effort worth it. Now however Cha Bar is not the same. Unfortunately I was too enthusiastic and took a friend along. The place and the ambiance have completely changed. This is forgivable but the food has changed tremendously and its definitely for the worse. I ordered a simple enough assorted fries with dip and 2 iced teas. One of these was raspberry and the other was lemon zest. The tea's were all right but the fries were a complete waste of money. The onion rings were missing instead there were smileys which i associate with a kids b'day party and the wedges had no flavor. The dip was the worst. I distinctly remember fries were served with a sour cream dip earlier but now however they were served with salsa. I am all for experimenting but eating a chunky salsa with thin fries was quite a challenge. I understand they have drastically changed the positioning of the cafe to fast food for youngsters that is cheap but unappetizing. However this review comes as a rider. I used to love cha bar earlier and went with huge expectations. If u need an ordinary place that is light on the pocket and serves decent food please go there you. I'm sure you wont feel as disappointed as me.",Rated 3.0,11,173,??

Even the cha bar blend coffee was also great. And not to forget the red velvet pastry was really added cherry on the cake. On our next visit it was almost the lunch time So we ordered chicken pot pie which was in the light lunch menu the only dish that I have disliked in the entire menu till now. Chicken was stale and really very hard to chew. It was because it was refrigerated or may be freezed and then was microwaved. Really bad taste in my mouth. We also ordered blueberry smoothie which was moderately good. All in all a great place to hang out with your friends over a cup of tea or coffee.",Rated 4.5,60,391,??
Divya Arya,"Rated If you're looking for a new place that serves all kinds of tea and a little variety of coffee, this is the place for you. They serve so many varieties of tea, names you wouldn't have ever heard but all of them sound tempting. The food 3.5/5 I had the samosa sandwich and the chana frankie wrap. The samosa sandwich is a very innovative dish, something you wouldn't find elsewhere and its tasty too. The chana frankie too tasted great but not as good as the sandwich. There's a lot of variety when it comes to food, and many of them quite creative. The beverages 3/5 I had the bollywood masala chai which didn't impress me too much. It was almost like a regular homemade chai and I didn't quite feel the taste of either the masala or the sugar, as I said, it was just a regular tea. After the meal, I managed to try the cold coffee too, since there were so many options on the menu and I wanted to try another one. Again I didn't quite like the cold coffee. I had asked for extra chocolate flavour in the coffee, but they didn't put enough of it. So the most disappointing thing was the tea and the cold coffee, which are actually their specialty. The ambiance 3.5/5 You enter into a world of books and somewhere inside you find this little cafe, feels like one of those harry potter movies. The service 2.5/5 Well, the service was pretty bad.

Sia Nakra,"Rated Ah! I do not know why am I rating Cha Bar today! Inspite of it being my persona favorite. So Cha Bar is what I love everything about. The special list and variety of Cha/Chai/Tea they have got is worth it. Well it really confused me and my friends once and we ordered some Tea which was more of a ""Jaributti walaa Kadaa"" .So be careful a little and do not get too excited on seeing such a long list of Tea in the menu. Otherwise if in Conn aught place or a neighboring point or want to skim through a good collection of books drop in at Oxford bookstore and browse through the variety of books they have.Post that for a quick bite or two sit at CHA BAR! Well it does not only have Tea but Yes that is the KEY attraction/USP they have. My personal favorite Combo: Cutting CHA+ Thyme Gallete Sandwich(Mushroom) These grilled sandwiches with a cup of tea can satisfy a hungry stomach in the lurch of food and trying to spot some respite. There are some paneer grilled sandwiches with green chutney which are also good but not great/. I hated the Tuna Grilled Sandwiches they had as they were awfully Bland and the taste was just not what would have agreed to hungry people. Their bakery stuff like their cakes and muffins are good. They recommend the Samosa Sandwich.I found it like a pure acidity propellent.Hated it as a matter of fact.Though Cha Bar Regulars love it(Many not All) Their Cold Coffee is good and nicely whipped up.Their Assorted basket which has Chilli and Pyaaz pakoda,Paneer Tikka and stuff is really not worth a try.Try it only in case you want a Fried Basket of Snacks. Their snacks like the Smilies,French Fries and related snacks are delicious and worth eating even if it is fried.Now I am contradicting about what I said in the last line.However for you perfect fried snacks could be what I mentioned above and for me I am happy with what I just mentioned as far as fried is concerned. The only reason I did not rate Cha Bar as Insane-5.0 was because they run out of stuff very fast.Some items will get over by afternoon and then you just cannot get it!

The place was jam packed and a little congested . The interior is really good going in accordance with the oxford store . And as Indicated by the name they have a wide variety of cha. Lets face it the food is not that great . We odered a black current, mixed fruit, lemon n lime, passion fruit ice tea, the famous masala cha and chips and dips . Masala cha was soothing and mixed fruit ice tea was refreshing...rest of the things were nothing special. Service was really flustered ..the chips n dips platter according to the menu was to have french fries, onion rings and potato wedges..but instead of onion rings we were served potato smiles...when asked about it to the waiter he had no answer whatsoever nor was he concerned.

Prashansa Choudhary,"Rated Definitely a great place to go for a tea! Cha Bar will obviously fascinate Tea Lovers as they can get upto 40 varieties of Tea(mainly unusual ones) here at reasonable prices. As I entered, I was totally mesmerised by outlet's decor. the white colour gave it a very Heavenly and elegant look. Spacious , can accommodate around 30-40 people. It has an open kitchen and of course the whole book store right next to the dinning. Being a tea bar they offer a huge variety of strong as well as subtle drinks. The snacks and desserts are also worth trying. But every coin has two sides. Sadly service is the other side that needs serious help. The staff is way too shy to help you with your orders. Services are very slow. I waited almost 15-20 Minutes for my order of a Bollywood masala tea and chilli cheese toasties. To my surprise the 'cha' served was luke warm not hot as it should be. Although I didn't enjoy This 'cha bar experience' , I will be going someday again to try some other offerings. P.s. I have given 3 stars only for the decor and the variety the have. The taste and service sections haven't impressed me.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

They made us wait for 30 min after which we asked one of the waiters about our order and he told us that he forgot to take it. We had to wait for another 15 min after which they only served us with drinks. After waiting for so long we were told that pasta is not available because their food van didn't come. So basically they served everyone stale food that day. It was a very bad idea to talk to the manager about this incident because he was not at all interested in helping us.

Devikakaushal,Rated WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Avoid this place its not worth your time and money. I went with my friends and its such a big disappointment. The decor is brillant and you will start love ambience but the service is horrible. We ordered 4 dishes and 3 drinks after giving 2 remainders for our order and waiting for 45 mins we get to know that our order was never sent to the kitchen. Adding to this after waiting for another 10 mins we are informed that they are all out of white sauce. we asked them to change our pasta to red sauce. Again after waiting for around 15 mins they serve us just one pasta which you can easily make out is prepared using all the leftover sauces they had. When we asked for our second pasta we told thats all they got and since their food van didnt come today they have nothing to serve. Thats is when we realised all the food that we were served were stale and yesterday's produce. The manager was not at all applogetic. He just didnt accept his fault. Finally when we asked for our bill which came within 30 seconds.. We were charged for items we didnt even order.The whole management is very poor and you must avoid this place.,Rated 1.0,1,0,??

The Oxford book store entrance will make you really happy, specially book and coffee/tea lovers like me. I was impressed with the menu, various tea's and lot of food options. You can go ahead with a regular mug of coffee however I would recommend to try different types of ""Cha's"" available. I chose cardmom tea with veg platter, egg omelette burger and red velvet cake. The tea was plesent but not at all happy with cake..It was stale! Veg platter was pretty desi, bunch of onion pakora, samosa and grilled paneer peice with green chutney unlike it sounded in menu.

I always loved the idea of CCD and Star buck, because u can spend a good time with ur loved one that to a minimum cost. the USP of such places is good crowd. If you like such cafes + if you like tea, then Cha Bar is a place to be. Located on first floor in N block in CP, its is difficult to find bcoz it is not a seperate restaurant but its part of a book store. So u might find it a bit difficult. The menu here is just full of chais. Their is chai of every possible kind. I suck to my fav i.e. ginger tea (35 Bucks !!) and my gal took regular masala chai. We also ordered Samavosa Sandwhich and Bhurji Toast. All items were as expected i.e. chai was hot and kadak and snacks were tasty. Staff is cordial. Ambience is just perfect. The way they serve Chai is quite unique, its in monkey shape cup holders :P. This place is very quite, cost effective and excellent alternative to coffee cafes( which are usually crowded).

The menu is reasonably priced and is perfect for a quick meal on-the-go. They've got an exhaustive beverage menu with a varied range of hot and cold teas. I personally love their Smoked Chicken Caesar Salad that comes loaded with Parmesan shavings. It isn't really authentic but yea, it tastes good!

Arpita Saluja,"Rated My first experience at Cha bar had been quite nice which made me go again there. However today's experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. I mean literally. When we arrived, the place was quite full as expected but we were able to find a table. The place looked to be in the Valentines Day mood with flowers on our table( which I did not notice last time), pretty hearts hanging on the windows and staff wearing small hearts on their clothes as well. It seemed that we were in for a good time, however that was not meant to be. The service was slow as usual. Despite repeated attempts no body came to take our order for full 20 minutes while many people who came after us got theirs. We ordered for: -Cold coffee with Ice cream : Delicious -Ginger tea and masala tea: There was way too much milk and the fancy/quirky holders they provide are good to look at but m not sure how useful they are.. Last time the grip was too weak with the glass almost falling off from it and today there was tea leaking from it.. :/ -Penne pasta with mixed sauce: Very very small portion and way too bland. Even my young brother can make better pasta than the one we had -Cheesy Toasties: a bit burnt and no flavour After having a pretty disappointing experience we ordered Chicken lollipops..(Hey who could go wrong with chicken lollipops I convinced my friends) But Alas it turned out to be the WORST dish. All I could taste was Oil.. there was nothing appetizing about the dish..To save the dish we asked two different waiters to get us some ketchup but they paid no heed to our request. Finally after waiting for 15 minutes we decided to leave and asked for the bill (which was promptly given to us by the same waiter) The whole incident really spoiled the evening for us... One more things to note: -There was a group of young college students who got up from the table and started promoting their poetry festival scheduled for the next day in the cafe. Though I agree that there are some people do not want to be disturbed by such gimmicks while enjoying coffee with their dear ones, but that was not the case today. The people in the cafe did cheer them and went along with the whole thing BUT it was the cafe owners who deliberately turned up the Volume of the background music to drown their voices... I don't know it was little petty I feel. Overall not a very good experience and I will rate this place 1/5 only for the ambience.

Nikhil Chawla,"Rated yet another visit to this place and I was in mood of some desi chai combo . The chai and the samosa which is the best chai combo in the world if your not calorie conscious. The chai as always was amazing and love the hint of masala they add to their chai . The samosa were awesome had white potato which were not too spicy . missed the hari chuteny which could have added lot more taste to the samosa ----- 14 Nov, 2013 ----- As the winters are approaching so is my love for Tea . I love their huge collection of tea and tried most of them .I ordered the Arabic tea which after few minutes of ordering was informed was not available . So I ordered a Darjeeling first flush . First flush is the first harvest of the farming season . The teas are grown on hill from 1600ft to 6000ft elevation . The color of the Darjeeling tea is like a liqueur and the tasting notes are subtle with some sweet notes . Most of the produce is exported outside India . I would suggest you should taste it when you visit cha bar it's like a champagne of teas ----- 07 Oct, 2013 ----- I had visited this place yet again . Having more than 70% of my meals outsides is not health habit at all but what to say "" work hazards"" I wonder if zomato started a new thing for people to review their home food ...sound dangerous ..more than 50% account will be deleted by injury by wife back to the food they sell teas at Rs 35 excluding taxes . And this is the best masala tea in the desi version in India I have ever had . The Tea cake which i Tried which for Rs 60 was amazing . The chilli toast was better than the one I had in a polo lounge in Hayatt Still suggest Oxford to change the bookstore to tea store . No one comes their for books friends For the restaurant details check out my blog goo.gl/DomdOZ & for up close featured pics of the restaurant and food check our Facebook page http://goo.gl/i1Qspp ----- 28 Sep, 2013 ----- Oxford know as a publishing house has come up with a unique concept of bring people and books together by offering them a good "" chai "" . Let's be honest Chai is a comfort drink for most of the people in India because it's way we Indian people enjoy our tea . So is the name in-cashing it called CHA BAR . They over 100 varieties of tea which shows the British obsession with he tea . The place is not the typical London type "" high tea "" charm but it's better than most of the places serving coffee in CP . The white chair and the white marble finish to the table and lightening is refreshing from the stereotypes . The service is not the best thing to be talked about . They are still finding there way around and wondering how is the secondary business of food doing much better business than books . Food vs books . They might want to convert the entire thing into a cafe . The pricing is little on the higher side seeing the portion of the food which they serve . So don't forget to order that extra dish if you looking for a feeling of fulfillment .The taste of food is mix one while some of the things do quite well and some of don't .But food is not something one should visit this place for ,it's should be the love of TEA .

Urvashi,"Rated This was one of those chances when a random plan worked and turned out to be so fab. Cha bar looks like a New York Caf done up in style. Blue roof, white chairs and chandelier like spot lights look so upbeat and up market. Everything in this caf screams panache. It has an American feel to it. People are seen catching up with friends or reading books and the tables are always full yet somehow there is hardly any waiting. The moment I entered and saw red entrance with led lights graffiti, I fell head over heels in love with Cha bar. The awesome feeling of brilliant books doesn't even sink in and the aroma of fresh breads and bakes start tempting you. You follow it to reach their counter where you see the elegant seating area. Food items were something like this- ->Cha bars famous masala chai-served in cutting glass and innovative monkey holder it was the perfect Lahori chai my grandmother makes.All the goodness of ginger, cardamom, clove in one cup to arouse all your cells in the body. Subanallah. Thats what it makes you wanna say. ->Bollywood masala chai-it came in a bollywood style kettle to be had in cutting glass. It was a little cold so sent back and the serving staff happily obliged. This was good in itself but not as good as the other one according to me. ->Pasta-it was in lunch menu and supposed to be served between 2-4 but somehow was being served at 7 in evening. No, I am not complaining because I got to taste this fresh yummy pasta. Every bite of warm fusilli was enjoyed. The garlic bread complemented it nicely which was soft and right in every way. ->Platter-Potato wedges and Mc Cain potato smileys were served with tomato ketchup. Onion rings were missing but never mind. Wedges tasted soo good that I forgot everything else. The mild yet evident herbs flavoring bowled me over. ->Mexican Roll-It was really small compared to other rolls being served on different tables but nevertheless it tasted truly Mexican, quite authentic I would say. ->Coffee was good too with ample of froth In a recent visit I tried the truck drivers chai and boy it was strong enough to clear your entire system and get rid of any hangover. Special mention of the service. Staff is courteous, helpful and pleasing. Their smile and hospitality is welcoming. In every visit some of the dishes are sold out but still this is a 5/5 place for me because of the whole experience. Every place has scope for improvement but sometimes the time you spend and the things you like dominate forcing you to ignore the small minuses here and there. The sheer beauty of this place is in its detailing, the cup holder, spoons, option of brown and white sugar (+1 for that, not very common), pebble stand to dip in flower, kettle etc. Cha bar is simplicity at its best.",Rated 5.0,130,418,??

Deeksha J,"Rated Finding the most comforting leaf to water ratio is a task I consider almost Herculean. Anybody, who therefore achieves to do so, gains my respect. Which is why I absolutely must say that the folks at Cha Bar are truly blessed by the hot beverage gods. Located inside the Flourish & Blotts like Oxford bookstore, this cute little establishment serves as a meeting ground for tea lovers who have grown up on the coffee culture. Don't expect this place to take you back to an era of grandma chic sophistication. What you will find instead is a staggering selection of teas, presented in a faultless manner by knowledgeable servers, in a somewhat industrial set up. I highly recommend the pomegranate tea for those with restricted diets. If the subtle but satiating aroma doesn't convince you, the beautiful colour definitely will. The sunset hued mixed fruit iced tea is a fragrant concoction that is a great thirst quencher. Have it post work to drown the day's sorrows. Besides the usual Darjeeling blends and oolong teas, they have a section of their menu dedicated to Ayurveda teas that actually do what they promise. Infused with the essence of herbs, these are a must post a yoga session. Informal, bustling with people and in short, a total antithesis of traditional tea houses, Cha bar is oh-so-charming, nonetheless.",Rated 4.0,84,1088,??
Shruti Bhat,"Rated I love Cha Bar! The old and the new. The previous Cha Bar was located in Statesman Building, with huge windows and books all around. There wasn't much seating space though, and that was my only issue. The new Cha Bar solves that problem. There are a lot of tables here. A lot! However, on weekends, it still might be difficult to get a table, though there aren't any such issues on weekdays. Walls separate the book store and the cafe, and for the book lovers, this place is nothing less than a zen garden. They have an amazing selection of teas. Though they have other beverages also, try the teas. It fits various budgets and, depending on what you've ordered, you might either get a single glass of chai or a pot of tea which can easily see you through two cuppas at least. I like the katakali tea here. It comes as a single glass and has an amazing, spicy flavour. If you've grown up loving ginger tea, katakali is amazing and a must-try. Their flavoured teas are also really yummy. Their snacks are also good. Their samosas are crisp and delicious, though a little bit on the oily side. But their desserts really take the cake! Their carrot and walnut cake is superb, and so is their red velvet. The service is quick once you've placed the order. This place can cost about Rs. 150-200 per person. It's a place different from the other cafes. It's got great books all around, yummy food and did I mention books? And it's not very expensive. Recommended.",Rated 4.5,76,717,??

Though it was a nice surprise to find it reopened. The tea experience is good I had tried their Hibiscus tea earlier which was very good. This time the caf seemed a little crowded .So I had some their Red velvet cake and the chocolate flourless pastry packed. Take away is a problem as they do not have the appropriately designed takeaway boxes. Though their Red velvet cake was ok and the chocolate flourless pastry was good. Visited today again. Found it better this time. The masala cha/tea was very good .Though they have an extensive and excellent collection of teas. Hot chocolate was good too. The snacks platter is OK.

Neha Mishra,"Rated Ever since Cha Bar, which was earlier located in Statesman Building, had closed down I was keenly following it on social media and waiting for it to reopen. Well, it is primarily a bookstore but is equally a foodie delight as well. Well ever since it has reopened in a grander and a much prettier format I just cannot stop drooling over it. ;) Coming down straight to the items on the menu- they have a spectacular variety of Teas available. Right from the regular Masala Chai to the exotic organic teas, name it and you will have it on the menu. During my visit I tried two of them- the regular Masala Tea which was brilliant- a beautiful mix of kadak and sweet and Tulsi tea which again was a delight in its own special ways. It was just so soothing and a subtle flavor of Tulsi did its trick. Apart from the tea I also tried their Thandai which beats most of the places I have had it earlier. Neither too sweet nor too diluted- my taste buds totally enjoyed it. Along with tea we ordered a mutton roll with Hummus and a Samosa. I was pretty sure that a place like this can't go wrong with Samosa and how right I was. It was just brilliant in its own desi ways. The roll was also soft and fresh but very small so I was left wanting for more. The treat ended with my ever favorite Choco Chip Muffin which I have been having ever since my first visit to this place and they have always been consistent with its quality. The service is quite nice. The servers are friendly and cater to your requests with a smile. They are also well informed about the menu and are always ready to help you make choices if needed. The place is simple yet beautifully done. It is not one of those places that you want to visit only on special occasions. It is in fact perfect for everything- a lazy Sunday afternoon which you want to spend with yourself or a bustling weekday evening when you want to catch up and spend some quality time with your friends.",Rated 4.5,127,1075,??

Nishtha Arora,"Rated I visit this place for the collection of tea they offer and the concept of having books around to pass your time. I have visited this more than 4 times and each time i felt this place to downgrade from initial. I remember there were lot of books and few quiet seating places with bean bags, high stools and comfortable sofas. You could read books endlessly there the whole day The place is slowly going to more seating space and lesser books. However, that's me, they still need to run the business. So straight to pointers now: 1. Tea: They have like 100-150 types of teas. Huge for a tea lover that I am. anything from irish to rum tea to fruit teas. 2. Ambience: the ambience is still one of kind. It's still is the cafe hit place for me in CP . It has large windows to offer sunlight and books around to get conversation starters. 3. snacks: i haven't really tried many . However, they offer a decent range of snacks at affordable prices. 4.

Unless you are using public transport, parking is a %%$# in CP, and this factor is big enough to ensure that Cha Bar isn't my preferred caf to park in for a reading break.

Nimisha99,"Rated A promise of a one-of-a-kind tea experience is what the Cha bar (Oxford Bookstore, Connaught place) offers! Set in a prime location (facing Statesman House) inside the Oxford bookstore, this unconventional cafe will take you by surprise in many more ways than one! I recently had the opportunity of indulging in the many items that their menu has to offer as part of a ""Foodies meet""!! To begin with, the black and white ambience is strangely inviting and peaceful at the same time, its the ideal place to have a conversation over a cup of your favorite tea (a fair warning though: its tough to pick one here since they only have over 150 varieties to offer, I'm not kidding!!, and its likely that you have not tried over 90% of them!) The most wonderful part about this tasting session was that they had made a specialised menu for us where different food items were paired with different types of tea! I had the moroccan mint tea and the chicken caesar salad, the tea had a very soothing flavour of mint and it was so light that one could go and sipping it for hours, the salad had the right amount of dressing coupled with perfectly soft pieces of chicken! Another speciality of Cha Bar is that not only do they serve you the best of the teas from around the world, they do it in style, they have a separate kettle for each tea, that means even the ""Truck driver 100 mile ki cha"" is served in typical tiny stacked glasses that one sees in dhabas located on the highway (and this one was served with some desi style pakodas!) Also, on my way outside I happened to cross the area where they display the teasets, and I just had to capture a picture for everyone to appreciate the beauty and the effort to put in by the owners of Cha Bar to make the customers experience memorable! The Cha bar can also be classified into a mini bakery, as they serve a variety of baked desserts, I tried their flourless chocolate cake and fell in love with its ""melt-in-the-mouth"" texture and rich flavour!! To sum up, go here for the mesmerizing tea and the beautiful teapots, the mouth-watering desserts, the friendly staff and make your everyday tea experience a lot more exciting!! allthingsyummy.in",Rated 4.5,34,182,??
P.G.,"Rated It was a pleasant surprise when I got to know that cha bar has re-opened at CP. It is our all time favourite destination to rejuvenate ourselves amongst the hectic days at work or just to take a break to recapture those lost pleasant/unpleasant moments of lyf. I might sound poetic, but that's what this place makes u once u enter into its serene atmosphere. I haven't yet got a chance to taste all of their tea variants, but amongst all that have tried, I lyk their cutting chai the most and that's best accompanied with their basket of pakoras (that's what thy called thr plate of mix pakoras served in a basket). Even though the current location is more spacious, I do miss the outlet @ the statesman building where we would sit beside the glass panes, watched the commotion of people n thr fast moving vehicles, yet remained aloof as not even a single voice could be heard and be totally drown in our cup of tea. This resembles the attitude we had turned towards our lives, positive or negative, that's still left for judgement.",Rated 4.0,59,292,??

Ridhi Monga,"Rated Their fish and chips are really good! The iced teas are nice, but do tell them to add sugar specifically if you like your tea sweet, they have a tendency to not make it so. Great collection of teas ( there's no way you can try them all in one lifetime ), and the added benefit of being surrounded by books and economical prices makes this place grrrreat!",Rated 3.5,13,9,??
Sheenam Puri,"Rated A very unique cafe situated in CP which is not only an elegant cafe but also a bookstore. The oxford library attracts a lot of people to this place and also the white shiny cafe right next to it. They are very famous for the tea that they serve. There are more than 100 varieties to choose from. Not only that, they also offer a good variety of snacks like rolls, frankies, pastas and sides. The falafal roll is really recommendable and is really delicious. The nacho dish can be given a miss. They were basically pepito crushed n mixed with ketchup!!! When asked about the cheese and beans in the nacho dish, the waitor told me that the beans were finished and told me that they forgot to put the cheese slice in the dish. The service is really very slow, they need to do something about it. The place looks pretty fancy. Its all white and elegant and it not expensive at all. foodonmyplatebysheenam.wordpress.com",Rated 3.0,118,1863,??
Rohan & Neerja,"Rated Oxford is known for its ambience and the novel idea of just walking in a bookstore, and reading for hours. But it has a hidden gem in the form of Cha Bar, which serves great food that makes me want to go there even when I'm not in the mood to read/buy books. Pasta: (White sauce, penne) Excellent, perfect spices, creamy and a generous serving. No accompanying bread, but trust me, you won't feel the need for it. Fish & Chips: It's rare to find fish and chips of good quality at such a reasonable price, and Cha Bar shall fulfill your tartar sauce filled desires. We took these dishes with hot chocolate and a fresh lime soda, both of which were just perfect. No complaints at all, great serving, relaxed ambience, no rush to empty tables. A must go!",Rated 4.5,39,116,??
Sandy,"Rated Brilliant is the word i'll use to describe their concept of opening a CHAI ""BAR"" in a book shop. Thus capitalizing on one of people's favorite hobby- reading a book with a cup of coffee or tea. You'll hardly see anyone yapping around at this place. Most of the visitors are either engrossed in their books or busy discussing their presentations. So if you are looking for a place for college type masti then this certainly isn't a place for you. Others read on!! A friend of mine informed me that earlier it was situated in Statesman House, CP but closed its business there sometime back. Looking at this place, i can only conclude that they must have shifted for bigger better place, as looking at all the hustle bustle at this place, one can't imagine it closing down for bad business. (I've been here twice and both times all the tables were full throughout my stay) One look at their menu and you'll be dumbfounded (like me) for sure. They offer an astounding 150 varieties (YES, you read it right. 150!!) of tea. & here i used to think there were only three- cutting, masala & our household experimental ones :D From the Flowering Teas, Organic Teas, Herbal Teas, Diet Teas, Fruit Teas, to an exclusive range of Darjeeling, Nilgiri, Sikkim and Oolong, complimented by the best in Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Moroccan, Russian, Sri Lankan, South African and Thai Teas. They offer it ALL!! Although one may feel that the quantity is li'l low when compared to their prices. But the varieties and the flavors on offer here won't let prices deter you from visiting this place again and again. On my visits here, i've tried out so far masala cha (being the first item on the menu :D), cutting cha, bollywood cha (which was served in a beautiful kettle which i'm sure everyone is gonna take a picture of :) Emboldened by their rich taste, i even experimented with Tea Mocktails they offer. Margarita i ordered, named devil's paradise, was an absolute revelation in itself. Thumbs up for that one in particular. Each and every one of them had a unique taste. Taste which will linger in your mouth long after you've left this place. They offer salads, sandwiches, wraps, samosas, nachos .etc. too, but i won't get into their details as the TEA is the Star at this ""Bar"" ;) Rest assured they all taste fine too. Would've given this place a perfect 5.0 had their service not been superslow. Still, Definitely not a place to miss. Can't wait to go there for the third time :) MUST VISIT!!!!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Ilma Mirza,"Rated Cha bar is the unique cafe in its own way. The best place for tea lovers and obviously for book lovers as its situated in oxford book store in N block. Interiors are good mix of blues and white. Good ambience. -4/5 Food- I and my friends had white sauce pasta and red sauce pasta. They were just average. Infact, white sauce pasta was too salty which we asked to change and so they did without any hesitance. We had lemon flavoured tea and peppermint tea, they were really good and I would recommend you to try them if you like to try something different in tea . I am giving 3/5 to food. Staff- good staff Overall rating 4/5 Definitely a must visit.",Rated 4.0,23,44,??

Gaurav Sharma,"Rated Nostalgic. I haven't been to the revamped version yet, but I was a regular at Cha Bar during those days when CCD wasn't another coffee shop next door, phones weren't so smart and the last station of yellow line was C-Sec. Anyone who loves to read will absolutely fall in love with Cha-Bar. Although I am not an avid reader, but the charming atmosphere forced me to stay there longer. It's an excellent geeky hangout place. And the perfect place to hold long conversations. The food is really nice and the pricing is on the lower side. I always used to order Masala Chai which was served in a typical roadside masala-chai glass.I was a vegetarian then, so stuck mostly to toasties and muffins; which were pretty good. I am definitely visiting Cha Bar again after writing this review. I'd give a 5/5 to the ambience, I haven't been to many such places where I feel like sitting forever. Yes, it's that brilliant!",Rated 4.0,314,2014,??
Sundeep And Bedabrata,"Rated Chai Garam!! CP doesn't cease to surprise us. Every time we think we have seen and experienced CP, it throws a googly. My friend who is a tea-totaller (always looking for a chai wala around the corner) sounded a little difficult to handle on one of the warmest afternoons in Delhi when he suggested having tea. To redeem my patience I suggested cha bar - a tea joint that I had read about recently. It's a great place from the word GO. A part of Oxford book store, cha bar provides the perfect ""blend"" of erudition and spunk. The decor is contemporary and classy. The sitting arrangement provides sufficient space for people to meander in their own intellectual worlds. Cha bar serves a variety of tea, coffee and light to heavy snacks and lunch. As first timers we decided to opt for the simplest items on the menu. ""Cha bar blend"", ""Cha Hindustani-ginger"" and ""Cha Piazi"" (onion fritters). The Hindustani Cha was served in a dhaba style glass with a metallic monkey shaped holder. The sugar, tea, ginger and milk, everything was mixed to perfection. The cha bar blend is a light decoction of aromatic tea which tasted equally great with and without milk. This came in a teapot and the quantity was good enough to make two cups of tea. Wish the onion fritters were crispier! But who cares. Special mention - the restroom had psychedelic tiles and was very clean. We were very excited to discover this oasis amidst the many CCDs or watering holes in CP. Unpretentious, affordable and very Chai Garam!! -------------------------------New Review---May 26----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Riding on the Narendra Modi wave, Cha Bar at Connaught Place has been serving NaMo chai since general election result day. Served in a basic aluminium kettle ( Modis pic on it), it came with dhaba style glasses. The tea was brewed in thick milk and was lightly flavored with masala and tulsi. The tulsi was very energising and the quantity of the tea was enough to kick three people. As a side we ordered a slice our all time favorite english tea cake. The idea is very novel. Salute to the democracy system that enables someone to reach the highest office, his frugal background notwithstanding. Incidentally, the tea was unsweetened but when we saw the bill and realised that this was on the house, that sweetened our experience. :-) delhi-fun-dos.com",Rated 5.0,74,1843,??
Aditi Rajvanshi,"Rated I have mixed feelings about this place. The good first: i go there for the 'cha', the Place is dedicated to chai, that's the best thing about it. I'm a tea addict and this place is thus my paradise for the amazing variety it offers. It's located at a decent place in CP and is easy to locate and convenient to reach. It's housed inside a bookstore, the second best part of the deal. The bad: the service, it takes forever to get your order and this has happened to me almost everytime I've been there. I don't mean that the servers were rude in anyway (they were nice) but probably they're short staffed. The decor, is white and black, which makes it feel very cold and metallic. Not really something you'd expect from a chai place. If only it was wooden, warm and cozy, I'd shut my mouth and just give you a 5 on 5 despite the bad service. Ah well, I'm still going to visit again. Like I said, I like (love) tea! Oh and the chocolate cup cakes aren't bad either :)",Rated 3.5,5,41,??

Rohit Gupta,Rated The previous Cha Bar had set the bar high when it came to taste. The recently opened version is a horrible rebirth. We ordered for a bun omelette which was perhaps the only item which was fresh. The chicken pot pie tasted stale and the carrot cake was served cold. To add to our woes each item was served with a gap of 5-10mins. All in all- a disappointment!,Rated 1.0,1,30,??
Anweshaa Ghosh,"Rated Cha Bar is back!!! We sooo missed u when u closed down! and so we had to visit you... Ambience - I loooved the big windows at the Statesman House that looked down on Barakhamba Road and was disappointed to not seeing them here. The new Oxford Book shop cum cha Bar looks more like a 'Lounge in a Sci-Fi movie'. I believe it's a typical Priya Paul (Owner of Oxford Book stores, Park hotels,etc.) design as is evident from the not so recently revamped Park Hotel in Kolkata. Maybe l am old-fashioned, but I like books in a warm environment. Somehow I can't enjoy rustling through books in neon-lit spaces. It hurts my eyes. Since, this is a bookstore -cafe, I would have liked it if they would have kept it simple and cosy. The new decor is white/black/ blue and steel is too obnoxious for me! Food- About the food, I do not have any complain. The menu is quite exhaustive and the quality is better than before! We ordered a non-veg platter which has 2 pcs of chicken samosa, baby sausages, chicken lollipops and mutton sheekh kebab - full paisa vassol! I tried the lavender tea and they gave me a full two cups of it which was really nice and relaxing. The friend ordered an ice tea and was satisfied. No Complaints here! Service: The staff does take some time to look at your waving hand but that's a minor deterrance. They are courteous, quick and efficient. I think I have put an extra 0.5 rating for the nostalgia it provoked for us. The ambiance for me was a put off but the food did help to pull up the ratings!!",Rated 3.5,61,631,??
Namrata Gambhir,"Rated I have very fond memories of Cha Bar because I often hung out at Cha Bar, Statesman House during my college days. I was very saddened when Cha bar shutdown, but I am glad it has now reopened. Here's my take on Cha Bar:- Food: 5/5 My friend and I ordered masala tea, cheese toasties, and french fries. The cheese toasties were sprinkled with green chili and were really yum. The French Fries were nicely fried, and were definitely way better than the commercial fries you get at the fast food joints-with standard thickness. Sometimes imperfection is a welcome change I guess. The masala tea was nice, but the quantity was less-though I liked the glass holders very much. Ambience: 5/5 I loved their kitchen. The kitchen has an ambient decor-it has a very colonial feel to it, yet it also has a modern outlook. I guess Lutyens would have appreciated the architecture. The seating area lights somehow gave me a distinct impression of sitting on a sci-fi movie set. Service: 5/5 The service staff was super-sweet. Value for money : 5/5 I think this place is worth every penny you spend here!",Rated 4.5,77,723,??
