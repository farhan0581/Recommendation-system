Somya Pandey,"Rated I visited this place for a dinner. There was a concert going on. The sound was too high. Thus I choose the rooftop seating. The seating was quite good and there was nothing special about it. I ordered a veg shawarma roll and a Bell peper Margarita ,Batch Type Vanilla Vodka which were quite good and filling though a little bit dry. Overall it was an very good experience!",Rated 4.5,15,17,??
Rajat Choudhary,Rated I simply love this place.i have never been disappointed Went for second time.Ordered Mustard Fish chilli with Beer and combo really worked well for me.Looking to visit again and try their complete seafood range for sure.

Nitanshi Agarwal,"Rated A typical cafe in connaught place, it wont offer you anything different as such. The food is decent, slightly over priced and very standard. I had a margherita pizza and my friend ordered a chicken sandwich. Both were nicely prepared, then again, not very difficult dishes to prepare.

Gaurav,Rated It was my birthday when i reached this place. And it was my 1st visit in warehouse cafe. Coming to the food we order cheese spinach corn role it was worth it.

Aastha Parmar,Rated The most talked about cafe in cannaught place. I visited here for the second time and we ordered for pasta and pizza. The white sauce pasta lacked spices and didn't tasted good. The warehouse special non veg pizza was no doubt really amazing in taste but it lacked chicken pieces. This experience of warehouse cafe was totally unsatisfactory.

Aditya Panwar,"Rated We went on a weekday, daytime. Ambience is nice, though they can work on their warehouse theme some more, service is a bit lazy-ed up too even during the daytime.

Urvi,"Rated Went there a couple of days back, absolutely loved their ambiance specially the terrace and roof top with a variety of seating options from high bar chairs to couches and garden chairs and tables. Had a chilled out relaxing time there! Ordered a paneer starter which was just about average, and a pizza. The food was pretty ordinary but they have an exhaustive menu and some other dishes could be nice. However I would suggest the place for its ambiance and the relaxed feel of the place. The staff was pretty responsive, courteous and helpful but couldn't help us with correcting of a dangling table, err. The do have some room for improvement at various counts. But I would surely visit again especially for the ambiance and to try other menu options! Surely head there on a pleasant sunny day for the roof top experience!",Rated 3.5,31,76,??
Sachin,Rated Really like the ambiance specially the open space. Though food was average so were the mocktails. Ordered warehouse pizza n staff didn't bother to ask if we like it or not plus was cold within like 5 mins and have to tell them to reheat.

Vivek Wadhwa,Rated The food was pathetic. What i ate Starters :- Chicken dishes were UNDERCOOKED Veg. :- i don't eat any Drink :- mocktails took ages to be made Cocktails were pathetic Lets talk main course 4 dishes 2 veg (which I didn't taste) 2 non veg One was some crappy dish made with lamb which had vegetables in it than lamb and it looked more like a Manchurian dish than anything associated to lamb Second was a chicken dish in white gravy which was so bland that I ended up eating just NOTHING. I should've given a minus rating if there was a provision One advice for all just never plan a group party for this shit junk place. Waiters don't hear you out properly. At the end There are n number of places out there with much better food making skills.,Rated 1.0,1,0,??
Kshitij Verma,"Rated In an area surrounded by gazzilions of bars and lounges, warehouse cafe has to stand out..not only because of nice ambience and a great spread of food, but more so because of the amazing view of the entire inner circle from the roof top seating area.. Apart from the pitchers of beer, we ordered chicken Kali mirch tikka, chicken barbecue strips and a sheesha.. The sheesha, though incredibly expensive, was full of flavour and lasted a long while, the tikka was OK, though I'd expected a lot more juice in the chicken, but the fried bbq strips were simply amazing and easily the best part of the meal.. I'd definitely reccomend the place and am shortly gonna try their new outlet in Gurgaon(one I visited the day it opened and sadly had no liquor to offer)..

Malvika Thakur,"Rated In the heart of Connaught Palace facing the flamboyant Tiranga, definitely a place to be at the weekend. One of the best roof top restaurants in delhi offering elaborate menu for both bar and with cuisines, topped up with some wonderful live performances. The resturant is divided into various sections, however i found the rooftop to be the best one. Especially coz later it gets very packed downstairs. Had a great evening hope to have more",Rated 4.5,41,191,??

Isha Dara,Rated I have wanted to visit this place since so long and had very high expectations of it but it did not turn out to be THAT great. We sat outdoors on a sunny afternoon in February. They have a huge terrace and which is quite impressive. We ordered honey chilly chicken and warehouse special pizza and two kingfisher ultra and it costed us around 1700. Honey chilly chicken was average and we did not like it much. The portion was also small. Value for money? Don't think so. The pizza was really good. It was vegetarian with generous amount of cheese and toppings. I wish they had tissue boxes instead of tissue holders on the terrace since all the tissues would frequently fall off due to the wind and they had to dump all of them. Guess that's a lot of wastage.,Rated 3.5,8,3,??

My friends and I ordered the kasturi chicken kebabs, veg enchiladas, mushroom kurkure, veg spring rolls and chilli paneer. I liked the kebabs and mushrooms. The rest of the lot was average. We also ordered a few cocktails. The cocktails were satisfactory. Nothing innovative on the drinks menu. Some options were only available for a pitcher order which was a bit of a disappointment. Overall, this place was good for the food.",Rated 3.5,13,68,??

Ravneet Kaur,"Rated I visited the place along with my buddies on Saturday, 30 January. It was not for the first time i was visiting this place but this Saturday meet with friends was special so i thought instead of trying a new random place i should go to the tried and tested place , The warehouse cafe. I wish i shouldn't have taken that decision. We started the evening by ordering beer n a cheese Nachos. The beer seemed overpriced compared to any other place in Connaught Place at 4PM , as there were no happy hours. The nachos were all soggy.. Then we thought its okay lets order a hukka and a pizza. Hukka was just OKAY nothing special that too for 1000.. eeh another mistake... Now we didn't want to move our ass to some other place as the chit chat was giving us the necessary hit. Then ordered a pitcher of blue frog, thinking a cocktail would add stars to the evening.. but it turned out to be the same PATHETIC and a fraud as the alcohol content was very low and the drink was diluted. By now i was completely pissed. Complaining to the staff was a choice i had but could not opt for it as the staff was extremely impolite. Now was the turn for another turn off the bill... all this bullshit costed me 5000 bugs.. i was like what the f**k. How could they .. then i looked around and realized they are in the business of making fool and I was definitely just another customer to them. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone and will never visit there again... I think the administration should step out and see the way other cafes in CP serve and the quality they serve. SAD, DISAPPOINTED, DEJECTED and ANNOYED i was by the end of that Saturday night. @richa Mohan @vaishnavi bansal",Rated 2.0,10,72,??

Rajiv Gupta,Rated ONE OF THE WORST PLACE FOR FOOD OR DRINKS OR EVEN HOSPITALITY. Where to start... It usually happens with a place which make me angry like anything else. Still I will write. 1 is the lowest rating that's why one. I heard a lot about this place from people and my Zomato feed. Everyone talked some good things about this place so I finally decided to go there yesterday with 2 of my friends. Firstly the lady who stands downstairs near lift told us that there is no waiting so we decides to board the lift. Reaching upstairs we were greeted with a waiting list and asked by a manager(yeah that's what he seems like) to stand near the drinks serving area.. We waited for ten minutes and realized there are people coming and taking seats. We then asked a manager named Mr. Suri I guess and he asked us to take seat in front side from there a waiter asked us to take seat somewhere else and we finally took a seat on which Mr manager behaved so rudely that how can we enter family area as if you broke a queue for free ration... (Sir you forgot to put a board saying family area.. You forgot to train your waiter that he knows which area is that.. You could have asked politely). By seeing such a careless and rude behavior we thought of leaving but still decided to have food thinking that there must be something extraordinary about food here otherwise people shouldn't have given such a good rating to such non professional and rude managers and waiters. We ordered a dahi kebab which was totally blend in taste... Most of the beers were not available... The one available was not chilled(hot beer that's why the name has warehouse Cafe). We then ordered a achari paneer on another manager recommendation which was made such a spicy that after one piece we had to keep it side(although I hate wasting food)... The bad story continued... We asked for wifi Password to which we were informed that it's not for customers... Then suddenly a guy came out from somewhere and asked us to install a app named rupli.. And he gave the wifi Password as well(ah!! Surprised) .. Finally when the bill came they didn't even had a working credit card machine (do I still live in year 2000 or they think that they are giving food at such cheap prices that people always carry few thousand bucks in cash?) So in all worst food.. With worst service... But some good ambience..... Definitely not going again and will help people getting aware about this place before going.. Name suits them well (warehouse cafe),Rated 1.0,137,2990,??

Drishey Valecha,"Rated The DJ in the house is well equipped and the music captures your attention. Although there isn't much dancing space, one can't just sit around and not groove to the tunes of the DJ. Tidbits for nibbling are just fine to have with your drinks. Food is even better. They do serve drought beer. Nice place to have a good time as they offer both indoor and outdoor seating with sports screening facility.",Rated 4.0,19,5,??

Ankita Adhikari Verma,"Rated Situated at the heart of the capital, spread over two floors and a view of the connaught place and the Indian flag is awesome, the food tastes good, amazing sandwiches and Italian.. the evenings are beautiful.. and the gentry is usually good.

Star Swati,"Rated Diverse menu, at times, surprisingly, ""wow"" me :) Though saying the same every time, will be little exaggerating. Found the terrace interesting, even in chilling Delhi air.

Riddhi,"Rated I had gone here with a group of friends,around 4-5 people. We sat in the covered area, and there were hardly any lights. I know cafes are supposed to be not all bright and stuff but this was way too dark, with no music. The service was below average. The person serving us and a few of the other waiters were standing very near to our table and that was highly uncomfortable. We ordered an achari paneer tikka and French fries, and soft drinks. The French fries were okay. The paneer tikka was bad. Me and one of my friends got a minor food poisoning after eating it. I mean, I'm paying so much just to fall ill? I don't think I'm going to this place ever again.",Rated 2.5,15,23,??

Even the main course is nice which is a rarity in most of the cafes..,Rated 3.5,31,38,??
Jayantika Sarwal,"Rated After a lot many visits to this place, I finally am penning down my thoughts about it. Spaced over 2 floors and an amazingly viewed open terrace seating, this place is no different from the stock in the mushrooming pool of cafes these days.. What appeals to me about this place is their very comfortable terrace seating. It surely stands out. Mesmerized by the view of CP alongside enjoying the Delhi weather, sure takes a front seat in all cases.. So diving deep down into the nuances of the overall experience, have a read further. MENU I am totally in love with the menu. Arranged month wise with tons of options to scroll through, the menu is an absolute relishing affair. The first impression created is of an enticing dine in ahead. A bug thumbs up to it. AMBIANCE Pretty much similarly themed indoors. One striking thing is the lavishly spread bar area across the entire width of the entire place just near the entrance. As you step in, you'd notice a large LCD TV screen, very loud music, dark interiors, small tables.. Ample tables to not be standing in the queue in not so peak hours. FOOD For me, or any other food lover the food is something that makes or breaks the image of a place the person is visiting.. This place doesn't stand out for me in this parameter. It is decent enough, but sadly not great. Some of the items that were ordered by us in order to have a wow experience, but didn't get one were : Warehouse Pizza : Amalgamation of available veggies with jalapeos, it is yet another thing crust pizza but just with more than just a pinch of salt. The oil used while baking was very well felt in the fingers while having a bite. Sad, but true. Veg Tandoori Platter A lot of veg assortments of the non veg counterpart. From dahi ke kebab, to galouti kebab, marinated paneer, veg seekh kebab and a lot more accompanied with pickled onions and mint chutney. Worth having. Very nice. For the vegans, it's a nice choice. For a lot many other dishes, the tastes didn't stand out as expected, hence creating a wave of disappointment.! SERVICE : Nice. Fast enough to manage a Sunday noon.. An overall good experience, but not outstanding enough to bring me back here again and again..",Rated 3.5,58,546,??
Karan Singh,"Rated Have been here multiple times and always a good experience so far. Drinks and food are alright , hookah is nice , music is not too loud that you cant have a conversation , screen there as well if you into watching sports , outdoor seating facing the park in cp is quite nice if weather is good, lighting also dim and the overall look of a warehouse kinda fits here.

Divit Mishras,"Rated Warehouse cafe situated in the heart of CP. This place has a beautiful bar area which is well stocked with drinks, rest of the bar has a common look like almost all the cafes in CP, the look from the terrace though is awesome.

Priyanka Sharma,"Rated If i have to define this place in one word! I will call it lively... It's huge and it's one of those dim lights cafe! We tried Italian and it's really good, I mean the cheese quantity was apt. . We ordered drinks which were not very over priced.. one thing which I want to mention is that it's one of the few places in Delhi where you can do sheesha.. nonetheless it's so expensive, you will be like what the hell at the time of bill payment. . And yes they play amazing music and they play it really loud so if you want to go to a place where you can have a chit chat then this is certainly not the one. .

Arindam Sarkar,"Rated First of all, the hilighted picture of the terrace does NOT match with the actual. In reality, the boundary is a 4-feet high wall with bar-style seating adjacent to it. So you practically have to yank your neck everytime to get even a descent outside view. Other seats do NOT have any view. Just open sky above. But the Terrace in general seems nice with standalone fire heaters adding character to the place. Most of the drinks (cocktails) were not available. Food was just average, although did not try anything vegetarian.",Rated 2.5,19,7,??
Devesh Patel,Rated It is basically good to be visited for trying out the Draught Beer. The ambience looked very rusty. The Bar had sufficient space to accommodate groups of 10-15 people like we were then. The Beer was chilled and gave us enough enjoyment that we desired. The Background music was good too. It was a good we spent over here. I would recommend this place definitely for its beers!,Rated 4.0,19,86,??

Ramit Lal,"Rated Been to Warehouse cafe a couple of times with my friends and have always enjoyed the time we spend here. We always prefer to take the rooftop seating so as to enjoy the atmosphere around us. The service can be a hit or miss as we haven't got the best service here. The food here is good especially the Tandoori Fish Tikka, Warehouse special pizza and Lamb Burger. Wish they work on the service and get it improved.",Rated 4.0,4,124,??
Gargi,"Rated A good place to visit with friends or when on a date. The best place to sit is the rooftop even on a winter night. The prices of alcoholic drinks are economical and so are the rates of the food. I tried the recommended dish-chilli chicken. It was pretty good, not overly spicy or any other anomaly. For main course we ordered Red thai chicken curry and veg hakka noodles. I am no sure whether it is standard or not but we got a complimentary rice bowl along with our order. This we could not finish of course. For drinks, we took 2 pitchers of beer which was surprisingly at a great price! The service was 6/10 and our server was also not very well informed about the dishes. But the beer, music and ambience made up for these shortcomings. Will visit again! PS.

@ Foodie Prerna,"Rated I visited this place few days back.. Heard so much about this place which compelled me to visit there.. This place goes well with the theme.. Rooftop is the best place to sit and grab drinks there, you can have a good view of Central Park. Place is quite amazing. Decent crowd there. Service was good and food was yummy. Specially the Oreo shake that I ordered is worth it..",Rated 4.0,35,733,??
Anwesha Guha,"Rated Amazing place to visit with friends on a cold Saturday evening. Try the roof top for a great view of the whole Cannaught place. We lucky got ourselves a table in the roof top and ordered Mozzarella fingers and Nachos starters. Both was yummy but the Mozzarella fingers had got a little cold by the time it came to our table. Otherwise, we had a nice time here.",Rated 4.0,47,82,??

Rounak Mohanty,Rated Awesome place......the rooftop is the place to be. The ambiance inside is also great and it is a pretty big place. But tge roof top definitely has a different feel to it.....The view of the inner circle and the National flag is epic. The prices are reasonable and the food is really good.

The day was so bright and sunny, so the rooftop was perfect to soak up the sun. It was easy to down 3 pitchers of beer!

Among sll the food we ordered, I loved the Spicy BBQ Chicken Wings, and also the Cheese poppers.

Food : This gives it an edge over other Cafes as almost all the items on the menu are to die for. Music : Yes, I mentioned it in the review.

Now coming to the food...its good...nothing special nothing to complain about...we ordered chicken tikka...chilly chicken... Spicy chicken pizza...butter chicken...everything was good...we had liit in cocktails..and it was awesome.. 10 on 10...all this for 4600...this was the best thing...their pricing...totally paisa vasool.... Now some negative points....their dj and music...really a spoilsport...what was he playing man... The staff...needs to be a bit more gentle and conscious... I mean first u dnt welcome ur guest and den u ask them to chng seats since it is reserved... Bottom line is warehouse cafe is just another cafe in town...nothing special...

Vishesh Monga,"Rated My experience at warehouse caf comprised of ups and downs. Although it was a satisfying experience but not enough to rate it well. The ambience is is just like that of any common ordinary lounge in CP. Their service was good initially, but went on lagging as the time passed. The best quality about this place was the presentation of food, which was spot on. Amongst the dishes we ordered there were a few duds.... Nuttela Shake- Too much of sugar and water, with less of milk ruined the shake entirely. Juicy Lucy Lamb Burger- A stark contrast to the name, the burger was dry and surprisingly had no cheese filling. (Which is expected to be juicy lucy) Tandoori Roti- If I mention a roti in a review then imagine how bad it could be. Guys, it's a roti atleast use wheat! Some dishes were like ....... Fine! Chicken Curry- A little too salty and too much ginger brought down the dish that could otherwise be a hit. Fish tikka- Fish quality used was a let downer. Also,it wasn't served hot and had to get it heated. Veg lasagna- This was one of the better dishes, above fine standards. The texture was good but was a little dry. And now for the exceptionally good dishes..... Virgin Colada- Kudos Warehouse, you won my heart with this drink. Nachos with chicken- The dips served along stole the show. Warehouse Grilled Chicken- Authentic german style grill with amazing flavours. Khao Suey Veg & Chicken- They were perfect starts to what seemed a decent meal.",Rated 3.0,58,760,??

Shashwat Vikram Singh,"Rated Always dimly lit, this 'cafe' has a nice ambience. Heavy on the pocket, they need to work on alot of areas to improve overall client satisfaction. First, food. The Thai Pan Pizza we ordered was amazing, but the vegetable platter was literally the worst I've ever had in Connaught Place. Second, wait staff. You need to either station someone at every table (not probable), or force them to be more attentive. We had to get up ourselves to call one to our table for the tiniest of things. Tone the music down if need be. Third, hukkahs. Just stop serving those. There is absolutely no need of mixing random flavours and giving them fancy names if you cant get them right. Keep it simple! Fourth, and most important of all, DON'T CALL YOURSELVES A 'CAFE' IF YOU DON'T HAVE HOT COFFEE. Seriously!",Rated 2.0,40,33,??

Sanyukta Gupta,"Rated Situated in the heart of Delhi,(CP) I have been to this place now atleast 6-7 times. The ambience is nice, though the lift part is a little confusing it's a nice cafe. Food: The food is nice, specially butter chicken pasta. They have this concept of calendar menu I.e. On whatever date you go, there's a food item and if you order that it's at half the price, which I thought to be very nice and the food itself is of good quality. With food their drinks are also nice but a little overpriced with my bar and more around them as competitors. I would like to give food 3.5/5. Service and Quality: Service is not slow, it's moderate. They give Good gaps between the meals and nicely present them. The quality is medium not to super and of course not low, for a chilling hangout I would again go there, it's one of those kind. Hooka: (again over priced) Overall review: it's a nice hangout place for students as well as for adults, it's a busy place and quiet spacious I would recommend to atleast go there once it's worth a try.",Rated 3.5,31,69,??

We were a group of 6 and we all have loved the vibe of this place since it opened its doors. The food is amazing as they have one of biggest menus you will ever come across. We ordered the veg platter, cheese sticks, chilli chicken and chicken pasta, every dish was just perfect both in terms of quantity and quality. My friends told me The hookah was good as well. The music has always been great at this place, for drinks i had the virgin mojito which was perfect, 1 of my friend had shakes and she liked them as they were neither too heavy nor too light, a few others had 5 beers and a glass of red whine, all this cost us 6800 !! which I must admit was much less than what i had expected., maybe I went after such a long time that I forgot how nominal their prices have always been or maybe they have slashed prices which I am not sure about .. or maybe they missed some items in the bill.... I hope not ..if someone from the management is reading this then kindly ignore the last line ... it was a typo ... :D ..all in all a perfect place to chill out with friends and family as its always been. If you haven't been here then its a must visit place.. if you have been wanting to come here and you think maybe its not as good as it was .. well i can assure you its still a classic place and easily retains its place as one of the best joints in CP and I will be heading back here soon.",Rated 4.0,17,103,??

Adhiratna Jha,"Rated I come here at least once or twice a month. The ambiance is amazing and the restaurant is very spacious. The music is generally great which adds up to the good time that is spent here. The waiters are well versed of the details of menu and generally give pretty good suggestions on what to order. Though a bit pricey, but overall experience and the food quality compensates very well for it. Dimsums and nachos are my favorite snacks over here. Never tried Hookah here, but apparently it is very popular among the visitors over here. Cocktail menu is good but very expensive compared to similar restaurants, so I generally avoid getting drunk over here. :P Just to give a heads up that this might not be correct place if you want to have chat with friends rather than eat and drink. Music is always loud and the furniture are set in a way that you have to shout anything and everything. Overall its a great place for hanging out, spend time and have good food.",Rated 4.5,10,1,??

Rahul Singhal,"Rated Warehouse caf is the new hangout place because of two reasons, one is its size which can accommodate a lot of people and two is its location which is central to most of the people.

Mohit,"Rated Crashed here with a few friends for a quick meet-up. The distinct orange LED lights immediately capture your attention when you grab a seat and look around. The interiors are made of dim lighting and exposed bricks. The music is loud and the quality of the speakers isn't that good. Same goes for the choice of music played here. The place was relatively unoccupied on a Saturday evening. It's spread across two floors so may be most of the people were on the other floor. Anyways, the interiors are cool but it's a bit too dark for my taste. The waiting staff was also exhibiting brownian motion. They were moving around just like that, yet no one even offered us water. I had to scream (thanks to the loud music) to get a waiter's attention. Finally, got some water after a considerable delay. We did not eat anything here.

Shabih Abbas,"Rated Visisted this cafe a few months back on my friends birthday and I was pleasantly surprised as it was a Saturday evening around nine, The music was loud but it was good. The pace was packed. I could see some large groups and a family as well. The pace is dimly lit, its large in terms of area and has comfortable seating. We ordered a few pints of beer a hookah and a pizza and some BBQ chicken Skewers( I don't remember the exact name). I am not a huge fan of the hookah but it was good. I liked the pizza which was square in shape. Skewers were nothing great. We paid around 3500 for all this for a group of three. My verdict- Its a nice place no doubt, the food is not great but nothing to complain about either. The seating is plush and the place is very roomy. They have a well stocked bar and I specially loved the bar chairs. It is slightly on the expensive side, so if money is a concern for you then you would be better off going to either ""The vault cafe"" or ""The lord of the drinks"". All an all a pleasant experience.

Linda Pearlson,"Rated Located at a very convenient right next to Gate No.3 of the Rajiv Chowk metro station, this place automatically is a natural attraction who wanna just sit and chill in one place. The dim lights give a total cozy pub look. We got confused looking at the menu since its in a calendar format, so we were wondering if one certain dishes are served at that particular day :o but obviously, it's just a format and they do serve everything mentioned on the menu. We ordered for Chicken and cheese nachos. Bbq sauce chicken, bacon and jalapeo pizza and some drinks. The food was average, and definitely cannot be termed extraordinary. The chicken and cheese nachos did not even have 0.1% of chicken chunks. It was more or less vegetarian. The quality was less for Bbq sauce chicken but taste was fine. The pizza was good, but cannot be applauded for. So next time, if I just wanna talk and come off, I can check this place. But to hog, it's a No-No.",Rated 2.5,18,23,??

The music was a tad bit too loud but great and the look was pretty amazing The food was beyond what I expected after some of the reviews I read. We had a spaghetti with arabiata sauce which was spot on with the herbs and tons of cheese which I like, dahi kebabs which tasted great with its amazing side order and then the Caesar salad which was just as awesome.. Crispy lettuce with tomatoes and jalapeno and the caesar dressing. The drinks were chilled and good Hookah was the best I've had in a long time.. Chilled base with double apple mint..

They were standing and chatting around, not paying attention when called for. It took us about forty mins to just place an order. Half the ratings are gone because of your service, warehouse! Coming to the food, we ordered the drums of heaven, the chicken chimichangas and pan fried noodles with chicken. Except for the drums of heaven, nothing was good. The pan fired noodles were bland and watery. The chimichangas were okay. Just deep fried with some amount of capsicum and cheese. Not worth it. Never want to go back.",Rated 2.5,103,594,??

I must say that lighting an be improved because one cannot even read the menu as its so dark. The servers don't even have flash lights per say. Anyways, once we were seated, our server got us menus etc. Their 50% deal on dish of the day is a unique thing. Their deals on retail pricing, ware house pricing for drinks is off the table. It doesn't make sense at all. One can easily order a bottle in less price. We ordered for Strawberry margarita (this was good) and Bhatti paneer (this was very good too) along with Commissioner Sheesha (full of flavours). Our sheesha server was very helpful. The place has a nice ambience to it especially because its inner circle and you can see the Big Indian Flag on Rajiv Chowk. We left after one round of drinks as we were bar hopping.

Aditi Arora,"Rated I went there last saturday, we were 5 and cos we reached quite early so easily got a table without reservation on the lower floor, terrace was somehow already full and required half an hour waiting, but the whole cafe got full within no time afterwards. Ambience is nice cos I found this cafe a bit on the expensive side so found good crowd over there. Service was great didn't wait for more than 20 minutes which was reasonable for me considering it was a sat evening. They got 2 big projectors as well to showcase any imp match. Now focussing on the food, we ordered chily chicken (as per the recommendation), veg tandoori platter, warehouse spcl pizza, penne makhani and virgin mojito. Though the chilly chicken preparation was good but the quantity was too less, you could have easily get double the quantity at half the price from any good chinese restaurant, veg platter here the quantity was good hara bhara kebab, dahi kebab and paneer tikkas were way too yummy somehow found the seekh kebabs bit dry, pizza was average nuthhing 'special' but pasta was to die for, it was too delicious,'a must have' and mojito was average.. All and all a good place to spend time with friends, colleagus not that much recommended for family cos of bit loud music.. Yes can be a bit heavy on pockets :)",Rated 3.5,3,21,??

Mohsin Hussain,"Rated Heard about this place a lot from friends. So finally I decided to visit. The interior was pretty good. Good staffs in suits. I ordered for a tenderloin steak. I was asked how would you like it sir? I said medium rare. While I was waiting for the steak I decided to get myself a drink. The mojito was good. Would call it a perfect blend. The steak was served with mashed potatoes and some veggies. Looked good. But it was full cooked. When I asked the gentleman who served me that I specifically ordered for medium rare, I was told that this what medium rare is like. I do understand that Delhi is not the place for steaks but if you have it on your menu then you should know about it. I preferred not to argue. Somehow ate it as I was hungry and finished a couple of mojitos. So basically its all a hype. If you want amusement this is the place where you would want to go but if you are a foodie dont even go near it..it not meant for you",Rated 2.0,6,14,??
Debroto Roy,Rated Nice cosy ambience... Perfect for an evening lounge sittings. Good music friendly service.

Mypartyvenue.in,"Rated Warehouse Cafe has gained a Cult status among the plethora of restrobar options available in Connaught Place. A place which guarantees you a good experience every single time. A masterpiece of Mr. Priyank Sukhija, Warehouse Cafe, is my all time favourite restrobar considering the lively crowd, exhaustive menu, moderately priced booze and its classy and elegant ambience. It has an amazing rooftop seating with an excellent view of the entire Connaught Place. With dim lights and foot tapping music there is nothing more you could ask for an excellent party spot...

Staff is really courteous and do take care of your requests well. Being a south indian i had to try the "" Chicken 65"" .

Bakul Sharma,"Rated After getting so hooked up in a meeting in rajouri garden, I called up one of my fast friends to accompany me as I wanted to have some beers... as he turned up , he suggested this warehouse cafe. We reached warehouse, and boarded the lift, which had all the schemes on the walls they were offering. As the lift opens my expectations got high as the bar was really good. With very dim lights we somehow managed to to find our seats, as we wanted the seat near the screens so that we cud enjoy the SA/India cricket match... We then ordered a pitcher of beer along with chicken65 after a huge brainstorming with a lengthy menu. It tasted good ut the presentation could be even better as per the price. The prices were on the higher side but I can understand as it's cannaught place... I found music a bit loud as we found it difficult to interact with each other... Now coming to service I would say that it was over staffed but none of them managed to serve us with a glass of water as we settle down... the service delivery was very slow as it took 40 minutes to get chicken 65 served... Then we checked out the terrace n found it better than the lounge... I'll visit again if u guys promise to get me seated on terrace with a better service...",Rated 3.5,4,3,??

We took a table for two and the way it was arranged, we ended up sitting too far from each other. Music was a bit too loud for the day time meal specially when its not a DJ who is playing live. Also the speakers where kept next to our table on the ground - setting should be such that one table should not become victim of it.

The greatest USP of the place was an excellent view of the CP central park , but now with scores of other establishments offering similar or even better view , even that is not such a big thing .

I am not a Biryani lover but here I just couldn't resist eating despite of full stomach. Biryani was served with curd and green chutney. The green chutney was just too amazing...

Ambience Ambience was above OK, pretty much dark.. One cn find n number of places like this restaurant with this kind of ambience..!! Sitting was good n cozy with lot of tables..!! Good place for couples like college people to get cozy time..!! Music was a let down with very high volume nd poor selection of playlist..!! I cn play better music than their dj anyday..!! Food This section was a big let down. They always hv only 2 beer that too corona nd kingfisher..!! Kingfisher being their sour taste i didnt order nd when i ordered d corona as i hv no other option being their menu filled with soo many variety of beers, they brought normal means not chilled one.. When i asked them i want chilled they said they dnt hv any chilled one at this tym..!! Nd ordered a breezer with lemon flaver as they dnt have any other available..!! Another turn off menu..!! Then i ordered for mozzarella cheeze sticks and chicken steak sizzler. Sticks was good bt the sizzler was like they hv prepared in a hurry nd forgot to cook d chicken breasts properly..!! I wasnt able to cut d chicken even with d knife..!! Total waste..!! And they are charging like they r d only one lounge in whole delhi..!! Service I have given stars only for their service as i liked that..!! Staff was good and polite.. Haven't faced any problem in that section..!! Verdict Wont recommend this place to anybody..!! They shd work on their inventory first..!! Avoid nd u will find lots of good places in cp to njoy..!!",Rated 1.5,32,51,??

Too loud maybe as you cannot properly carry out a Conversation, nor you can really look at the food properly! :/ The food is good, they have decent Indian food, and the pizza n pastas were good. But the staff is little annoying, as I think due to the music, they wrongly take the order( happened twice)., also they keep looking at you,standing near u, even when u don't need anything.i.e. Annoying.

Shraddha Mahajan,"Rated Being my one of the fav spot in whole Delhi. i love hanging out there on my weekends. I loved their service, huge variety of food n yes, ofcourse their drinks menu. So, being one of its loyal customer yesterday I asked my boyfriend to catch up there. As he came to delhi for the first time and I wanted to take him to some cool place. This time I had worst experience at any club in my life. I had to call the waiters again n again to take our orders and due to loud music, Sometimes I literally have to stand up and shout to clear off the used dishes. Waiters are too delegating the work to each other. I asked a waiter to take away my drink glasses and bottle of empty beer. And he said he ll ask someone else to clear it up. I was like okay. But It took him more than 10 mins to send someone to clear off. So when i had high hopes with warehouse, it actually ruined my date. Won't be going there any longer.",Rated 2.0,1,4,??

Her Little Cookbook,"Rated How often do you go to Connaught Place (CP)? Work, meetings or just for shopping? Crowds of people, pollution and lots of nocie. Doesnt matter if you go there everyday or once a week, you know how exhausting CP can be. And here comes an amazing place which is an asylum from all of these: Warehouse Cafe As soon as the elevator door closes, you already feel relieved. Once you enter the restaurant its getting only better :). The interior design is very simple and looks a bit like a basement. In this case it is an advantage because it protects you from the chaos outside and takes you to a chill out zone. The ambience is created by a minimalistic number of decorations and focus on the comfortable & friendly atmosphere. The centre of the Warehouse Caf is a huge projector to display matches so that everybody can watch and enjoy it. Additionally there is a roof top with an amazing view for the Connaught circle and its huge Indian flag, and a separate room for private parties with space for up to 30 people. On a hot day you should try the Basil Cucumber Lemonade or the Kaffir Saffron Moctail which are cooling and refreshing. If you wanna chill in the evening and have some cocktails definitely try the Watermelon Mohito which is a very nice and interesting variation of the classic mohito. In the Menu you can find 365 dishes!! How comes? There are 12 pages in the menu, like 12 months in the year and every dish is assigned to 1 day of the year. One more cool surprise: Theres a differnet dish of the day for every day you come to the Warehouse Cafe. This one is being prepared with special care and youll get 50% discount on it!! As it is such a huge choice of dishes it actually wasnt that easy to decide which one we should try and it was a little bit confusing. On the other hand this calendar menu idea is very original and thanks to it everyone can find something to pick. Obviously we ordered the dish of the day which was Mushroom and spinach Dim Sum. Thin dough, folded like a perfect braid was first a pleasure for our eyes and secondly for our palate. Our other great choice came up to be the Pink Pasta with Vodka Sauce taste of fresh tomatoes with a bit of spiciness served with perfectly cooked penne. If you prefer something not spicy you should go for the Mushroom Leek Pie. Its delicate taste of fresh vegetables with creamy sauce will satisfy you for sure. You also wont be disappointed by the Steamed Fish Banana Leaf which was a melt-in-the-mouth feast. herlittlecookbook.com",Rated 3.5,32,199,??

Sukrity Wadhwa,"Rated Ohhhh I love this place. I've been there like 3-4 times and the experience has never been disappointing at all. I'll list out pointers for likes/dislikes that I have come across all this while: > Menu options are great but the day wise menu thing is little weird bkz more often than not I ended up on a dish that's not served on that particular day and I had to settle for something else > Food taste is just fine, a little better than the usual CP cafes but nothing very amazing > Hookah/Sheesha is awesome. One might find it a little over priced but it's totally worth it. They have some amazing flavours and their hookah is one of the best in Delhi > The cocktails are just too good. The Psycho Jack is my personal favourite. Such huge jar of cocktail and the USP is that its scotch based > The centrally located screen makes it a perfect place for match screenings > They have quite a number of beer options as well > They play good music, like the kind that will get you grooving and I often see people just getting up and dancing near their booth. Its too loud and the crowd just can't help it > The loud music doesn't let you have a conversation so not a place to hangout if you are in a mood to chit chat > Little pricey but my experience was always worth it so I won't complain One of the best cafes in CP but the high prices and way too loud music is what places it little behind on my list of go-to cafes!",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Simran Dhaliwal,"Rated So, I have been to this place a couple of times and this place definitely has a pull factor. Spacious yet a bit raw like a warehouse. Little too dim for my liking but offers comfortable big couches, all around. So once you settle down, you would have a good time. Music is good. Mostly, staff is attentive. USP: 365 dishes on its menu, one for each day of the year!! Needless to say, it offers multi-cuisine. And if you happen to order the dish of that exact date, you get a whopping 50% discount!! More than anything else, its fun ordering and trying to see how you could order the dish of the day. We ordered Veg Fajitas, Warehouse grilled chicken and peanut masala. While peanut masala could have been better, the veg Fajitas were an absolute no no. No flavours, had no texture, the vegetables and onions were overcooked and completely tasteless. However, our feedback to the chef did result in an absolute amazing result: warehouse grilled chicken. We loved it. Flavoursome and finger-licking. Chicken was perfectly cooked, had abundant flavours, the base of a mash potatoes and capsicum gave it a distinctive texture. The base perfectly balanced the top layer. I would definitely recommend you to try it when here... drinks again were just about okay, nothing great. Note: We went around 7pm. Place was relatively empty yet they were too fussy to let you sit anywhere. Told us the table is reserved and asked us to move. However, I little later someone I knw came and sat there and no one had any issues. Of Course, they had no reservation made. Grow up guys. There are better ways to handle customers.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Saurav Saikia,Rated On a hot sunday afternoon my friend and I decided to go to warehouse cafe. The first sight of the cafe was pretty good. The ambience was mesmerising though. We had ordered one warehouse spl veg pizza and chicken ham sandwich. The food quality was amazing but i felt the sandwich could have been much better. It was like a simple sandwich which you will get in any other cafe as well. In addition to this i felt the service was quite slow as i had to ask three times to bring our drinks asap and this also involves bringing the bill. I had asked one of the waiters to parcel the left over pizza slices but when i reached home i had realized that he had given me someone else's food instead of mine. This is where i feel the authority needs to be a little cautious of. Overall experience in this place was average and i hope next time these same mistakes don't happen again.,Rated 3.5,3,0,??

The place had very dim lights and good music with lively crowd. My personal favourite were crispy spring rolls and thin crust pizzas-Pepperoni and warehouse special pizza. Their Indian selection is delicious as well. Drinks were made tastefully-both hard and soft. Music is loud, not suitable for people looking to have a mellow time for some drinks.",Rated 4.0,61,36,??

Their menu is extensive and has 365 different dishes(matched with each calendar day). We tried thier Continental, Mexican and Italian dishes and all were good.

But the veg falafel with tohini sauce was a disappointment being a tad bit dry.. For drinks we got the Adams apple which was again good..

Arpit,"Rated After reading lots of review it was in my list. So finally go the chance to go. Ambiance : it was Dark , not much crowd and loud music. As it was a dry day so no drinks. Gap between the two tables were less which I find uncomfortable. Staff : the service was okie . I believe if a customer is sitting , the restaurants should have a courtesy to serve water whether its asked or not . Food : we ordered Punjabi pizza and switch to north Indian food . the quantity of gravy was good. Pizza was square shaped havely loaded with vegetables and paneer. Base was crispy and thin. I would say ordinary pizza nothing new Overall food was okie nothing special or new in taste. A good place to hangout with ur frndz",Rated 3.5,47,803,??

Heard people complaining about the music, but I liked the loud music, it went well with the bar theme. Also, the food here is really good. I ordered pasta, and it was delicious. The less lit up feature of the restaurant seems like a good idea. Some people like privacy and goes with the overall theme amazingly. It was a value for my money and staff was very courteous.

Only rating 1.5 because of ambience & the food serves was tasteless there was a bit of smell coming from the wings. If talking about makhani penne it was way too bad. I have tried the same penne at Big Yellow Door the prices were reasonable and taste was super awesome, but over here at Warehouse way too bad it was. Shakes were just normal.

After a great deal of persuasion, we got the table we liked. The so called reserved tables were vacant even when we left, three hours later. Coming to food, it's good but the portion size is small. The drinks menu is very restricted and price remains on higher side. Somehow we felt duped as even after 4-5 drinks each, we were not even high. Ultimately we paid for drinks but came back sober, which was disappointing.",Rated 2.5,8,3,??

Sajat Kumar Jain,"Rated Great ambience, ample seating, good sheeshas and ok food. We had a few chicken starters and our server was clearly not well versed with the menu. He kept repeating the same 1-2 dishes when we asked him for suggestions and we therefore ended up deciding on our own. I normally prefer taking suggestions from the servers as i expect them to know what's their speciality (clearly not a case here). The sheesha we had was quite good and the attendant for that looked after us very well. Also it was a little difficult to catch hold of the servers which I believe is a problem a lot of restaurants are struggling to solve. I request the management to ask their servers to be a little bit more attentive (it took us a couple of repeat requests to just get a glass of water).

V Nikhilesh Paliath,Rated My Bar is our usuall choice for treats and Birthday parties. But this time we thought we would try something different and it was my first visit to Warehouse Cafe. The place looked good and the music especially turned me on. DJ had a good list on the spin. You can a see a very detailed Menu for food course but the cocktail choices aren't impressive. The bell pepper margarita did not have any tinge of spice/hot feeling which one would expect. Adam's apple mocktail was worth sipping. Mozzarella Finger-a starter was the dish which blew our minds off. Being a fan of cheese this dish gave us ecstacy. We kept the main course simple. I would rate this joint for its ambience and food variety and for the fact that they provide Hookah (fancy ones as well).

But then they somehow managed to find us a corner which was dingy and completely left out from the rest of the place...right beside the restroom area. And that was not all. Look at the pictures attached. The couch was not well maintained and had an inch wide holes in it. So much so for the table occupancy ! When asked about another table, we were told that it's meant for 4, a rule which was completely forgotten and ignored as soon as a couple walked in. It's hypocrisy of the highest order. And that's not all. While paying for the check, we had let the steward know about our disappointment and displeasure. Yet he had the audacity and shamelessness to pitch for gold membership cards worth 3k (must have been a part of his target) when we clearly told him that we would not really consider visiting again. He wasted another 10 minutes of my evening. A complete failure from the service marketing and service delivery perspective. They could learn a thing or two about hospitality.",Rated 1.0,4,70,??

We ordered the Warehouse Grilled Chicken which is supposed to be their speciality but the presentation was horrible and the chicken so hard that it literally took me 5 minutes just to chew up my food properly. The sheesha was unnecessarily expensive for its quality - I can get better ones at Prince Paan at half the cost.

There's a lift to take you to the first floor at the entrance itself. Upstairs, the second floor has outdoor seating that affords a magnificent view of the sweep of Connaught Place. It also has a private lounge area for small groups. The music is the main feature of Warehouse Cafe: it is less distracting in the day time and more assertive at night. The guy who served our table informed us that the area really was a warehouse that has been given a makeover. Saturday nights are buzzing... couldn't find a place to sit at all but the ambience and music was so good that we dint want to leave. We tried chinese, italian and continental dishes and all of them were outstanding except the chicken burger which was a bit dry. Drinks are bit expensive but food is awesome, especially thin crust pizzas n pasta varieties and even Indian food they are serving is so authentic.

I found the taste not so extraordinary. It was followed by the drinks and trust me, you might want to check them out because they were out of this world..!! The very first sip of my Nutella and Hazelnut shake blew me away and it was quite delicious. :) Next was the pizza and to my surprise the it was actually square in shape!

The Virgin and Ginger Mojitos were both delightful. It was kind of full that night so it took them around 30 minutes to serve us. We ordered a vegetarian platter which had a variety if really good kebabs and tikkas which we feasted on. For the main course we ordered penne pasta and some quesadias which were both really good.

The server took us to our table, it was pretty much occupied. Bored of the same menu I asked the server as to what they do best. He offered me a pizza which was the specialty of the day for which we agreed. Next came the drinks I ordered for a cosmopolitan and some house drink. The pizza was amazing chef at the back did a real grt. Job. The drinks were not that great both of them. It had so much of concentrated lime juice that it killed the drink. Moreover other thing that was observed was the staff was abusing very loudly near the side station which was clearly audible even in such loud music condition.

However, to start with, I don't really like the ambience of the place. It has a very dingy look. But the music there is nice. Coming to the food, I tried their Oreo Shake, Virgin Mojito, Chilli Paneer and Pepperoni Pizza. Didn't quite like their Oreo Shake; had much better made ones at many other places. The Virgin Mojito and the Chilli Paneer were really good! The Pepperoni Pizza too was quite nice but they seem a little stingy in putting the topping. However, overall was quite a good experience. The pricing is a little on the expensive side though. Service was decent.

Neha Singh,"Rated Warehouse Cafe has been a favorite amongst all my friends since it opened around 2 years back . Visited this place again last week after quite long and I m really glad their quality is intact . The place is located at first floor in inner circle of CP , D Block . The moment u will step out of the elevator which takes u to the first floor you will be really amazed as it is way way way toooo huge . I cud not believe such a huge space lounge cud be opened in CP which is already jam packed with other restraz n showrooms . The place is very dimly lit even in day time and had huge leather sofas and wooden tables . The interiors somewhere justify the name warehouse....with interiors being done little bit like warehouse only. They have 2 floors plus outdoor sitting too (which is mostly full).On the weekends I would recommend to make a reservation in advance otherwise you will find waiting here always. We started with drinks and ordered cosmopolitan , LIIT , pina colada (all cocktails) and Kesar Kaffir Lemonade (mocktail) ....all of them perfectly made except pina colada whose taste I dint like as it was a combo of milk shake n alcohol. The vodka shots we ordered were not diluted like I have experienced in most of the other places. For the food we ordered , warehouse special veg pizza - a must have here ; Penne Arrabiata - which had no salt in it at all and so was not up to taste ; chilly panner - spicy and quite authentic ; veg salt & pepper- my fav here , a must order (I have ordered it every time I have visited here) ; Tandoori veg platter - a big disappointment ...always knew it will be ...who order a Tandoori platter in a place like warehouse except my stupid buddies :D The staff is very cordial here and will help you decide ur menu giving their inputs too. Service is quick too. This place will be expensive for ur pocket as it is on the high end. Btw.. They offer 50% off on the dish mentioned against the present date :D (they won't tell u that ...but they do give ;) ) Overall ....a nice place ... One can enjoy more if you go in a big group of friends :) MUST VISIT !!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Riddhima Sharma,"Rated So it was sunday and i decided to visit this place with a friend. I had heard alot about it. But unfortunately the place was a major turn down for us! Firstly, the seats actualy make you feel like a warehouse!..the upholstery was rugged and torn ( i presume it was due to hukka ashes or so) with holes in it. Secondly, the service was beyond worst!..we had to get up every time and call somebody to our table. I don't know if the attendents were lousy or couldn't hear us due to extremely loud music. But service was a major turn down! The food was okay..we ordered warehouse special pizza and dahi kebabs. The taste was fine but the food was cold when served at our table. At the end it was a waste of time and money for us! Since we did not order any non- vegetarian food or hard drinks. So i can't comment on that note. Perhaps, this place could be better for people who prefer hard drinks n stuff. All in all i won't visit this place again nor would recommend it to anyone.",Rated 2.0,6,12,??

Aninda Bose,"Rated WHC is more of an experience than just eating in a Cafe. The small entrance to the place in the inner circle of Connaught Place will surprises one after moving inside. It is very spacious; the seating places are big and comfortable. The loud music and dim lighting will take little time to adjust but the whole place looks beautiful after one settles down. The ambience is just perfect for a pleasant time and happy meal. The menu is quite innovative and designed in the form of a calendar with one meal a day. Totally, there are 366 dishes with good variety. Although I am a teetotaller but as per my friends the spread of alcoholic drinks served here is good. The mocktails are pretty innovative. The food is not extraordinary but quite good and enjoyable. The salads with mix of seafoods is really nourishing and tasty. One can try anything from the menu as food is well prepared and fresh.

Chainita Rawat,"Rated I have been to Warehouse cafe couple of times ,but didn't review it before. Reason being I found this place bit over hyped. Although it's a nice place that attracts crowds in huge numbers during weekends ,I didn't find this place particularly really attractive or inviting . The menu of this place is somehow nicely planned , which means that it's according to the months on the calendar and full of dishes . I found this thing particularly nice and also they have a whole good range of beers . But somehow the day I visited they didn't really had most of the beers that were on the menu ,this was slightly off but ya happens . Moving on to food , food was nice . We ordered Pasta ,chilli chicken and Enchiladas. Their pasta and chilli chicken were no doubt good. But their Enchiladas on the other hand turned out to be bit disappointing . also the amount of time that they took to get the food on our table was way more than my patience levels . For some reasons the music that they were playing was equally annoying.And as it got past 8 pm ,the place started getting flooded with people and the waiters no more cared if we wanted any more drinks . So went to the bar,asked for the drinks and those drinks reached our table only after a good delay of 20mins. So you gotta have a really good patience with this place starting from standing in the queue to get it ,to get food ,and to get drinks, etc. Go only if you have enough patience and free time to spend :)",Rated 3.0,102,234,??

And the burger too was outstanding, not dripping mayo and not dry either, could relish the taste of lamb in it nicely. And the chutneys served with burger made it a sensation.

Akshay Gupta,"Rated Was excited to visit this place but it didn't live up to our expectations. The ambience was fine, dim lit. The music was very loud and repetitive at times so was kinda annoying.

Mukul Gupta,Rated As the name goes i has a interior similar to it with a not so overwhelming menu considering the price they ask for them.

Manika Garg,Rated A place that will make your mood the moment you enter. good Interiors and nice music. We made a reservation before visiting. The place wasn't very crowded it was a Friday night. The staff was not so friendly . Can't say that they were rude but they weren't humble as well. Food Menu has different varieties but lacks taste. Place is just good for having a drink or 2 but not food.,Rated 3.0,19,148,??
Dr Ashwani Mehta,Rated Went to ware house cafe for lunch. As you exit from the lift you see a long bar(really long ) and then enter a slight dim lit area. It a large restaurent. Industrial decor with different seating area. Gives a good vibe once your eyes get used to the lighting. For non smokers the aroma of sheesh is a little bother. The service quick and friendly. Ordered a margarita tex mex veg burger and can not resist a mumbai bada pao when ever it is in the menu. Both decent and drink was well prepared. The informal nature of the place is inviting. Great music playing it was a good afternoon spent. The aioli and other sauces were good too. A place surely to visit again.,Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Aayush Parihar,"Rated It is a good place to hangout with your friends if you are around the CP area. They have like 3 floors of seating, with the top floor being a terrace seating overlooking the CP Circle. The views in the evening are worth a watch. Coming back to f&b, their menu has a vast variety of 365 dishes and undoubtedly delicious too. But the food and the drinks are a bit overpriced. The happy hour timings do not offer a ""one plus one"" offer, rather they claim to serve the drinks at a lower price. Barring that, definitely a place to visit!",Rated 3.5,34,124,??

All you see is waiters all around, the moment u raise your hand for service they rush to you. Little overpriced when it comes to drinks. But all in all you don't mind paying them that amount for giving you a great experience. Stretched upto three floors with an option of outdoor seating, this place never runs out of vacant table.

Prateek Bagri,"Rated Establishment is in the inner circle, Connaught Place. This is a great place, with meters of space. Elevator takes you to the first floor and the door opens in front of the bar. Sitting section is behind and the overall demeanor of place is a nice. Dim lit with nicely spaced tables and booths. Menu was complicated. Traded simplicity for trying to make place more hip and appealing; it took me a while to handle and order from their bulky calendar styled menu. Food was good and service was responsive; a friend spilled some beer and people were quick about it, but it is not the most ideal place to socialize IMO. Over the top loud music in sitting section was a BIG issue with me. It makes me claustrophobic. The music was so loud that my friends and I had to walk up to each others ears to communicate which after a while became a hassle. We were forced to sit awkwardly throughout our drinks. We had to leave to continue somewhere else. I wish they could bring down the loudness by a notch, tweak their menu and make items and drinks on their accessible, I'd gladly visit it again.",Rated 3.0,18,139,??

Sumit Chhabra,Rated So after reading trillion reviews I finally made it. We took terrace table as weather was nice after rain and view of cp while dining was amazing. The music inside was too loud and ac was too chilling. The food is good not very good I must say and definitely quality can be improved if they want. Little bit over priced and service boys were good but food service itself took lot of time. Even a bucket of beer took around 5-10 min.

Mayank Gupta,"Rated I have been to this place many times. Earlier this used to the best cafe in cp and gained a lot of crowd attention due to which you had to wait for atleast 45mins on weekends. But with coming up of many similar cafe in cp , now you can easily find a place here and the good part is they haven't deteriorated their standards with time. The ambience and decor is really up market. Comfortable couches with appropriate size of tables according to the seatings and well planned to maintain your privacy. Veg quesadillas is a must try here and is the best among i have tried in any other cafe. Tortilla was very fine and nicely done filled with a mixture containing cheese served with chopped spicy onions and tomatoes and mayonnaise which turn up into a mouth watering quesadilla exquisitely presented. To my surprise Dal makhani was very delicious and the serving was enough for 4 pax. I have also tried paneer tikka, chilli paneer and white sauce pasta and nothing was disappointing. They have a wide variety of premium cocktails and liquor which you may not find in many cafes. Sheesha was also very smooth. And the best was that we didn't had to remind them for the relights. The attendant were welcoming and well informed about the items on the menu. Earlier I used to have complaints regarding their service but my last visit changed my opinion. They have really improved on their service or may be because they had less people to manage last night. You may wish to see the prices before ordering as this place will hurt your pocket .

Today I decided to check out one of the restaurants and I came across Warehouse cafe and it said on their board ""Happy Hour"" and ""the biggest cafe in CP"" so I didnt hesitate to walk in. It was visually pleasing cafe and like they advertised the space was huge. It was very dark in there like walking into a nightclub and music was bumping. We ordered pitcher of beer and chicken stroganoff the food was great and draght beer was fresh and cold.

Chirag Takker,"Rated One of the best lounges in CP! You just have to visit this place. They serve one of the best hukkah in CP and have a wide range of drinks and dishes to offer. I went there on a Friday night, it was Bollywood night and had a wonderful time. The band that was playing was excellent, dhinchak Bollywood songs along with heavy beats just made our mood. To add to that was amazing speaker quality of the place. Though there is less space to shake your legs, but whatever little space we got, we really enjoyed dancing thanks to the amazing music and superior speakers. So if you just want to chill, have couple of drinks with friends and unleash this is the place to be.

Chingri Zimik,Rated The only plus points for the place is the music. A dance floor in the middle of the cafe would have been perfect. Service was bit slow and the place is packed most of the time. Nice ambiance and food is okay ( 2.5 out of 5). I guess the place is fun for a group to hang out and the Hukka is a cool thing. I did see some customers drinking who looked too young to be 21 :).

Tarun Aggarwal,"Rated For me this place is over-rated, ok types. Service is too slow and quality of food is also ok.

Jayant Sinha,Rated Loved their cocktails and appetizers. Food was not the best for the price but good.

Kanika Bhatia,"Rated Okay so you call yourself warehouse, but you needn't be a warehouse 13 starrer to be literal honey. I have been here twice, first time I am in love courtesy the terrace and the view. Second time I love them for a good tasting session I am invited to. But that doesn't bias my opinion here. A tasting session definitely needs more connectivity among the participants, that's how a critical assessment of the place and what you put on my plate is possible. Otherwise it's merely a half free dinner. Also as I mentioned to the organiser/management, the standard potion size might not be the best way ahead in tasting as it leads to a lot of waste in the process. Otherwise I am forever grateful :p In terms of dinner we went for the Penne Caprese and spicy chicken dumplings. Penne sorted the light flavouring demand while the dumplings satiated my carnivorous temptations. In terms of cocktails we tried the pia colada, kaafir lime and basil lemonade. The bar chef went a little too strong in lime for my taste, however each to his own right! The dessert tasting ended with tiramisu and bitter chocolate mousse with Oreo crunch. The food was a great satisfaction, I couldn't complain. Servers were attentive, management on its toes. But the event organising team could use introductions and involvement to solve the whole purpose behind the idea.",Rated 3.5,158,819,??

Ankur Agrawal,"Rated I have visited this place a few more times before, but this time holds my special attention as it was an Invite for an event called as "" Cocktails and Desserts"" I started with my favourite Mojito known as Mixology, and then tried their bourbon based cocktail, the Psycho Jack. The cocktails were great in appearance and well presented, although I must say it took them a little too long to get the order. Psycho Jack was a perfect blend and the bourbon's taste could be well differentiated too. As a rider to my drinks I had ordered a Pepperoni Pizza, a square pizza which was delicious and thin crust. For desserts I indulged into a Chocolate Mousse and a Tiramisu. I must say it was the best Tiramisu I have ever had as it had a perfect coffee flavour along with the rest of the flavours.

Every small thing, may it be filling of empty water glasses or clearing left over coal in hukka, it was observed and attended voluntarily by his team. The steward to table ratio is great, so that every table gets a personalized service. ""Guys, it was amazing evening experience. You will see me again ... Very soon""",Rated 4.5,5,38,??
Sumanyu Jain,"Rated We were invited for a Dessert and Cocktail tasting session at Warehouse Cafe. Having already heard of the place, there was no doubt about the quality of service and the ambience it provides. A separate section on the first floor was reserved for the foodies in this invite. We were very well welcomed and directed to our place. After some time the organizers confirmed our attendance as per the guest list. There were around 15 people for the tasting. For cocktails, we ordered A mixology- cranberry and vodka and a classic margarita (batch type tequilla). The first one was really good. In mocktails, we had one Adams Apple. Excellent drink. For desserts we had one red velvet cake and Triple Chocolate Brownie followed by Banoffee Cheese cake and Tiramisu. Red Velvet and Banoffee were the best of the lot. But overall the dessert menu was really delicious. We were attended well by the waiters and service time was okay. There's really no need to comment about the overall look of the place yet again. Great Bar set up too. Thank You to the organizers for inviting for the session. Looking forward for more such opportunities in the future. Cheers! Tanya Jain",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The inside sitting ,though with very dim lights is huge in area. It's been a great experience every time I have come here. The menu has a wide variety and very uniquely charted out day wise menu I.e for a particular day of week the dish listed under it would given discount on billing. The happy hours give 1 on 2 drink in imfl and one on one for domestic drinks.

Prashant Mantri,"Rated Bang in the middle of CP, this cafe has a distinctive setting. As there name suggests, everything they have like the ambiance, menu terms have something related to typical warehouses. Even on a weekday this place is packed with people coming over for a quick beer and a hookah. They have a happy hours menu at discounted rates. Their food-calendar catches the eye and food item mentioned on the date of your visit has a discount on its price. They also have a small buzzer on the table that have order, bill, service etc buttons on it, although I am not sure it it works. They have places to sit for 2, 4 and 6 as well as a couples section.

Vivek Abhinav,"Rated Though this place has earned a lot of love, but to give a better insight, let me tell you that they have for sure degraded their quality of food. I have visited this place about 4-5 times, but the experience on Sunday left me disappointed. You get awe-struck with the interiors, the ambience and the electrifying atmosphere. Needless to mention about the amazing view one gets from the terrace. But, ambience and nice view does not take care of your hunger. I, along with a friend of mine went there on Sunday, only to get a horrible experience. The staff attending us was not interested in his job. To being with we could not manage to get fresh juice, even when the temperature was soaring at around 45. We ordered Ceasar Salad, Tandoori Mutton Tikka and Lamb Sizzler, after finishing a very low quality cranberry juice and no so good Capuccino. The only thing we liked was Ceasar Salad. Mutton tikka was not cooked properly and the Lamb sizzler was so pathetic that we left it after just a bite. I feel this place is good for those who love their drink while having a nice view of CP. We left disappointed and cheated. The service was poor with the staff having almost no knowledge about the dishes on the menu. I will re-think to visit this place again as CP has better options in terms of food.",Rated 2.0,1,0,??
Shefali Rattan,Rated Went there for a friend's birthday. The entry is through an elevator. The ambience is dark and little shady for me. Music is too loud which is a turn off.

Yash Shah,Rated I usually am very liberal when it comes to ratings...but warehouse has been a big disappointment on several counts. I have visited this place thrice on different days and times...and i doubt ill be going there again. Cons 1. Music is not tolerable. I have a taste for various genres but this is just bang bang bang thud thud and honestly gives you a headache after some time. Its not good enough to be heard but loud enough to block conversation. 2. Seating is VERY uncomfortable. If you are a couple you would prob sit on a clunky sofa milesss apart to hear each other...the big couches feel as though ur sitting on a stone. Only somewhat comfy space is the square enclosures towards the top left. 3. Food taste is mediocre and helpings are meagre. 4. Staff is not very courteous and just moderately welcome. Pros 1. Ambience is good. Bar counter looks niceeah. 2. Terrace is worth the time on a breezy day.,Rated 2.5,7,54,??

Order it without a doubt. Add your Cart with Red Thai Chicken Curry served best with fried rice/noodles in your choice. Also, city's coolest menu style. Enjoy tge feast with discount on that very peculiar day. For all prawns lover, try thr prawns with Xo sauce. It gets so difficult to have such lovely sea delicacy when not being a next to shore city. For veggies, Fajitos are well served also tge number of mushroom options is a good thing to have. Finish your meal with the velvet cake, possibly the best sweet tooth thing and also multiple sundaes help very well in this regard. D block it is. Odeon Pan is around too.",Rated 3.0,2,0,??

I liked their spread of beer specially because they had many available. Although I am still a little disappointed that they didn't have Stella and Hoggaden despite them being in the menu. I would have given 4.5 but I didn't like any of the food items. I ordered nachos, jalepano rolls and crispy chicken. The chicken was hard from inside and rolls cold.

I have Mr. Vikas's visiting card and I have been trying to get in touch with him since the past one month. He has been declining my calls ever since. This incident took place on April 17th. I am a regular at Warehouse and I like the food and drinks served there, but ever since the incident I haven't visited again.

Ambiance 3/5. Coming to food and service. Service - Good, 4/5 (one deducted for not service water), Food- 3/5 - starters I tried were Mushroom kurkure (not good, dominating taste of capsicum), Warehouse Murg tikka (slrrpp..yummy), Chicken with BBQ sauce (sweet, not my preference bt different taste).

Seating is with bar chair tables in the center and reserved sofa sections around the corners of place. Walkins gonna get tables only. With company of 4 we ordered drinks. We gave the order for drinks, food and hookah. Things came up on time. Chicken and mutton starters were delicious. Service was excellent. That night we got a instrument music performer who played diff instruments on dj songs. It was dope environment. Crowd was awesome. Place is little bit expensive when it comes to pricing. Still money was well spent. For gang outing this place is best for weekends!",Rated 4.0,11,28,??
Prekshi Arora,"Rated I visited the place last year and was quite impressed by its ambience and decor. To start off with food, it's dahi k kebabs are palatable. The portions are a bit less.

Kunal Shaw,"Rated I have been here couple of times and undoubtedly this place considerably has done well with the food it serves. The only bone of contention for me to be a frequent visitor to warehouse has been its pricing over its food. I personally feel, the prices are mismanaged to quite an extent. For instance, a palate of French fries with cheese nowhere deserves to be priced around 300. Although the quantity and quality is not compromised. The ambience befits it's very name ""cafe"". A good choice of both indoor and outdoor rooftop sitting.",Rated 3.5,15,46,??

Aviral Bajpai,"Rated Placed in the inner circle of CP, as you walk to the entrance, you'd picture a small congested restaurant with crowd tossing you around. Enter the elevator and hit the 1st floor button and you'll know that it literally is as big as a warehouse. The place is simply amazing! The ambience they've created and the size of that place would surely make you laugh of what you were expecting out of that place. Right when you enter the place, there's this huge bar that you see adorned with drinks. And as for the brand, you name it! They'll have it. We sat in the lounge and it was modern. Now the reason I say modern is because nobody likes to shout in such a crowded place to call for a waiter. What they have for you is a remote buzzer on each table with multiple options to call the waiter for your table to trigger different things you'd like to get assistance for. Like water, bill, order etc. When it comes to the food, the pizza punjab da, the chilli chicken, mix veg fried rice and nachos were a few things we ordered along with a Pan Hukkah. The nachos were disappointing as the cheese froze as we ate them and the seasoned coriander messed up with the taste. As for everything else, it was pretty good. The pizza is a must try. Crispy crust with Indian masalas coming from Punjab as the name clearly shows. The sheesha was pretty good too with the coal providing good and dense smoke for long. The music might seem loud and it wouldn't be the best idea to take a phone call there but it goes well with the mood. The service was pretty good and the remote buzzers concept is an idea executed to perfection. All in all, if you're anywhere around CP and you're hungry, Warehouse Cafe is the place to be.",Rated 3.5,8,19,??

Coming to the food, they have a big menu as per calender days. The food quality and taste is pretty nice and stisfying. The names of the deserts are a but wierd, example-"" bhains ki aankh"" which will actually be a vanilla ice cream with brownie. So its worth trying any ine of them.

Orin,"Rated I'm giving this establishment a 2.0 rating only because of that cool gadget they have on the tables you can press a button on to ask for service. Warehouse Caf is your regular Shisha lounge for ""cool"" kids to take pictures at to fill up their Facebook albums. Food : Ordered Beef Fry and Basil Tomato Pesto Panini. The only semblance of flavour in the beef fry was the chilli, which was too spicy, and that wasn't mentioned in the menu. The basil in the Panini existed only in the menu, the filling being plain shredded chicken rolled in Mayo. Drinks : One pitcher of beer served at a temperature right when the taste starts to die, with half the glass foamed up. Ambience is that of a shady rundown bar. Lights are way too dim to find your way around. Horrible house music played at a volume only a step down from supersonic. Conclusion : Wannabe. I don't know what caused me to stay and place an order. It may have been the tiredness from walking all around CP.",Rated 2.0,2,13,??

They have a calendar based menu and you can get a 50% discount on the dishes mentioned for the particular day. The food tasted decent but the portion size was a bit less.

The cafe is dimly lit. The food and drink options are decent. We ordered penne alfredo and mushroom galouti, along with a mocktail called adams apple and a blackberry breezer. The pasta was nicely cooked and the sauce was rich. I would give it a decent 7/10. The bread slices accompanying it were not at all good. The bread was very hard and lacked flavor. Mushroom galouti kebabs were amazing. They were cooked to perfection and just melted in the mouth. They were served with green chutney and onions with vinegar. The mocktail (adams apple) was very refreshing. Overall, the food and drinks were satisfactory. The best thing here was, undoubtedly, the service, which was very prompt and quick.

ALPO,"Rated A friend and I visited this place for an afternoon beer and lunch. The location is perfect, just overlooking CP, but finding a place to park was a chore. Upon entering, I was overpowered by the sickeningly sweet lemony smell of some sort of deodorizing agent, and it took a few minutes to come to terms with that. We decided on Corona as the beer of choice for the afternoon, and settled down with our brews. Tandoori chicken and a veg platter followed, and we tucked into a well prepared sample of veg starters, and tandoori chicken which was tender and perfectly cooked. This followed by beer, followed by a shisha, followed by more beer, and for lunch I ordered a tenderloin steak and asked for it to be done medium rare. My steak when it arrived was closer to ""medium well"", and certainly was no ""Tenderloin"", and looked to be a cut of meat which was larger than any ""Tenderloin"" I have seen anywhere! I was good meat which would have turned out a lot better if it had been cooked ""medium rare"" as I had requested. The beer had made me ravenous, and I quietly consumed the steak without complaint.",Rated 3.0,339,635,??

We didnot made any reservation so had to wait for 10-15 minutes at the bar table. But i must say Pub manger or whosoever was allocating the table were quick to offer us a nice table (thnxxx). Ambiance - probably one the best deco i have ever seen. Dark with yellow lights, wooden walls with photo frames,Nice chandeliers on bar roof. All in all i liked the ambiance of the pub which in no time set the mood for the Party !!! Music - They play all house music so dont expect Rock or hindi tracks. DJ was a toddler anyways Sound systems was good so we made our mood to dance n enjoy :) Drinks - We had Budweiser Beer, Blackdog whisky, Kaproska, LIIT. Drink quality was good. Food - We had Bolognaise Pizza which was served in square wooden plate.Pizza crust was soft, cheese n minced meat was Heaven. Then we had chilly chicken ans sliced chicken n both were sumptuous. We also had mint n apple flavor Hookah n it added Flavoured smoke in our Party. Service- again i must say all the stewards were cordial n always had a smile in face. Service was quick too. Price - For all the above food,drinks,hookah mentioned above we paid just 6.3k which i think is a very decent bill for a amazing pub like this. All in all its a must visit pub.Tip - order your drinks in Happy Hour which is till 8pm. Suggestion - Just get a crazy DJ and i would rate the pub 5 Cheers !!!",Rated 4.0,105,119,??

The menu was calendar themed with many dishes and then dere was a big drinks menu and variety of hukkas. Ordered chilli chicken which was better than most places ( too tasty to be served in a lounge actually) .. Place is crowded sometimes soo getting a place to sit is difficult but its worth the wait.

The service was a little lax and the waiters had to be repeatedly called before they heard us but that could be attributed to the rush hours.

We happened to visit the place on a friday evening and were seated in their outdoor area. To begin with the staff although very patient and courteous seemed to be a bit confused. There were more multiple occasions when the staff mistook our table for other tables. The food was a big letdown. We ordered dahi ke kebab, pepper corn cheese rolls, ceaser salad and pasta Alfredo. The kebabs were a total disaster. Very hard, no taste of hung curd , it seemed like normal aloo tikkis. The presentation too wasnt up to the mark. The cheese rolls though were fine. The salad was ok too. The pasta was again a pain point. The pasta was raw and when we tried to bring this to the management's notice there was resistance in replacing it. However after we insisted they did change it. But the fresh one wasnt too good either. Just slightly better. The taste was very bland and it didnt leave a good after taste. I am wondering how I have misses reviewing this place earlier as all my earlier outings here were brilliant. Hence Id like to give them a benefit of doubt here that it was prob one of those off days Id def not think twice if i were to go and be here again..... And so shouldnt you",Rated 3.5,50,176,??

Priyanka Gulati,"Rated It was a few months ago when I had been to Warehouse Cafe with couple of friends for lunch. The indoor ambiance was nice but we chose to go for the roof top seating(as it was a winter afternoon and it was not a bad decision! :) ). The food was above average, but I did not find anything exceptional about the preparations. Also, the service was slow. Go for it if you are willing to spend a bit extra and are looking for a cool place to chit chat with your friends! Ambiance: 3.5/5 Food: 2.5/5 Service: 2.5/5",Rated 2.5,1,29,??

Tanushree Srivastava,"Rated Fantabulous and splendid are not mere words to describe the awesomeness of this place. It never disappoints me on any level. Food: Menu is huge with a lot of offerings from salads to wings to pizza's to kebab's to pastas to desserts etc. Order anything on their menu, you wont be disappointed. Service is prompt and the staff is very courteous. The ambience is a creative mix of lounge , bar seating, restaurant and an outdoor setting. So you can even select a place to be seated according to your mood. Rooftop is awesome for the open space lovers like me and to add more to it you have the glorious Indian flag swaying with the wind, as the cafe overlooks the Park, - it's such a delight to watch. This place has everything to offer under one roof - Drinks, Food, Hookah and great music.",Rated 5.0,3,38,??
Pranav Gupta,"Rated Warehouse Cafe is basically a high end lounge located in Connaught Place. If you're going in for the drinks, it's a place you'll enjoy, only if one is ready to empty their pockets. We were a bunch of guys who went to the place and all we ordered were 2 Veg Platters and 4 Mojito's, and our total was 3500. The quality of the Platter was below average, hardly anything enjoyable to eat. The Mojito's on the other hand did have the perfect taste. As I said, a place good for drinks and hookah, not the food. The ambience of the place is great and they also have a rooftop seating. The place is quite big and there is usually a match being played on the screen or at night the sufi music is on. The songs which are played are all the latest pop songs, none of which you don't want to listen. On my second visit, we were only 2 people and we ordered one Ice Tea, a Cold Coffee and one Chicken and Cheese Nachos. Again, the drinks were great and the bill was 950. So basically, warehouse is a great lounge where you can sit and enjoy your drinks and sheesha, but not the food, and it will cost you much more than you'll think it will deserve. For dates where you need some quality time and there is less eating and you need privacy, the place is a good suggest, but if you go in a group, it'll cost you more than double of what it will feed you.",Rated 2.5,18,114,??

The pizza, honey chilly potato and chicken wings along with the non veg platter we ordered were beyond amazing but yes, they definitely costed us a dime. The drinks no doubt were chilled and were at paar with what you can have at My bar.

Vandita_Roaming Gastronaut,"Rated The Warehouse Caf seems to be doing everything right since its opening, and a couple of years thereafter, they are still at the top of their game. I visited this place about a month ago and of course, chose to sit at the terrace. Who wouldnt want that in Delhis February weather!..While on our way to the terrace, I got a chance to look around the place and they have a vast area to themselves, an advantage that restaurants in CP have. The sheer size of the place makes the very first impression in this case. The ambience sets the mood with dim lighting and foot tapping music. The fixtures, the seats, the color scheme, everything sets the mood. The terrace offers a brilliant view of the Central Park and the unbeatable majestic Indian Flag. This makes it my favorite terrace in the whole of CP! We were seated and given the menu by a very soft spoken and smiling man. Having a good server sets the ball rolling for a good meal and hospitality. We ordered Crispy fish chilli mustard, warehouse murgh tikka, mutton shammi kebab alongwith drinks. What I loved most about their dishes was the presentation. These starters that we ordered look generally unappealing on a platter coz of their color and texture. But the chefs played with colors in the salad that came on the side and jazzed up the dish. Everything was very well cooked. The fish was crispy from the outside and soft on the inside. The chicken tikka was succulent. The dahi kebabs almost melted in the mouth. All the dishes were spicy and had all the right condiments which gave them an amazing flavor without setting our mouths on fire. roaminggastronaut.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

NOW talking about food, the food was best acc to me. we ordered fish fingers with tartar sauce and non-veg club sandwich both were perfect. the fish fingers were crispy from outside and soft juicy from inside the club sandwich had whole set of different taste which were tantilizing my taste buds.. greetings were good but the service was very slow when we ordered the food it took a long time for the food to come other wise everything was just good from ambiance to food ,decor place except for the service and the very loud music overall i would rate it -4/5 thumbs up for having quick snack bite or just having good food and nice time",Rated 4.0,2,54,??

Malavika Kathuria,"Rated So my first impression of the place esp that of interiors were dark and dingy...however I insisted on a table in the open area and I luckily got one and I loved the fact I was sitting in the open in CP with a great view (at least from one side). I was quite excited to go to this place since I heard a lot about this and had even read reviews. We ordered a bonocconi salad, minestrone soup, pesto pasta, warehouse SPL pizza and fish. I quite liked the food though my friends didn't think too high of the pasta and the fish. It was too bland in their opinion. However all this would have been fine only if the staff would have been courteous. To our utter surprise the waiters were rude and misbehaved. The attendants were absolutely mannerless bickering about waiting the tables, insisting on sending the other on being called. We were told the ""price""of the hookah before we can think of ordering one which was highly overpriced. This all could still pass off as a bad day but they had terrible service and everything was delayed ...our salad was the last to reach the table though it was the first to be ordered as the order was not punched. Then they even made a mistake with our bill. Overall a very bad experience solely because of the behavior of the staff and their attitude. Because honestly the place is decently located and served decent food. I have never ever seen such arrogant staff who couldn't care less. There are tons of better places with pleasant staff and better food.",Rated 2.5,34,38,??

Anuj Dhamija,"Rated Since it was necessary to give at least one star, I had to do it. Though this place deserves zero stars (rating). Awful people, just below average food, rude staff. Service, in a dhaba is better than this place. We were four people and ordered some pasta, some pizza and the dish of the day (one out of their food calendar)... Not only the food took forever to get served, the staff was literally ignoring us every time were trying to call them. We took a table on the terrace and were sitting very close to the billing counter. Every time we tried calling someone, the servers used to discuss and argue amongst themselves over who should go. Moreover, these guys did not know which is the dish of the day and what is the discount that they are claiming to offer on the food calendar. Very bad experience. Never visiting this place again. They are wasting great space (awesome location in the heart of Delhi). Best, Anuj",Rated 1.0,1,36,??

We ordered so many things but taste was awful and they have put in a lot of salt in that. It was intolerable to have it , so we asked them to change it. After changing the dishes , the taste was still the same. Didn't liked it at all. Its a complete waste of money for me & my friends as we paid around 4000 and i haven't found it worth it.

Nikhil Aul,"Rated Not sure of how busy this place gets usually but I was here to watch the India Vs Pak Match and this place was packed. Infact, packed to the extent that service was lacking - Hence 4.0 rating otherwise would have rated the place higher. The calendar Menu is the coolest part, apparently whatever day you choose to visit this place (Unlike the match day, when they were no Happy Hours or Discounts) that day's food or maybe even alcohol is billed at 50% off the original price. Food: Menu is huge with a lot of offerings from salads to wings to pizza's to kebab's to pastas to desserts etc. Went with a group of 7 and ordered the following with varying quantities Mix Fruit Plate/Salad Chicken Wings Bacon, egg's from their Breakfast Menu Chicken Pizza Dahi Kebab Drinks Warsteiner Pitcher Kingfisher Pitcher Overall, Food is excellent, the portion size is good, the only disappointment was the Fruit Salad - could have offered some better varieties of Fruit. Price: Average Bar prices, might be pricey for the average spender. ROOFTOP IS AWESOME FOR THE OPEN SPACE LOVERS LIKE MYSELF.

The seating arrangement was good as thy had gas heaters which were an absolute necesscity. Due to bird flue scare I m avoiding chicken so I ordered mutton tikka along with a pitcher of a fast and furious which was very good along with house recommendation - phuket paneer . It was more like manchurian and was tangy however mutton tikka wasn't that good and it is avoidable since they have so much more to offer. Honey chilly potato was re prepared thrice (Don't know what was cheff occupied with) and finally when it arrived it was worth the wait.

Divya Nagpal,"Rated Warehouse Cafe, located in the centre of the hustling and bustling Connaught Place has slowly become one of the most popular places in the area. Though I wouldn't exactly call it a 'Cafe'. More of a lounge. Nonetheless. It's an absolutely huge place with two storeys of seating area and the terrace as well. They also boast of having the longest bar in Delhi. The ambiance is true to its name i.e a Warehouse. They have all kinds of seatings with some tables on a higher ground than the others. It makes the restaurant look even bigger than it already is. We happened to go on a Sunday afternoon and it was absolutely packed. The menu is in the form of a Calendar with one dish dedicated to each day of the year. So you can imagine the vastness of food served! The food here is quite good -nothing spectacular. Service is decent as well, given their style of service. The best part of the Warehouse Cafe is their terrace style seating. Grab a drink and head on that terrace.

Age ID Is a big problem so I suggest you all carry, every single person, yes that's how they roll. Someone who loves to dance should move to other places because upon dancing either they think we are too drunk even though we know how to handle ourselves when drunk and after having GREAT FINGER LICKING ICED TEAS AND FINGER FOOD, we paid the humongous bill and reserved a table to town house cafe.

The moment we entered, it was too dark with dim lights and the seating place was occupied by youngsters majorly. We were completely blown by the ambience. After having a tough time, we managed to find seats for ourselves. Regarding their preparation, we had mixed reviews. Firstly, the service is too slow. U need to follow up with d waiters time and again about ur order. And then when u finally feel happy that ur order has arrived, u ll be disappointed to know that only half of the order is delivered and d rest would again take ages to come. Coming to food, we ordered few items outa which veg and non veg platters tasted delicious. Both the quantity n quality was good. In d drinks menu, we ordered few types of mocktails, cocktails along with beer and grey goose. Cocktails were good, mocktails were just okay while grey goose was a big disappointment. They served Smirnoff or some other local/ domestic brand under its name. Heard that many restaurants do this but never expected this from warehouse cafe.",Rated 3.0,102,482,??

Evangelyne,"Rated I was on a layover in Delhi and decided to do a bit of Pub hopping. Was in Connaught Place and decided to hit a good spot and chill with a couple of drinks. Came here on Friday, grabbed a couple of beers and headed right outside. It was a beautiful fall day, perfect hoodie season (as it was supposed to be a casual spot, but there were ample of people just coming from work in work clothes). There is small narrow indoor portion with seats that leads to the bar and the outdoor area has ample seating for a small space. However, what sets this apart is the amazing view of the Connaught Place. It's also a bit more low key than many rooftop bars with the view so it's a nice cozy little place that normally isn't too crowded. The music also isn't that loud so easy to talk to friends and just a great place to catch up. Anyway, for what it's worth, it's an okay spot.

Visited Delhi for 2 weeks in December and went to many places and reviews shall follow. To begin with, Warehouse Cafe. Great location in CP and the highlight of the place os the terrace over looking the park and clutter of CP. The ambience inside is electrifying and I was amazed the number of people inside on a Tuesday evening. The drinks are great and the bar is long and elaborate. The menu is very well thought of and makes an impression. I found the prices on the higher side, but can be ignored considering atmosphere. We ordered the mixed kekab platter and it was fine.

Priyanka Singh,"Rated It was the first weekend of mine of 2015, and i really wanted to enjoy it thoroughly with my friends. So we chose""WAREHOUSE CAFE"" as our meeting point. It is there in Connaught Place. Since i was aware of the fact that prior reservation is actually recommended for this place because of its housefullness, i had already booked a table of four in advance. The place is beautifully done in wooden touch. Its interior and the decor has been curated keeping in mind the name itself of the place. Giving a proper rustic look of a typical warehouse with a dash of modern hint too, which can be easily seen right from the walls, the stairs and the roofs. They have ground floor comfortable seating with a huge bar area on the first floor which is followed by an open upper terrace seating. They have SHEESHA also to please their customers. Then we straight away went to the upper terrace seating which was pre booked, luckily the weather was also favouring our mood. We started our evening with the starters like Chilly paneer dry. Nachos Spring rolls Chicken Shawarma Mushroom Galouti Veg. Quesadillas & Orange Chicken salad Phuket fish. All of them were just wow. Perfectly done and great in taste too. They were followed by few drinks too. Virgin mojito Martini Adams apple Collins cocktail Virgin mojito in green apple flavour. Drinks were very refreshing too. Our evening was on its full charm. Everyone was enjoying the ambience and the food. After couple of hour's chat we ordered our main course, Chicken curry Dal makhni Veg. Biryani Crispy naan. Great meal it was all together. Dal makhni, to my surprise was the winner of the main course. Well, how a meal can be complete without having the dessert. So we selected Brownie wrapped in spring roll sheet as the one to end up our treat. It was so delicious that we asked for a repeat also. Not to forget to mention, the staff and the service of this place is quite quick and efficient. Their courteous behaviour is so appealing that i would like to give them 11/10. Very impressive. To conclude, i would say nothing could have been more better than this for celebrating my first weekend of the new year. A must try is highly recommended to everyone.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

At ground floor they just have a list the restaurant is at the 1st and 2nd floor with open sitting area on terrace. Its on an inner circle so from terrace you can get the complete view of central park with lovely view of our National Flag in Central park. This place is nicely designed with spacious sitting area and with Big TV screens running some sports channel, Loud music, dim lights presenting simply stupendous atmosphere. Food: we ordered spicy lamb and chicken pizza. They served thin crust nicely baked pizza which was amazing in taste. Service no doubt is very good.

The mix veg coriander dimsum, were ok, I have had better in smaller joints. The hummus with pita was nice however, Pita was fresh and hummus nicely done.

It was simply divine. Very soft and juicy. The second were the salad and phuket fish. They were also great. Phuket fish was very oriental. Salad had very soft big chicken pieces which made it a true value for money dish. To end with we ordered for a chocolate brownie which were wrapped in a spring roll sheet. Looks very creative but was the only dish which made brought my rating to 4.5 in place of 5. The only dissapointment i had. The service was also superb.

But still will always be found here. Ambience : Too good Be it, its furniture, lights , music (quality) but I would suggest them to lower down the volume a bit coz its always too much crowded and noisy and u jus can't listen to the person sitting next to u. Food: I just love the food served here. Be it , it's warehouse special pizza or Indian cuisine they are jus too good. And drinks are always a surprise to me.

Sudhanshu Wadhwa,Rated It was my birthday and a get together with one of my best friend and thereby I thought the place has to be a special one. So I chose Ware House cafe over Monkey Bar. One of my friend told that there is nice seating area on the porch. So we went there and asked the waiter to join the tables as we were group of 6 and a single table only accommodate only 3. The waiter straight away refused it. Finally after discussions we asked the girls to take the seats while guys were standing. I would rather say that the support staff was not at all helpful with the seating arrangements. On Wednesday evening it was 1 + 1 on IMFL and 2 + 1 on Foreign Beers.Food was average costly though. On an average I would say its a costly thing as compared to other bars and lounges in CP. Average cost for two would be 3000 Bucks. I would appreciate if the support staff are bit courteous and helpful. All in all we had fun and enjoyed though it costed us 18k. :) while proved to be a lil costly even during the Happy hours I don't know how come.,Rated 3.5,49,356,??

Sinchita Kar,"Rated Went to this place because I heard a lot about this place and its amazing ambience, so I thought why not celebrate the end of exams here? It's easy to find with a female outside standing and the elevator takes you right upstairs to the cafe. Decor: The ambience is lightly dimmed. With long and leather couches accompanied by short wooden tables. Unfortunately, we were not given the chance to sit outdoor as it was occupied by some ladies having a special kitty party. Nevertheless, we had the chance to sit right in front of the screen and sometimes watched the australia vs india cricket match. Their menu is basically in a calendar format. Staff: They are very corteous, and helpful. However maybe because of the crowd sometimes we had to call them few times to get the attention. Nevertheless, they did their best. Order: We ordered quite a few things from the menu, but the main course was mostly italian. We also ordered hookah. Chicken Strips: a tad dry, but well fried. Veg Seekh Kebab: nothing exceptional. The aroma of the fresh herbs was present however. Soft, but good enough. Chicken Alfredo: chicken pieces were quite plenty. Creamy and well made pasta. Veg Alfredo: not so cheesy as expected, but good enough. Chicken Lasagna: it was completely made wrong. It resembled like a Sheppard's Pie rather than a lasagna. It didnt have besciamella or cheese. I jst tasted lots of minced chicken. They should totally improve this dish. All pizza were thin crust. Pizza Margherita: thin crust, with flavorful mozzarella overwhelming the senses. Chicken Sausage Pizza: the chicken sausage was not evident when tasted. The chicken's flavor was completely hidden. Chicken Tikka Pizza: indian species that marinated the chicken made an effect to the taste buds to an extent. Good enough. Hookah: strong flavor. Well made! Chocolate brownie: it was very tasty. Awesome. They should try this! Chocolate Spring Roll with Caramel sauce: it was a great combination. Surely excited the taste buds. I liked it.

Jasmeen G Dugal,"Rated Though it was not my first time in one of Priyank Sukhija's restaurants and lounges across the Capital's culinary landscape, it was the first I visited Warehouse Caf in the heart of Connaught Place, for a formal review. From the moment my friends and I stepped out of the smartphone styled lift I perceived I'd entered into a dimension with the team's special combination of technique and soul.. with a industrial-chic look where a colossal bar takes centerstage.. with the focus firmly on the guests and the food and alcohol being served. For those who've not visited Warehouse Cafe you should experience it to appreciate why it's always packed whether you're having a quiet luncheon with family or cocktails and EDM music with friends post sundown! There is an air of luxury about the place, but it's affordable luxury, conveyed through the inherent richness of the food and celebration of the regions that inspired it. Once seated in a plush sofa while awaiting a table on the beautiful terrace overlooking Connaught Place, we perused the calendar-theme menu with a different dish for each day of the year! The menu is a distillation of eclectic influences and we ordered 'Warehouse Murgh Tikka' and 'Sarson Mahi Tikka' to go with chilled beer. The melt-in-the-mouth tikkas were seasoned and seared to perfection, releasing their juicy spiciness. Time flew by as conversation flowed and we headed up to the terrace an hour later where a nip in the air embellished the culinary experience we ordered 'Penne Chicken Pesto' and 'Pizza Indiana'. Both entrees were fabulous! Reminiscing about the evening, WareHouse Cafe offers a unique, interesting dining experience. Attention To Detail is keyright from the decor to the food quality, variety and flavour; the meticulous preparation and presentation; and the adept service. It all combines to create a memorable meal that's laidback and fun. Im sure it's going to continue its reign as a hotspot for diners and partygoers alike so Im heading back there soon aren't you?",Rated 5.0,98,1297,??

One of the best bar i have seen so far, hands down. The bar menu is huge. We were in a hurry and quickly ordered 2 tequilas. One was given complimentary. Really some good offers on the menu. They do serve alcohol cheap if one knows what to order. After a few chilled Heinekens, we left the place. But one of the best bars of CP for sure. The place serves everything so that you have a good time. The food menu has a item marked for each of the day of the year. Overall a excellent short experience. Will definitely visit again.",Rated 4.5,128,470,??
Geetanjali Aggarwal,"Rated Lovely rooftop with a great view..especially perfect for Delhi winters! I have always enjoyed the drinks there...happy hours from 12 to 8 should definitely be utilized here. Their food is interesting, delicious and well presented. Their hooka is expensive! One LIT and one large old monk(during happy hours) with one veg quesidillas and sheesha costed us Rs 3200! An expensive place to be honest...

Raool,Rated Considering that CP is one amazing choice of place whether its a Fine Dinning mode...Weekend Kick Start or Saturday night party or whether its a whatsoever kind of group reunion there is a good number of lounges and restro bar to choose from...WAREHOUSE CAFE definitely stands altogether as one with a different and much needed for CP richily stylished Lounge...there has been one from a long time although (QBA) but that is more appropriate for Fine Dinning and Warehouse cafe is more happening when it comes to Partying ambiance or Good Drinks with Loud music mode...where Warehouse drops numbers is when it comes to the taste of food...the Quality and presentation does keep up to the name but you realy need to introduce some experience with the dishes...One can get a much better American snack in a regular multi-cuisine restro and considering people dont have dinner a lot in lounges and rather choose a good snack with drinks you should upscale TASTE...The Lounge is somewhat loud on the pocket so not the best Value for money place in CP but it sure should be on a visit list among CP lounges...(atleast for the ambience and drinks),Rated 3.5,4,12,??
Sayan Banerjee,Rated A friend suggested this place for a Sunday after light lunch..but i was very very disappointed with the food. Two of us ordered a non veg club sandwich and a veg tex max burger and honestly both were sub standard... i make better club sandwiches at home!

Raul J Pacheco,Rated So after hearing alot finally went with a few friends. i really don't think i liked it and don't think its worth spending. Pretty pricey and i feel you could have the same quality of food and drink and still spend less elsewhere. ambience is decent although i don't get it as to why does it look shady and y all the dim light as if there's a dj set up and dance floor. Personally i found it expensive and the guys serving are always confused specially if its crowded(trust me i got alot of stuff i dint ask for not once but way too many times) Yet again this place still has the hype i honestly don't know why so do go there and if you find out let me know as well would love to give it a shot once again. NOTE:- only if i get a large number of reviews i shall give the so called shot again. All those giving me the reviews are most welcome to pay my bill as well.

Abhinav Saxena,"Rated Good place to spend quality time , ambiance is good we expect more out of food it's not worthy , service is extremely slow and wweekends could make you wait for 15 20 min to get a space there. Murg sagwala is a strict no. !!!",Rated 3.5,50,106,??
Abhinav Kashyap,"Rated This is what happens when you go to a place with high reccomendations, many of my friends have been asking to go and see this place as they all loved it but to me it's nothing like a warehouse. They tried to keep it rough though but haven't been able to do a better job so the first thing you would see in a warehouse is they don't have swanky elevators they have this grill gates commercial elevators to get stuff up and down, then once you reach up there is no one to guide you for table or ask you, to my surprise the place was full at it was 8:00 pm only all youngsters inside, so I was looking for a table so I asked a gentleman may I have a table or 3, you will have to get your name on the waiting list he showed me a guy and told me to get my name in the list with him so when I asked him to put my name on the waiting list he told me we have no waiting list haha what a confused management. So now Iam waiting for our table but suddenly a group of three people come in and they get the tables first see this is what happens when you run your show in confusion now I had to use my charm to us a table so I spotted a cute chubby stewardess gave her a warm smile and here she comes towards us and says sir how many of you are together I said we are three she asked us to follow her and here we have a table for us not bad, Ok now for the food and drinks. The menu is utter confusion for food stars with January goes till December but without making any sense of the calendar and dates you order anything it's on your own risk coz they have just written the name not the ingredients of the food and if u ask the steward you can't hear him as the music is too damn loud like you are in a discotheque bloody I hate cafe or lounges who play music at it's full blast you can't talk here you just can't sit here drink like stupid get high and go home no backad that's their policy. So we ordered a veg pizza and a grilled chicken. Drinks @ warehouse is something they boost too much about the concept here is you buy a bottle and consume it within a month so you save on some extra pegs. Beer they didn't have draught but it's in their menu. So you decide what you should have after consulting with the steward. Food was Ok not very good not very horrible can survive on it but I won't feast over here. Presentation was good. They have some daily promotional offers running with some companies you need to ask they will never tell you by them selves. So if you are in cp and you are looking to go to a new place which is swanky try them. And yeah an average per person cost is around 2600 with one meal I think it's OK. And please don't take anybody here if u r meeting for the first time",Rated 3.0,29,21,??

Akshay Kothari,"Rated Situated in CP, this very classy place is definitely worth a visit. Ambience - It's in CP, but the moment you enter the place, you'll be transported to a different place altogether. The crowd is good and so is the music. Food - Food and booze are good. I tried a pasta and a chicken starter. The Indian food is much better than the Italian. Service - this is where I'll have to deduct some points. The waiters were not very attentive and didn't really know much about the items listed on the menu. The menu wasn't very descriptive about the dishes either, which created a bit of confusion.

DEVEN MANSATA,"Rated Warehouse cafe.... It indeed lives upto its name... A huge place xactly like a warehouse... I Was stunned the moment i stepped into the cafe... Ambience is amazing.... Went tyere specifically for the outdoor seating... and was indeed amazed by the view... It overlooks the cp inner circle and the first thing your eyes see is the indian tricolor... Was little disappointed with the outdoor seating as they have accomodated a lot of tables.. Making it too cluttered... even walking between two table is difficult if all the tables are occupied. Food was amazing... But service was little poor... Waiters were inattentive... and day dreaming... probably evn they were enchanted by the view... We ordered two laphroaig and got the third one complimentary, thanks to the happy hours.. ""Grilled chicken and ratatouille bruschetta"" And ""bbq chicken strips"" Both were amazing but since didnt like the service we left just after the starters.

Nayantara Bagla,"Rated Been wanting to get to this place for a long time now. And the day I landed up, the kitchens were closed. My friend and I were patient and didn't say anything , so with our drinks we asked for chips, peanuts or any damn thing to bite on. All I got was a straight up no. How can a bar function without any munchies? Also I know what it's like to close a restaurant in the night and the hurry all we hoteliers are in but that does not mean you will take everything off my table while I'm still sitting there. Atleast ask man. And from my experience if there is even a single guest in a section it is rude to start closing up. We know we need to leave and we will no need to rub it in our faces. Another pointer: people hate it when you serve Pepsi instead of Coca Cola. It tastes shite with anything that is traditionally supposed to go with Coke. Do you want Monopoly money instead of the real deal? No right? So get me coke please. If it weren't for that incredible terrace I don't think I'm ever coming back.",Rated 2.5,59,441,??

Just a pretty exquisite entry for a eatery. Which takes you to another floor, and that's where the actual warehouse lies. It's one 0f those dim-lighted places, but I must say. Much better from those. It has that environment and crowd which makes it so. The calendar you get after you get seated is the menu by the way (whatta thought) ! Ordered a pizza. And Indian main course for a change.

It really has one of the most chic ambience, no doubts, you love the high seat, you love the sofa, you love the outside seating !! But it stops right there, the service sucked, the delay, the tone in which the waiters talked, the way the hukkah guy disappeared, the way they did everything. I was having a really good evening, the cafe i will say did nothing to destroy it, or lemme put it better, could have done nothing to making it bad, but they failed to make it great.

Rashi Midha,"Rated After its good reviews on Zomato, our friends (group of 8) decided to hang out at warehouse cafe last evening. We took seating at second floor. From there, issues started cropping up. We could see everywhere, they had place reserved tags on 6 seater & above tables. Our friends had slight issues on getting seats. But our group thought its Sunday, so seating could be a issue. Then we ordered: 1. Nachos 2. LIT Pitcher 3. Cold Coffee 4. Hazelnut Coffee 5. Veg Pizza 6. French Fries with cheese 7. Veg Spring Roll The entire food that was served was average. Nothing different. Presentation was good. LIT had zero kick and we could n't feel any hint of liquor. Our two friends joined us late, so we asked the staff to put 2 extra chairs. Initially they showed up slight resistance and then informed us they could give 2 chairs till 8 pm. The reason: space to next table would less and it would be cluttered. Who was on the next table: ONLY reserved tag, no guests. Next we ordered, Veg platter for the dinner. We place order around 7:50 pm or slightly earlier. They never showed up with the order. We waited till 9 pm. We were really pissed off. We had to continuously check with them and finally, we gave up. We paid our bill and left hungry. Guess, no guests showed up for few reserved tables. Throughout our stay, the staff almost never gave us water. We had to remind them to serve us normal water. Once we reminded, they served us. In the places like warehouse cafe, we go to hang out because of its ambiance and service. We pay premium price to average food because we will be served well and if we don't this service, then we are not happy and not going back.",Rated 2.5,78,571,??

Shivam Bindal,"Rated The only thing I liked about Warehouse Cafe was its Ambience and Seatings. I ordered a Red Sauce Pasta and it sucked really bad. That foul smelling pasta was no good at all, I had to sprinkle Oregano to disperse its smell. Moreover, someone's else bill was handed over to me initially.",Rated 2.5,6,83,??
Prayank Gupta,"Rated It is one of best place in Delhi to go out for drinks..It's a huge cafe, with different seating options..Prices are also on the higher side..They take Minimum Legal Drinking Age of 25 quite seriously..Music is good and loud, just the way i like it..Calender Menu is quite innovative..Good to go only during happy hours, otherwise drinks are very expensive. Overall recommended 4/5",Rated 4.0,48,217,??
Prabhat Abhinav Negi,Rated Now talking about the warehouse cafe. Went there a few times. Prompt service mostly and good ambience. Service could be better at the high chairs as all they seem to care about are the people coming in pairs or more. But all in all must go if you haven't been there yet.,Rated 4.0,4,28,??
Vikash Anand,"Rated Bombastic !! wonderful place to check in when u need some peaceful environment. The menu is full of options , there is descent ambience and select crowd.

Amit Yadav,"Rated When you enter the WC,it doesn't give you a nice vibe about it. The food was OK,one can actually get better food at one of the roadside vendor. The beers were served chilled,however there was something wrong with the whiskey which had an amusing taste about itself.",Rated 3.5,3,9,??
Sandeep J,"Rated Been here now quite a few times , so penning something . Rated as one of the most happening cafe' in CP and a big hit amongst Delhites with a calender menu which is quite expensive . Decent seating space with perfect decor and ambience , however , with a pretty loud music played in background leave you with limited options to chat unless you would want to try their rooftop which opens up an option of paying salutations to the biggest Indian Flag right opposite . Didnt quite like the attitude of staff who sounded errant and rude . Food and Snacks were above average and they would strictly NOT allow Children on weekends , so families might want to avoid this especially on Saturdays and Sundays . Cheers !!",Rated 3.0,12,24,??
Ishdeep Bakshi,"Rated A lavish menu. Nice deals on liquor . Comfortable seating arrangements .Most surprisingly there lamb and beef burger , simply amazing. The quality of meat and cooking was just spot on 10 points to the chef, Perfectly balanced. Nice Ambience , if you like loads music then it's great , if not then try and avoid it over the weekends. All in all a good balance of expertise.",Rated 4.0,19,39,??
Bharat Arora,Rated I have been to the warehouse cafe many times now. Well to start of with ambience is really good but would be more lively if they play some soft rock music too.

Vijay Soni,"Rated they offer a very large variety of drinks and cocktails with tasty starters. Interior is awesome with decorated wall and cool work. (Its not completely like warehouse). Classy crowd thanks to price and location of Connaught place. They lacked little in service. but overall experience was as expected. Recommended: Outdoor sitting with Veg Kebab, Chicken Tikka with choice of drink.",Rated 3.5,29,43,??
Adyut H Goel,"Rated Warehouse Inventory, now that is something different for marking your Menu Card. Situated in the ever bustling inner circle of Connaught Place, this is one place which should not be missed by you. As I was there for a corporate office lunch, the small area on the first floor was booked by my boss. The seating provided was cosy and comfortable with privacy for us. the food was pretty good, I am sorry here because I really didn't bother to know the names of the dishes. One was a thin crust pizza like thing which was square in shape, the other was a stuffed Kulcha like thing served with Hummus. amazing experience.",Rated 4.5,65,579,??
Ankit Gupta,Rated Visited this place last month - I found this to be an okayish place...for me the music was too loud..the food was nothing out of the world..tried pasta and crostini..!!One thing which I did like about the place was that the staff was really helpful - suggesting what to order; answering our questions properly and customizing the drinks!!,Rated 3.0,56,238,??
Rishabh Kumar,Rated I simply love the ambience of this place. I had tried White sauce pasta which was delicious and had a couple of drinks. The place is kinda pricey but the ambience make up for it. I would definitely recommend people to visit it.,Rated 4.5,13,77,??

Rishabh Singh,Rated The place has indoor as well as outdoor seating. I went with a couple of my friends and took an outdoor table which gave us a view of the whole inner circle. I would recommend outdoor seating especially in winters. The staff is very amiable and the place is one of those which surprises you with the kind of menu offering they have. 365 dishes arranged in the form of a calendar is not just pleasant to the eyes but to the taste buds as well. Portions are good as per the price you pay for it. Will recommend the place to people who want to spend quality time with friends but obviously the place will not fit in if you are looking for a budget outing. Get ready to shell out something around 1.5k (with alcohol),Rated 4.0,27,204,??
Aastha Mattoo,Rated I have just went once over there and it did not give me a best of the impression .It is an ok place to hang out with your friends.Seating arrangements are not too pleasing and the seats being placed quite far from each other that u'll have to actually shout to make the other person hear.Food is average.The lights are pure red which makes you go nuts coz it's neither dark nor a good light fr visibility .Not value for money.,Rated 3.0,9,50,??

Mitali Raheja,"Rated Warehouse Cafe was on my wishlist from a very long time, and finally the day came when one of my friend ( dj by profession ) told me that he will be playing at the warehouse in the evening. Food - this was the first time when i was so curious to try almost each dish on the menu.. i must say a grand elaborate menu with so many choices what i tried finally was Prawn tempura ( being my favourite ) crisp batter, crunch prawn makes the combination for the dish, but again i asked for mayo coz i didn't like their marinated soy & sweet chilly sauce. but overall was good Donar kebab - little disappointed. portion size was good. but it was completely bland. barely can taste the chicken or the peppers inside. Warehouse chicken tikka - it was again a average chicken tikka, combining spicy chicken tikka with achaari chicken tikka. though the quality of the chicken was much more better compared to most of the places in cp and in gkII. Drinks - just had couple of beers as i was scheduled for a meeting early in the morning, so was not in the mood to make mysely high. Anyhow i will be going back to try out their cocktail menu as well. A Suggestion - please train your staff, the basic level of courtesy is missing in your staff, i mean when i have ordered for the food, still the food came first and after 10 minutes the cutlery came.. also really have to wait for the staff to see us so that we can order something else or can get our beers repeated. please you should look into this or train your staff well. overall a average experience.",Rated 3.0,7,17,??

Ankur Jain,"Rated Visited them about 8 months back (review is for that visit). Liked their concept of Whole Sale, Ware House size, I guess many people would have already talked about this. Ordered beer which would taste same everywhere. Talking about food - Pesto Pasta ordered was served as a regular cheese sauce pasta, which came after a long wait. After tasting, asked server to replace it, he questioned us why are we complaining after having 1 small portion - Damm how can we complain before having a bite? Again the replacement took its long sweet time.",Rated 2.5,63,96,??

Rahul Yadav,"Rated We thought of checking this out after reading through the reviews. The fancy lift is a welcome, but the overall ambience is just ok. Music was loud enough but poor choice of songs. Service : Quick and prompt but lack hospitality. Food: Worse. Order three items and none was of satifiable quality. Pizza was just ok, while another chicken item we ordered was pathetic.",Rated 2.0,52,237,??
ADitya Kandari,"Rated So i was looking for a place to kill time and i went to warehouse cafe..looked decent first...i wanted a comfortable place with sofa and all but the receptionist said the only place available for 5 people was the high chairs and table..i could see few empty seats but they told me they are reserved so we settled down for the high chairs..ambience is ok...but music bad...food bad..i ordered chicken nachos..not that good, they were kinda okay..then we also ordered drums of heaven and it was the worst drums of heaven ever...couldnt even finish a piece..my friend ordered spinach cottage cheese pizza..also not good..definitely not gonna visit again",Rated 2.0,1,30,??

Siddhartha Mundhra,"Rated The place is good.. The menu is put across in quite a nice and unique way.. And raises your expectations.. But somehow the place is not able to live up to it. There is nothing wrong, but nothing that stands out as well.. other than the menu. The service was efficient and the liquor combos are also worthwhile if you are a visiting in a group. Brightening the place slightly more might help.",Rated 3.0,93,138,??
Atul Ranjan,"Rated I had a chance to visit this place sometime back. The visit was a unplanned one as i had to meet a friend so we decided to hangout out in cp.Due to weekend rush we couldnt get a place at other places but we got a place at warehouse afrer waiting for over 15 mins. Frankly the place was not the exciting and was dull. Food was just ok, nothing exceptional about it. Overall its a decent and I am giving extra one point just because i got a place to sit and had a great time with my friend. Cheers to warehouse, we'll surely visit again.",Rated 4.0,22,46,??
Rahul Singh,"Rated Speaking about the Ambiance of this, would like to say that its different and it gives a nice warehouse feel which goes well in sync with its name. The music is soft and the place has a good amount of seating space meant for both couples, small as well as large groups of friends. The one thing on the menu that you should order straight away are the Mozzarella Fingers and trust me after eating one full plate you will feel satisfied from inside. This dish goes well with a pint of beer but for people who are little tight on budget this place has different happy hour rules so better check them out before you go. The service seemed to be slow as it was a Sunday evening when I went so was kind of disappointed with that fact but overall this place is a good one when it comes to chilling and spending time with your friends over hookah and food.",Rated 3.5,87,581,??

Akshay Kumar,Rated I have visited this place quite a lot - just coz it is supposedly trendy and people are supposed to love it. Food might be good. But once the waiters and staff open their mouth - You realise you have just gone to a dhaba at some hostile place on the earth where people are rude and frustrated. Egoistic schmucks is what describes their behaviour. This is the last restaurant/bar I'd go to in Delhi just coz of the staff. If you sit there long enough for a drink they keep bugging you to order more - unbelievable..they treat u like muck!,Rated 1.0,14,221,??
Apeksha Mehra,Rated Actually want to rate it 0 stars but that option isnt there. They make the most pathetic hookah ever. We kept coughing all the time inspite of making innumerable attempts they couldnt fix it. No skilled staff. Their starters are horrible too. We were so disappointed that we didnt order any main course. Highly priced unnecessarily and food and drinks not worth it. Service very very poor. I'll never visit the place again even if they offer me 100% doscount.,Rated 1.0,21,73,??
Varun Verma,Rated Pooor Hukka. The Hukka team is changed now. You can make a better Hukka than the new team out there. Un cooperative staff.

A place for an evening intended to be well spent with friends. Good range of drinks, decent food and flavoured Hookahs - This place offers it all.

Utthara Korada,"Rated The food was good! I went there early, around 12 o'clock on a sunday, which why I believe, there was less waiting. The lighting was dim and adequate, just enough to add to the lovely ambience of a warehouse. Service is extremely quick. The music volume was soothing until 2 pm and then they turned it up to an extent that I couldn't hear my own thoughts!! And then, I just had to leave. Overall, a good ecperience. Will visit again to try out the plethora of dishes.",Rated 3.5,18,12,??

Anmol Parashar,"Rated I visited this place a few months back and was impressed by the privacy they provide even after being in CP. The food is pretty average. This place is only recommended to grab a few drinks with friends. The food is a bit overpriced. We ordered one of their costliest drink at 7:55 because we thought their Happy Hours are till 8 but they brought the drinks at 8:10 and told us we'll have to pay for both of them. We managed to get a bill of Rs. 9500, just the 7 of us. The in house DJ sucks. He just plays a shitty playlist from a lappy and do not take well to requests because he is all so busy whatsapping his girlfriend. The staff was too nosy in our business.

Ritesh Rajput,"Rated I was attracted to this place because of its outdoor sitting.... terrace and that too in the heart of Delhi's most happening place, cp !! But to my great disappointment the place turned out to be a put down and other than the feeling of being on an open terrace in cp there was nothing much remarkable bout it Starting with the staff, they didn't seem quite warm or hospitable and were rather inattentive..... As mentioned I asked for a table on the terrace but it turned out to be a disaster in terms of ambience as the music was too loud and place too dark and shady for an outdoor sitting and rather fitting for some nightclub. And as trivial as it may sound but the seats were quite uncomfortable to hang around. As I often tend to judge a new place by its preparation of the very basic chilly chicken dry,I ordered the same. And it turned out to be very average and compared to the rates not at all upto the mark.. I also orderd a masala peanuts to go with my bucket of 5 beer. But that was also very unsatisfactory. The place is very unreasonably high priced compared to the other really great restro-pubs In that vicinity. Would recommend route 04 castle9, Blues and ardour over this place...",Rated 2.5,21,36,??

Gourav Bindal,"Rated sometimes we confused our self , sometimes we even don't known why are we visit restaurants. for some it is for food, for some it is its interiors and all ,and some want a place to chill , , for me i want all but main ingredient is food , if i cannot enjoy the food then i am not enjoying myself , and if i am not enjoying then what is in interiors and ambience , i can enjoy that in good art gallery, so why should waste my money in those restaurants. for me warehouse cafe is the same , where food is below the average.The only reason people give that much rating is because of its nice and groovy interiors and design. we were seven people on someones birthday and decide this place because of zomato ratings(over). we order many different dishes and try to find does any singe item had taste , but whole lot of dishes disappoint us except shakes, thus why i am giving that much low rating to this place. this place can be enjoyable only, when you visit for drinks and to watch cricket or some other sports as that time you will be not focusing on food.",Rated 2.5,1,31,??

So there was a problem in seating us ... They asked us to take the table at the terrace ... But terrace was too warm to be comfortable with . It was my partners birthday ... A reallyy special occasion for us ... And we were siting at the bar waiting for our seats ... It took them 15 min to place us ... But finallyy we got seated , the ambience is very dingy ... LOUD ... Smokey ... The darkness was a little too much ... The interiors are very warmly woody !! The menu was quite impressive ... It involved great amount of varieties ... So for drinks we both ordered a pina colada ... Which was amazinggg ... The taste was good ... The first sip itself did the talking . For food we ordered a chicken shawarma and mix sauce pasta ... Our fav. Items ... Both of them turned out to be yummyyy ... But i would give the edge to the pasta ... It tasted a lottt better ... Not too creamy not too dry ... Very much appropriate . In all the food was good ... Willing to try more items in my next visit . The place was flooded with people ... The crowd was nice ! In all the place was nice ... Apart from the dinginess ... Can be a little more bright ... Shared a good evening here .... The service was nicee too .. !",Rated 3.5,85,436,??

I cnt even rate this cafe a 1 star.. we have ordered chikenwings.. wid hot sauces..was acceptable but the garlic bread wid cheese was horrible.. the cheese was very sweet and was not fresh.. ao it was a wastage.. wen we complaint, they said this is the way the cheese should be as if we have never seen cheese in our lifetime.. so we have decided to move on and ordered some corn rolls wid mionees. . It wasnt fresh too.. we have decided to have those rolls wid red sause. . Which worked well and we enjoyed the dish somehow.. now we were sitting at the couches and sm1 suddenly switched on some unbearable lights and wen we asked to switch it off .. dey said .. dey cnt do that.. I didnt understand the logic.. What nonsense. . We are not looking for cozy place guys.. it was coming directly in front of my eyes.. and it was unbeaeable unbeaeable. .and at last rhey sent me a bill wid 2 extra things added worth 1000bucks extra.. I asked to remove.. and the guy who was serving us was started to think if we really had it.. I asked him to check the plates on my table if he can find any dish.. ans den he agreed and got me the new bill.. so I wud never recommend this shitty place to anyone ever..I hate it.. if we are paying money then we have a right to get the service... please learn something from hard rock cafe.. that's a class.",Rated 1.0,3,9,??

Well this review is completely for the experience and not the food. So it Please do not expect much for the food content however I surely can suggest this place for the experience that too out door. The Place has inside and outside seating. I decide seating outside with my friends. They have happy hours till 8 in the evening. I had to go through the misunderstanding/miscommunication for the happy hours which completely spoilt my mood however later the server made it up for us. I am glad he did. because of the incident we decide not to dine at the same place. I did not find the menu very exciting anyways but definitely would like to try out the food as well. Hope that happens soon. Till then this is cool place to chill out with friends categorically on the roof top. OH yes I tried there peanut masala which was fine.

Although there was nothing very special about it but still it was still okayish in taste. I really liked their service since the food was served in just a few mins. However the sad ( read: good) part is that they're very strict about the drinking thing. They won't serve you alcoholic drinks if you're not 25 or above. Also, I really loved their bar setting.

Geetika Sharma,"Rated I have been meaning to write a review for this place for long but was putting it off since I could never decide what do I say of it. The experience has been mixed and have never repeated my visit so as to see if the experience differs the next time around. The place is REALLY loud. It is impossible to have a decent conversation. Also, I do not appreciate the ambience quite much. I understand that they wanted to create a warehouse and have brought in all the relevant elements for the same, which makes the place look pretty funky and fun. But it doesn't have to be soooo dark after all. But I like the Bar area, which looks quite elegant. Coming to their menu, it is diverse and rich. Service is very swift and I felt for a second as if they pre-prepare their dishes. :-P How can one possibly be soooo fast with the meals after all. The food was awesome. I loved the pasta with Pubjabi zing. The Phuket Paneer was delicious and highest scorer on the Report Card. It was so soft and overwhelmingly done with the toppings. The shakes were average and not something to boast of. Nice place to hang out with friends over a few drinks.

Piyush Dhawan,"Rated I believe Warehose Cafe has the perhaps the best view of the inner circle but also perhaps one of the worst service in the inner circle as well. It is certainly not the same same service that was offered when it initially opened. I had gone with my friends and were meeting after ages and hence decided to go to Warehouse to catch up, it certainly became a catch-up game with ther service staff. It was like our duty to request and remind the staff that we had ordered something to eat and to drink. I have never come across a place which has 3 different staff people ( one to get only food menu, one to get drink menu and one to get Sheesha menu). They certianly need a basic course in managemement and also i don't really undertsand the possesiveness with Menu cards ( first for a group of 6 people we get only one menu card, i don't know if they want us to pass it on to everyone or if they actually haven't got more printed menu cards, and as soon as you order they quickly take it away as if we are gonna steal them and take it back to our houses) , anyways the food was at par ( certainly not the standard of a three point something restaurant). Someof my friends who had been to the place earlier cautioned me to notice the bill in detail as they had discrepancy in their bill, perhaps it was not a good day for warehouse with us ( we also had extra drinks put on our bill and it took more time for them to change the bill than getting the food). I sincerely hope this place gets its act together as certainly as it is not even 50% of what it used to be. I also believe that they should stop flaunting the music system, someone should tell them that playing loud songs on highest volume is not cool anymore, people genuinely want to talk and not want to shout at each other. What a waste of money!!",Rated 2.0,1,40,??

LBB Delhi & Gurgaon,"Rated A massive seating area, plush leather sofas, a noir film reminiscent long bar, baroque chandeliers, and a terrace overlooking one of Delhis most iconic zip codes - Warehouse Caf looks like a warehouse, after an extreme home makeover. The only detailing testament to its name are perhaps the bare-bricked walls, high ceilings, open ducts and industrial-inspired lighting {bordering on ambient}. An interesting mix of rustic and regal, Warehouse offers the standard fare of cocktails, shots, a multi-cuisine menu, live match screenings, loud music, and major human traffic. The food menu has on it 365 options, one for every day of the year! Our 2 Cents | Warehouse comes alive during peak sports seasons, and should be at the top of your list for some major sport{ing} spirit and barely containable enthusiasm. For the minimal conversationalist, the decibel level of the music indoors will provide a safe haven of sorts. For the conversations-over-cocktails supporters, the expansive terrace should be your choice of seating {PS - it overlooks the newly installed Indian Flag, Central Park, and CPs crescent inner circle; all in all, an almost unbeatable view}. Winning Drinks | Definitely try the LIT, Mai Tai and the unusual Bell Pepper Margarita. If youre part of a bigger party, the pitchers are great value for money; we recommend the Watermelon Supernova, Psycho Jack, and the Faithful B****. Do Note |The food menu is designed like a calendar, where every item on the menu corresponds to a date. To give you a little incentive, if your order the dish listed on the 11th of April, on the 11th of April, you get a 50% discount on that particular dish! littleblackbookdelhi.com",Rated 4.0,15,102,??

It is one of the best places to grab a drink in the town and the ambience has an upbeat feeling to it. Almost alway crowded is how you can describe it as well may be. It is dark and has a warehouse type feeling to it. We ordered the hukka, a corona bucket, nachos with chicken and chilly chicken. The nachos were great with plenty of chicken snd cheese. I initial ordered a hoegaarden pitcher but unfortunately as I mentioned in my earlier reviews, it isn't available at most of the places. The ushers were helpful and helped with the selection and the place has great DJ honestly. I saw people enjoying at the bar as well and I think the crowd didn't look rowdy at all there either.

Menu was like a calender as you can see in the menu section above but that doesn't mean you will get discount on the dishes mentioned on a particular day if you arrive same day atleast not in my case.

The flavors were great and fish was cooked to perfection.. The donor kabab were just OK.. The nasi goreng was below average.. Have eaten much better nasi goreng in at least five restraunts in Delhi..

Vikrant Arora,"Rated Was meeting a friend and his wife after ages. They preferred a place in C.P and this place came to my mind as I had heard good things about this place although had never been to this place. It's recommended on zomato to book a table so I called up this place in the afternoon and a lady named Sangeeta refused to take my request for booking a table for 4. She said we don't take bookings for 4 on weekends, we only take bookings for large groups so you can walk in and look for a place. I found this a bit absurd but then this is Delhi and you just can't do anything about it. It was Saturday and we reached at around 9pm. The place was almost full but the manager gave us a table for 4. It's spread across two floors and then they also have a terrace. It was hot and humid so we preferred to stay in but we checked out the terrace and the view from the terrace was amazing. Al fresco can definitely be considered in winters or when the weather is pleasant. The server who was at our table was extremely arrogant and rude. I don't know that was wrong with him and I just didn't care to ask his name. I didn't even feel like giving my orders to him and time and again tried to catch hold of another server to place my order. This guy made my otherwise pleasant experience unpleasant. They have enormous options for hookah. We went with our fav one i.e Pan flavor and it was good. In mocktails we tried Adams apple and it was OK. Mojito was fine too. The shot glass in Jaggerbomb was upside down.. Don't think that's the right way to serve the drink but that can be ignored. In food, we ordered Half n Half pizza wherein you have a choice of choosing any two pizza from their menu and as the name suggests, the pizza served to you is a combination of both of these. Chicken tikka was good too. Mozzarella sticks were just fine. Hara Bhara Kabab was also fine. The music was pretty loud and we were finding it difficult to talk but basis the concept , it should have been only comfortably loud. We should have been more careful in choosing the right place when we were catching up after a long time. Overall it was fine. there are much better places in Delhi to explore before I consider going back here.",Rated 2.5,44,197,??

Me and my friends pre booked a table through bite quest and when reached we were told you will have to wait... they said we didn't confirm the booking when I actually got the message that it was booked... Still we decided to wait and were hoping the food would make up for it... After waiting for half an hour in the gloomy dark place where you practically have to use your cell phone's light to actually read the menu (yes it's that dark) we finally got a table. We asked them for water and i guess the waiter practically forgot about it...we had to remind him after an hour that dude we asked for water an hour back.We ordered pizza Indiana ,pad thai noodles and two drinks and boy was the food bad. The pizza tasted stale and bland, the noodles were badly done like I have tried pad thai noodles in other places and they taste so much better else where. The drink as recommended by the waiter would be a good punch actually tasted like spicy water and nothing else. It didn't end there they didn't give us the discount that they were supposed to provide as we had a reservation through bite quest. The manger kept on arguing with us and then card was not accepted and we had to pay in cash. The food was highly overpriced according to the taste. The service was poor,music was loud adding to our disappointment about the place. All in all a total DISASTER... would never go back there.",Rated 1.0,2,48,??
Nikhil Awasthi,Rated The place is quite loud but a good place to watch matches and have a quality time with your friends. You might have to wait to get a table at their peak timings and weekends.

No one told us about it when we entered the restaurant, which is located on the first floor and one has to take a lift for reaching it. The lift, though, is not available for climbing down.

One can easily spot a humble guy near the lift that takes you to the 1st floor of the cafe. Even on a dry day they were serving alcohol kudos to that ! The cafe was almost full but we found a nice place for 3. Coming straight to the highlights ! Ambience : As the name says ""warehouse"" the lighting justified that, it was low but comfortable enough to walk without bumping into another's table and the walls were all rough to give a raw look. The place was filled with the sweet frag of hooka. Music was good too, just some good beats and bass. Food&drinks: Had a non veg platter and bhatti paneer. Both were great. Didnt try much. Beer was served chilled and got 1 plus 1 too coz of the Happy hours. Verdict: overall a nice place to chill with frnds. Staff was grt and swift.

Ayushi Aggarwal,"Rated I have wanted to visit this place for quite some time - mainly for the uniquely designed, albeit wide-ranging menu card, amazing food and large number of recommendations by friends. The food turned out to be great. Sadly, the same cannot be said about the soft drinks we tried. The milkshake was bland and did not have a good consistency. It was just too thin for my taste. We had a Pizza, Veg. Platter and the non-veg. lasagna. The Lasagna was delicious - with crushed chicken pieces and beautifully prepared layers of pasta and cheese. I couldn't have enough of it and would've ordered another one, if there time. The Warehouse Special Pizza(thin-crust) was generously covered with cheese and toppings. The Veg. Platter, however, was clearly the best dish. The place is adequately staffed- a tad overstaffed, I think. This place is quite appropriately named - it's dark with dark lighting. Needless to say, we couldn't appreciate anything but the bathroom floors. The floor is bronze and the fittings complement the whole decor. I'd like to go to Warehouse Cafe again mainly to try out more dishes on their huge menu and another helping of the tasty pasta.",Rated 4.5,36,137,??

Sushant Arora,"Rated One of the most popular cafes of C.P., the Warehouse Caf is actually one of the best places to hangout and have good food and drinks. Though we just stuck to non-alcoholic ones still the experience was nice. Among multiple available options with their interesting menu, we ordered chocolate and hazelnut shake, vanilla n caramel smoothie and fancy wasabi mocktail along with Warehouse special veg pizza. The fancy wasabi mocktail had a strong taste to it and was the best thing we tried that day. The vanilla n caramel smoothie was also nice and thick feel to it. The chocolate and hazelnut shake was just ordinary shake and was nothing unique. The pizza was square shaped with thin crust and had nice multiple toppings and tasted yummy with sauces and condiments provided. Talking about the ambience, the dim light setting with club music gave nice high feel to the place. The service was also very nice and quick and each attendant was very friendly and attentive. With all these positive points, the caf is one of the places in Delhi which should not be missed if you love to hang out with friends.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Do not even think of visiting this place on a weekend without a booking. The crowd is posh and elegant. The bar is striking.Coming to the food, I liked the calender layout menu. Though took me a few seconds to figure out. We ordered 5-6 random dishes from all kinds of cuisines and everything was delicious. Literally everything.

Abhimanyu Singh,"Rated Warehouse Cafe is another beer joint in CP. I don't mean that pejoratively but there is really nothing separating it from the many other similar joints in the area. This review like all reviews is subjective and personal and therefore may not resonate with everyone. The beer was comfortably priced, although Beer Cafe has more variety. My friends also got a hookah which they liked. But I really don't appreciate places as loud as Warehouse Cafe. If I am enjoying a night out with my buddies, I like to talk and laugh along with enjoying a cold beer. So the downstairs is loud, noisy, dark and smelling of smoke and upstairs on the patio (even with the misters on) it is too hot and sticky. Maybe I have been spoilt rotten by English style pubs where people are more interested in their beers and conversations with each other rather than the loud music affecting my hearing. At any rate go there for cheap pitchers, stay away if you want to not inhale kilos of smoke and suffer torn eardrums.",Rated 3.0,12,38,??

It has all wooden floor, wooden everything, bucket seats, throw pillows and the most vivid part were the dim lights. Hookah, Alcohol, projector TV and ambience, what more do you want? Ok what would you say if it has this open balcony with a magnificent view of DELHI. Yes it has that too and its fabulous but you need to be a little early if you want a seat there. Food: Margherita pizza and Beer thats what I ordered here. The Pizza is good and beer served chilled. Margherita was OK, thin crust and sauce good so it went well with the beer. Hookah: It was good but a little pricey. I expected this keeping in mind the name and fame of this place. Beautifully prepared and yes not choking at all. Service: It was O.K. We were asked to sit inside but later upon requesting they gave us a seat at there balcony but thanks to 'Delhi Ki Zardi' had to move back in. HAHA but worth a try.

They have a Dinner menu available throughout the day, which is something I absolutely loved. Plus, their eggs Benedict are amazing! The service was top notch, always quick and attentive. The price is a little higher than what you will pay in the city, but well worth it.

As soon as we entered warehouse, the first thing I noticed is the space..there wasnt any space constraint and the menu..the impeccable menu..with 365 dishes with a dish for every day..its like the vegetarian curse got removed..The menu offered a lot more variety and choices for vegetarian people..And u get 50% discount on the dish written under the date of visit category.. Though I didnt like the staff constantly nagging us to place orders..they didnt wait even when we told them that we plan to order after finishing our drinks..the ambience is dimly lit with wooden furniture background giving you the feel of kinda grunge pubs of America..yet its classy with its crowd and music.. The food is simply amazing..One should try their achari paneer tikka, peppercorn cheese roll and spinach roasted garlic pizza..I cant comment on non vegetarian food..and drinks are ok too..But the place is a bit expensive and only if you go in a group then it doesnt leave you with a dent in your pocket.",Rated 3.5,65,549,??

Rohit.rocky,Rated Nothing special about the place. This place is just outside gate number 3 of Rajiv chowk station. Well I had read all the positive reviews from people on zomato.Now I thought if people rated the place so highly why was it not worth my expectations . Was I expecting more than others or something different. What is a objective review. Every one expects differently. Let me try as much possible a objective review as possible. 1. Place - There is nothing better than CP 2. Ambience - found nothing great about it.Chaotic. 3. Food - This is make or break of any restaurant.Nothing exemplary. 4. Chairs - uncomfortable. At bar front the chair's were so uncomfortable.Otherwise the tables at dine space were unstable. 5. Staff- pathetic.I asked someone in English about what is good about meat menu.The guy in rustic dhaba tone replied - chicken tikka and seekh kabab.I would have died of foul smell had I not pushed back in time. 6. VFM- They charge exorbitantly considering the experience they offer.I hate to be taken for a ride and it is not that I expect the experience to come cheap but this was no experience. Overall I felt class matters and this place clearly lacked it.Must be some rich uneducated guy running this place who cannot appreciate what connoisseurs of taste and experience wish for.,Rated 2.5,1,5,??

The food here is like any other regular restaurant, barring the fact that it is a little overpriced. Menu is really vast, they have around 365 dishes for every day of the year. Music is quite good and loud, too much of noise and dark.The terrace also had a calming effect on me as the place as wonderful view of CP with Giant Indian Flag hovering over the park.

If you are in the mood for a few cocktails and maybe a 'hookah' then head to this cafe located in the inner circle. The service is prompt even at peak hours. Stepping out from the lift, your eyes will take a few minutes to adjust to the surroundings. The dim lighting adds an eerie touch to the place.

If you don't mind eating food you cant really see, you might like this place. couples might see this as a cosy place and somehow on a certain visit i spotted a table with aunties from a kitty party group, yes its delhi yahan Sab kuch chalta hain. improvements on the service, lighting could do wonders for this place! keep Gobbling. xx gobblediaries.wordpress.com",Rated 3.0,125,805,??

Nahadoth,"Rated I didn't try the food. I'm unhappy with this place, and would avoid it, for two reasons: 1) The two times that I've been there, they didn't have the beers specified to be on tap. The waiters do not know their drinks and will attempt to give you an ale as an alternative to the wheat beer you wanted (instead of another wheat beer). The music is deafening. Tables are marked 'reserved' although they're not. 2) The music is deafening. This is a good place if you want to go drink, and do nothing else. But if you want to talk to the friends you're with (or protect your eardrums) avoid it. I could forgive them if there was decent music but it's all generic house-type rubbish.",Rated 1.5,3,0,??

Anirudh Singhal,"Rated Why I was there? Was out with my fiancee and we just had decided that its too hot and we want to sit in a lounge while circling the inner circle. After 5 steps we saw warehouse cafe and we decided to step in. Ambience The lift on the ground floor is a pleasant surprise and raises your expectations from the beginning. We were greeted by a pleasant hostess and shown to a comfortable seat. Being the football world cup season everybody was dressed in jerseys and the big screens on all the walls were playing highlights. I am fan so I liked it a lot. The music was loud so it was difficult to be polite while talking. Not a good place for business meetings. The seats and table height are comfortable and have not been compromised for style statements. The washrooms are well maintained. 4.5 on 5 in ambience Drinks They have something against wines and don't have anything except some passable medium bodied collection. The beer array is also limited though they are well stocked on hard liquors. My 'To Be' tried two mocktails and they were passable. 3 on 5 in drinks. Food We ordered Pasta and Salads. Standard stuff which you expect. Nothing spectacular or out of the box. If you are in the mood to try something new in food try someplace else. Value for Money its not that cheap but not overtly expensive. The Sheesha prices are way off the charts though and not worth it. Verdict All in all a good place for going out for an hour or two if you are into group sports watching and have money to shell out, please go ahead. Nothing spectacular but all in all comfortable. No bad or good surprises.",Rated 3.5,9,48,??

Otherwise, the ambiance, music, style of the cafe is totally upto the mark ! & Two big screens just add on to their ambiance! During my last visit with my girlfriends, we ordered an ""achari paneer tikka"" & ""hara bara kebab"" for appetizers ! Achari paneer tikka was a simple tikka platter *did not like much*, kebabs were comparatively better ! Their pizza pepperoni was floating with cheese and was totally mouth watering ! *yummy* Phad Thai Noodles were okay in taste but the quantity wasnt sufficient as compared to their other dishes !

This place does justice to the ratings given by other customers. Ambiance: 4.5/5 . As the name suggests, it does look like a warehouse with wooden/ bamboo walls, orange dim lights etc. Food Quality: 4/5 . It was good. From what we had ordered, mozarella fingers was best. Food quantity: 3/5. It was very less, it would be good if they increase the quantity to at least sufficient for 2. Drinks: 4.5/5. Reasonable as compared to other bars. If only they could extend happy hours to imported beers too. :-/ Hospitality: 4/5. They should keep more bartenders than servers. People would like to see their drinks/ shots being made on the table. We ordered Jagerbombs, but we got it served on the table already prepared. :-( Total: 4/5. Overall: Good experience.",Rated 4.0,3,84,??

SincerelyKangna,"Rated Warehouse cafe has been trending a lot lately and for all healthy reasons. Located in CP's inner circle, this place is very easy to locate. Be it catching with long lost friend or planning a date, this place can serve as one of the best option available in the city. Here are few pointers about the place: - Just like its name the whole look and feel of the place resembles an urban warehouse. - CAUTION: This place is hell trendy. - Mostly visited by elite class of people, this place has a nice and very modern feel to it. - Hospitality this place offers is very warm and will surely make you plan a revisit. - Food n Drinks menu you get here is very elaborate and dishes are well described. - Food you get is nicely cooked and served fresh. - One must look out of- various options available in pizza, pasta. I really like starters here. I personally have never tried main course food here. - Not a fan, but I noticed people having hookah here. So all you hookah lovers, watch out. - Entire place is very spacious and seating is well spread over two floors. This place also has really nice outdoor seating. Pray for a nice Delhi evening and then land up in warehouse cafe. The view you get from its terrace is just amazing. - Staff is nice and polite to talk to. One thing I noticed each time i visited this place is - They just don't let people under 25 of age to drink and they are very ""particular"" about it. They may even ask you for an identity proof. So all you under age drinkers, BE AWARE !! Each time I plan a visit to CP with my friends, the first place that clicks in my head is this place. I have thoroughly enjoyed this place each time I have visited it. Hope you enjoy your visit too. My Rating: Food:4/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Value for Money: 4/5 Overall: 4/5 Visiting Again?

On the downside (little bit): they were understaffed and underprepared for the Saturday night rush, so orders took a little long despite the staff running around most of the time.

Dwaipayan Mitra,Rated Sad place. Somebody please tell the owner that running a food joint is more about quality of the food and service. The only good thing about them.... They served me cold beer... and that's not too hard I believe. Sunday I went there and asked for beef stake medium rare and after 30 min they came back with well done. That's sucks man.... that too it's buff not beef. Asked for salt and pepper and they took 5 minutes to give me that. Also salt was given to me in a bowl.

Shantanu Srivastava,"Rated Finally got a chance to remove this off my list. We were 6 people in total and because of a Happy Hours going on, we ended up drinking more than eating. The LIIT was superb to start with. Thus is the strongest I've had and the quantity was good as well. Among the non-veg items we ordered, Chicken Saute and Chicken Malai Tikka were splendid. The sauce used to grill the chicken saute gave it that 'tingy' taste which I liked a lot. The 'malai' of the tikka was also nice and the chicken itself was soft. Chicken BBQ strips were also nice and crisp. The lone veg item we ordered was Hummus Pita and I didn't like it much. It was sort of bland but I've been told it is usually much better elsewhere. The ambience is nothing special. Different types of seating arrangements from couches to sofas to High Rise tables are there. A special mention to the menu. It was very well organized, with so many options in food items, in a calendar like format and it didn't become difficult for me to go through it anytime. It's a little high on the prices but there were soo many interesting items in the menu like Lamb Cheese Burger, Tenderloin Steak etc. that I've to visit 3-4 times more to take it all in. ;) Edit- 1 more visit. Sexy Beef Burger, Amazing Chicken Pesto Pasta and the Mushroom Sauce in Stuffed Grilled Chicken was fantastic. Rating at 4 now. :)",Rated 4.0,50,148,??
Vatsala Mittal,"Rated This place has always topped the charts when it comes to lounge bars in Central Delhi. So finally we decided to go up through the small elevator! What welcomed us upstairs were smiling attendants and a great ambience! Darkly lit interiors, the aroma of sheesha in the air and several big screens made it a perfect backdrop! Now since we weren't in a mood for alcohol (yes, imagine!) il straight away jump to describing the food. We ordered veg quesadillas, malai soya seekh followed by penne alfredo and a veg lasagna (thats too much of cheese, i know!) Now the quesadillas were melt-in-the-mouth ones! Great preparation! Malai soya seekh- dry dry dry! Please avoid! Alfredo was creamy and yum! Veg lasgna had nothing really worth mentioning. Undercooked pasta sheets, wierdly dry filling and oodles of cheese. Unfortunately the menu lacked enough non alcoholic drinks. Just some basic coffee, tea and fresh lime. Whats worth mentioning is the prompt service and willing attendants. Food arrived jus in time and there was always a waiter standing at a distance, ready to clear the table and offer assistance. Overall a great ambience, nice variety in food and comfortable seating.

We went there on a weekday and the place was almost packed. They serve hookah, & have big screens for screening matches. Now, for the food. They have an innovative menu design for food, in the form of a calender,where you get 50% off on the dish written for that day. So irrespective of when you go, you will get the discount on one dish! They have excellent variety of veg and non-veg dishes. We had three dishes; pasta arabita, nachos and the lasagna. All 3 of them were delicious! Though the prices for the food and drinks were on the higher side, they were worth it. They also have good offers if you want to buy multiple drinks (eg. reduced prices for 5 or 10 pints of beer).

The cafe has a normal small entrance by elevator, but the fun begins when the door opens. The perfect ambience, superb environment, jam-pack seats, full of people and loud rocking music. I rarely found a place full of crowd, and warehouse is one of them, always popular among party peoples. After reading many reviews, i feel lucky, as i got the place to seat immediately after the entering the place. It was perfect time to celebrate, lot;s of noise due to BIG IPL screens. We ordered drinks, jagor shots & mocktails, all of them perfect. In main course food we had Afgani Kabab, Cheese finger chips, French Salad. All of them put the taste buds.. waterly.. perfect !!

VERY over-hyped place with LOTS of disappointing factors. Its food to start with was very bad. Firstly, my starters were served cold and their taste was equally bad. My pizza was agin very biscuity and its base was super-chewy. Also, the staff was not very friendly and hospitable. Now, the plus points...the ambience and the terrace were relatively good. Also, they have a good menu. Slightly overpriced but yeah, good.

This place is always full on the weekends and holidays (i don't understand the reason for this)... Food - The Menu is very extensive...providing a lot of cuisines to try but the food is not that great...!! Pasta and Drums of Heaven is good..!! (Prices are on the higher side) Ambiance - The ambiance is great, huge place with nice furniture...!!! Music - It might be depressing/dull sometimes..as it wont make you high even after having 3-4 tequila shots.. ;) Service - The staff is not at all courteous. Service is pathetic as they took around 15 minutes for the menu, 30 minutes to take the first order, another 40 minutes to bring the drinks and the starters. By the time i was done with this i had lost my patience to wait more and had to leave.....i was only done with my starters and first round of drink (in 1 Hour 25 mins). I have been to this place thrice and it has been the same story always... :( Hookah - This is one thing which i like about Warehouse cafe....its amazing..!!!

Ami,"Rated I dont get why this place is SO popular that its packed even on Saturday afternoons (okay, Ill grant you the Saturday part but only that much). Sure, it doesnt exactly suck. The menu is extensive which caters to different tastes, they have happy hours till 7:30 PM so thats a yay, and their sheesha is pretty good. But considering that: - The food is just about average (their pastas have always lived up to expectations, the starters never so much); - The place is too dim & smoky for regular plans, yet not dim & smoky enough to make it a really crazy joint, yknow; - The music could be humongously better (its never given me a music high, yet); - The prices arent the cheapest around it remains a mystery to me why its always packed! Perhaps its the word-of-mouth effect: since you hear so much about Warehouse Caf, someone or the other among your friends whos never been there would want to try it when youre making a plan. Maybe its the central location (as opposed to most other places that are more south). Well, whatever it is, good on them for having cracked the code I just hope Ill enjoy the place more IF and when I visit next!",Rated 3.0,17,178,??

But anyway, we ended up ordering a Cold coffee with ice cream, sprite, Veg Kebab platter (which wasn't listed in the menu) and a Veg warehouse burger. The food was really nice and the cold coffee was little sweet for my taste- but nice. Our bill turned out to be Rs 1900 out of which 500 went for tax, which was little OFF for us but then we have got used to paying this much tax at almost every restaurant in Delhi-NCR. :/ Overall a nice place to hang out with friends and I will surely visit it again!",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Ankit Sharma,Rated Located very conveniently in the inner circle of CP this place is a good addition to the list of restaurants around that place.Had heard some nice things about the place and I wasn't disappointed on my visit.CP definitely needed a place which could serve hookah with alcohol and this is it.It serves lip smacking food though at a slightly premium price.The service here needs to get better and music tones down a bit.,Rated 3.5,52,201,??

DesiFoodie,"Rated PROS; Hands down one of the BEST ambience in any restaurant of Delhi. The feel is exactly that of a grotto or something, something unique and very cool. No doubt, you will enjoy the feel of sitting here for your meal. The servers are fast and attentive. Presentation is pretty good. CONS: So why just 3? Because the food is mediocre, and that cannot be forgiven. The place has a MASSIVE menu with hundreds of items arranged in a calendar format, but when we picked out a couple of burgers and a couple of shakes, the shakes were pretty horrible and the burgers just OK. The bill (without drinks) came to around 1000 bucks per head, I feel that with the food quality the place is not value for money. Advice for cafe owners: Consider reducing the number of menu items and focussing on your ""best items"". Better to have maybe 30 good items than 200 mediocre ones. Will visit again, maybe try something else.",Rated 3.0,67,100,??

To our surprise the place was jam packed, which was shocking for a sunday evening. We had a pre booking but we dint find a palce to settle for atleast 20 mintues. The food was not that delicious but was a turnoff for the they charge, We ordered a Veg Platter, a Chicken Skewer BBQ Sauce and a Mozarella Fingers. The Mozarella fingers were pathetic. Veg plattter was not the one which i was expecting. Chicken Skewer was good. The ambience is preety good. They have really worked wonders on ambience. The staff were warm and neatly dressed. Drinks were pretty expensive. Its a hole on pockets. And i can explain the price they charge for Hookah. It was f***ing 950 bucks. Who the hell serve Seesha for 950 bucks.

Shruti Paras,"Rated I love coming here ! It is one of the best cafe's in CP to hang out with your friends. It is a large space mostly filled up with couches. The decor is amazing (dim-lit) with exposed bricks and pipes which gives you a complete feeling of a fancy factory warehouse. There are dark crannies for lovers, a huge terrace, a huge bar, sheeshas and great food. Also, they play great music (electronica). Their food menu is particularly interesting and famously endorsed ""365 dishes for 365 days"" which gives discounts on various food items daily. The dishes in the menu are arranged as a calendar ranging from soups, burgers, pizzas, sea food, barbeque dishes, salads etc. I would strongly recommend American cuisine, barbeque chicken dishes, grilled fish, beer and spirits. They have a swift service. They are eager to please their customers. This place might be a little heavy on pocket. The music is the main feature of Warehouse Cafe plus the terrace, over looking the central park, is an excellent sitting place during evenings.

Anshuman Gandhi,"Rated Only reason I went to Warehouse Caf was because of it coming as highly recommended on Zomato and I happen to have a few fans for this Caf among my friends. First thing I noticed about the place was that is huge. The amount of space is incredible and it is almost always crowded. We went there for a few drinks and a hukka, however it was quite hard to get the waiters attention. I would blame it on the loud music and the rather too dim lights. The beers were not cheap and neither were any of the cocktails or hukkas. Food was ok and nothing to boast about. Not coming back to this place again. Still dont understand why it comes so highly recommended by Zomato or was highly recommended by it and so many people. There are so many better options in CP apart from this which are quieter, conversation and pocket friendly.",Rated 2.5,10,63,??
I Heart Food,"Rated The famous warehouse cafe has everything many people would like but for my taste and my friends taste it was a bit if a downer. We could not wait to run out of there. The restaurant is fixed between a mixed identity. It's all sit down seating. Mind you, when a restaurant has sitdown arrangement, it's promoting cuisine and conversation. Otherwise, blast the music, hold the drink, stand up and we are in a club. The problem here is, the music was so loud that you could not even hear the person next to you shouting. On top of it was so dark that a game of dark room could be played. Jokes apart, it was a punishment, because we were sitting, could not see each other, could not talk, could not get the servers attention and just sat there like ducks. On top of it, the bill was wrong, which is excusable, it's a common mistake and customers should give the benefit of doubt. The food was just ok. Nothing great. Yet again in all my reviews I always say you can't really have a judgement on drinks until it's a cocktail or mocktail which we did not have. I don't think I will return to the restaurant but I definitely recommend people to check it out. It's not a bad place, it just really weird.",Rated 3.0,69,294,??

The music was bit too loud for 9 pm on a weekday but I cant blame them for it. Ordered Khao Suey, Nachos, Pita Breads and loads of different kinds of roasted chicken. All are recommended. After a while though we could not stand the music so took the flight of steps leading to the terrace. Weather was pleasant but there were also mist sprays. We continued our beers here and thoroughly enjoyed them as finally we could talk!

Was in CP once and had an urge to eat something good at a new place when one of my friend recommended Warehouse and then we moved in there. The ambiance is superb (not if you want someplace quiet and less crowded) and the menu is exhaustive. It took me decades to decide what should I eat. It was two of us and we ordered Nachos, Pizza verdure and Veg Quesadillas. food was yummy and filling. Service was decent. Got a table booked through dine out and got a 15% discount (that took care of the tax at least). Overall, nice place with awesome food.",Rated 4.0,51,88,??
Moulshree,"Rated I have visited the Warehouse Cafe several times. However, although many people like it for the very reason that the music is loud and the ambience dark, I would appreciate if they had some more lighting for the tables and a lower volume! But I guess it's fine if everybody likes it! The view from the terrace is great, specially if you go in the winters. In the summers, the sun can be hard to tolerate! Nonetheless, I have always been satisfied with the food there. Whenever I visit, I order the honey chilli potatoes! They are just perfectly cooked, crispy and scrumptious! The tomato basil pesto panini is also quite tasty However, I didn't quite like the penne because it was a tad over cooked for my taste.The fajitas are lovely though! The dish name bhains ki ankh in the deserts menu appeared queer to me. On asking, I found it was just a piece of brownie cut like an eye with an eyeball shaped ice cream placed on top!

The music played was bit loud but who cares duh! The Crowd was overwhelming , Young and Vibrant. We wanted to take a seat on Open Terrace but it was so overcrowded that we decided to settle for the first Floor. It was also crowded considering it was a weekday. I would recommend to make a prior reservation if you are interested in any particular table. Coming to the Food. We ordered Chicken Tikka butit was undercooked. It felt like they have heated earlier cooked Dish in microwave and served it to us. We informed the Staff member and they immediately arranged for replacement. The second round was finger licking good! :) We ordered some mocktails. They were pretty refreshing too. And we also ordered Chicken lasagna it was delightful!

Radhika Roy,"Rated So, this place. It's like entering some, well, warehouse, with dim red lights and huge pipes on the ceiling and chains hanging from the walls. Reminds you of the creepy backroom in movies which is situated in clubs with gangsters playing cards. Moving on, the crowd is quite intriguing. It's divided into family people and youngsters looking to get high. So, basically, a mixture of Moti Mahal and My Bar. Plus, the huge TV and the couches in front of it reminds you of a sports bar. All in all, I think Warehouse tried to create a place which enculcated the qualities of every different eating joint, and I'm not really sure if they succeeded. We got a seat at a table for four which was situated next to these semi circle couches with tables in front of them and people smoking hookah. I was pretty uncomfortable with the seating, but didn't ask to be moved. The menu given to us was very innovative, it was in the form of a calender and that got us a bit excited. Since, we were just looking for snacks, we ordered Chicken Tikka and Chicken Barbeque Strips. We asked for Coke, but it was unavailable, so we got 7-Up instead. One complaint that we had was when you give your costumers a pet bottle of soft drinks and two glasses, it's implied that you should open it and serve it as well. The Chicken Tikka arrived pretty fast and to our surprise, since we were disillusioned by this place already, it was really tasty ! Spicy and juicy. I could have had another plate of that thing, if not for the insane price. Almost 500, by the way. More than places like the Dhaba or really good North Indian restaurants like Have More and Gulati. The Barbeque strips arrived a little later with mayonnaise , and it looked and tasted exactly like those fish fries which you can get at Bijoli Grill. It was yummy nonetheless. No complaints there. For dessert we asked for Black Forest pastry, but it wasn't available, so we ordered Chocolate Mousse instead. Served in a plastic cup, it seemed highly plain, it was a little bitter but okay. All in all, this place is kind of an expensive version of Castle9, with better food of course. The waiters are not that attentive and the cost of just those 2 appetizers and that dessert amounted to 2K. Not really worth a second visit, but pretty interesting for a first one. The 3 is JUST for the Chicken Tikka. EDIT : So, I did end up going for the second time around. The service remains the same. Ordered a Chilly Chicken this time. It was alright. The ambiance, the servers, none of them are up to the mark. The food is their only saving grace.",Rated 3.0,49,459,??

WithoutPrejudice (Arjo),"Rated With most of Connaught Place having lost its charm to tacky bars, Warehouse cafe really does stand out as a serious contender to pull you away from your regular haunt elsewhere in Delhi or a drink and a bite (but mostly a drink). Located in the inner circle, it's easy to miss it if you're just driving by, but if you know what you're looking for or walk by, you'll definitely see it, and want to go in (up). A lot of effort seems to have gone into the decor here, and unlike most places that boast of being large upmarket bars and are really just holes in the wall cashing in on the latest where-to-be-spotted-this-month trend, Warehouse cafe really does offer very comfortable arrangements and an upmarket decor and layout. My favourite however is the view from the terrace, which directly overlooks central park, and on a crisp spring or early winter evening, there really is nothing like it. The menu is a very interesting calendar based format, with twelve pages (months) and as many things on each page as there are number of days in that month! So there is definitely a LOT to go through and variety will not be a problem. We tried the crispy ginger chicken, sausage chicken pizza, and pad thai noodles (see what I mean?). All of the food was very well done, so kudos to the chef for that, but don't expect the sort of quality you would from a specialty restaurant. We paired our food with beer and wine, and although the drinks menu is also fairly well spread out, the wine list is seriously short. In fact there were only two to choose from on this particular day (domestic or not), and the domestic wine was 400++, so fairly steep for a glass of Indian wine. All in all, for a meal for two with drinks, expect to pay in the vicinity of Rs. 3000 for a good time and a heck of a view.",Rated 4.0,73,262,??

We had ordered only one sliced pepper chicken recommended by the waiter himself and the rest was all scotch. The view is really good from their roof though the seats were uncomfortable. The seats in a place where music is going on should be close to each other otherwise one needs to shout. Full marks on ambiance, service and music.

Siddharth Jain,"Rated Wanted to come here since a very long time, just couldn't get around coming here. My cousins were in Delhi from Ahmedabad, and they wanted to go out to a cool place to drink. Thought of taking them out to Warehouse cafe for drinks and snacks. First up, we were lucky to find seating upstairs in the open, overlooking the amazing new Indian flag, Central Park and the crescent inner circle buildings. The weather was amazing and added to the experience. That day there was the India v West Indies match and they had put up a giant screen... Cherry on top! Drinks! Their happy hours is quite decent, 1+1 on domestic/ IMFL and 2+1 on foreign liquor. The happy hours run only till 8PM though. The rates are very reasonable for the ambience and everything. We ordered a few beers, whiskey, vodka and 3 LITs. The standard drinks were great, but the LIT was one of the best I have ever had(I am a fan of the route04 LIT). Food! Their menu is mind boggling expansive! They have so many items to choose from that it gets difficult to make a decision. We ordered a chicken chaat and 3 sliced chicken ginger garlic (the chicken dish of the day). The chaat was so-so to me but my cousins didn't really like it because they found it to be too salty. The sliced chicken ginger was fantastic! The right crunchy juicy chicken with amazing sauce, kimchi and spring onions. Worth trying! Ambiance! Is just amazing. Nice plush furniture, polite waiters, quick service, Indian flag, CP, pretty faces ;) and lots of laughs. Will definitely visit this place. Worth going to again and again! Pro tip: call dine out and make your reservation through them and get 15% discount on food! 011-41414174",Rated 4.5,16,92,??

Avnika Sambher,Rated The interiors of Warehouse Cafe are nicely done and one smells the sheesha in the air as u enter the place ...it is easy to find a cozy corner to settle into and their menu has loads of variety However it is disappointing as they menu which they claim to offer so extensively has loopholes as many of the things specified on the menu are not available ... I really wanted to try the chocolate spring rolls or some hot beverages ..however neither of them were available ... Finally we settled on ordering a pizza half and half plus mozzarella sticks .. The Dip accompanying the appetizer was good and the appetizer too tasted nice...

Sunny Kanwar,"Rated A small and compact elevator takes you up to the Warehouse caf, a restobar in the inner circle of Connaught place. The first thing you notice is the amazing house music that is primarily played on weekends only I assume, which If you are a fan of, would be much to your liking. So am I in a longue ? Or is this a sports bar? The interiors are done up nice though the seating is not comfortable, the seating (longue inspired) is stiff ! Few drinks in and the obvious happens, the furniture does not really both you. J The roof-top is a great place to sit if the weather is right, although they do have an outdoor air conditioning set up. The drinks are well priced for a place of this size and ambiance in the heart of Connaught place. The food is not really spectacular but still okay since there is good music and a hell lot of space for you to be seated in. This place essentially borrows elements from a sports caf and a longue, trying to merge both the concepts. So the low expectations with the food and the great expectations on value for money priced drinks takes the upper hand. They have a unique concept of having a discount on the food item on the date, as per their calendar, which is a nice thing to discuss, especially if looking for the food that corresponds to your birthdate, as the effects of the drinks begin to settle in. I remember Chilli chicken was the one corresponding to my birthdate. J Overall: VFM: Yes Tastebuds: Few drinks and everything will be excellent, but not bad in reality ! Ambiance: Oh la la Service: Quick Wow Factor: The hype is genuine, you must visit this place while its young ----- 06 Jul, 2013 ----- One of those places you must hit with friends !!! Warehouse cafe is CPs most amazing lounge's, playing familiar house music and serving a good selection of food and drinks ... The place is definitely VFM and light on the wallet ...but what you pay for is what you get, in terms of food The lounge is big enough so a group of friends is highly recommended .. The ambience is friendly and not shady ..... Disclaimer: Since I have a few followers who sort of like my reviews and go by it, I would like to state a few things: I try to review each restaurant basis the rating that they deserve individually, instead of comparing them with others. Each restaurant falls into a certain league, hence I try not to compare a 5 star with a dhabha. My rating is the overall experience one gets at a restaurant and includes the value for money, food, ambiance, service (delivery or dine in) and the wow factor (things that stand out). My tastes are what majority of us Indians like to eat, so I don't usually review the lobster as much as I review the chicken.",Rated 3.5,70,135,??
Amit M,Rated After reading a lot of positive reviews online and hearing from friends who have been there already finally I decided to drop in on 8th march 2014 with my wife. We dropped in at near to midnight but oh boy! The fully crowded atmosphere inside would just make you believe that its just 7 or 8 Pm outside. We somehow with help from courteous staff and after almost 20 min of waiting managed to get a place. Food: The food served was good and I give 4 out of 5 for that. Ambiance: For those who dont like eating out in dark places this is not a place for you Place is dark and the Hookah (which you will find normally on every table) and its smoke all around makes it more of a place likable by people of specific taste Service: Service is good overall but expect delays in order due to heavy crowd on weekends. The staff often would ignore your request as mostly at crowded time they are handling way too much per person and you have to keep reminding them of your order and other things. In my case the bill was even calculated wrong and even after pointing it to staff he simply ignored it and tried to get away stating the total is taken care with correct amount which was not true at all. So the WareHouse management if you do read and care about the reviews given here I still have the bill with me in case to decide to make up for it :),Rated 3.5,1,0,??

Shayeri Roy Choudhury,"Rated Considering it is one of the most talked about places in CP in the recent times, it hardly comes as a surprise that Warehouse cafe will blow your mind, or at least, leave you satisfied. Ambiance: spacious and top notch. They have everything, from semiprivate booths, to lavish couches, to simple dining tables for a quick bite. The lighting is a bit too dark for my fancy, I usually like to see what I'm eating, but no biggie. Food: Whenever one goes to a lounge that has no particular specialty cuisine, one immediately settles for the pizzas and pastas (easiest options). We decided to shun that cliche, and try something different. So mutton biryani it was. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the biryani came in an earthen vessel, complete with the traditional ""atta"" seal, which the waiter opened at our table. The mutton was soft and succulent, almost melted in my mouth. Some of the best I've had in recent times.The warehouse special kebabs were good too. The chocolate hazelnut shake that I tried was like a little bit of childhood in my mouth :) I believe that if a restaurant can cook up a mean biryani and kebabs, they'd be proficient at pretty much everything else. Cheers to the happy and agile waiters. Always quick and courteous. Will I return there? Of course, when I have a lot of cash in my kitty. It's not a place for frugal dinners.",Rated 4.5,21,182,??
Varun Srivastava,"Rated I have developed a very experiential view of the service industry in Delhi. I have slowly come to realise how the demography plays a major role in defining the hospitality of a restaurant with stark difference as you move from Central Delhi to South Delhi. This one happens to be the victim of such transition. When the lounge debuted, I happen to visit the place and as with any new restaurant, service, food, ambience all were great. As I kept visiting this place, I slowly realised how the service was deteriorating. And I totaly stand the transitive demographic difference accountable for the deplorable service which stands now. A restaurants capability of handling customer is not measured when it is half full but when the pressure is high like on weekends and you don't get the right service despite paying the hefty bills which you could have easily gotten at any other Vasant Kunj (VK) joint. I currently consider VK restaurants, malls and shopping places to be having the best service capability among all joints in Delhi. Warehouse cafe is a decent place but lately has acquired that sluggish attitude towards serving its customers which is of the paramount imporatnce to any patron. Their food is decent and menu is well defined, ambience is incredible but the service is quiet poor. I really hope they improve upon their shortcomings and try to bring more class into their operations.",Rated 2.5,102,503,??
Sudipto Roy,"Rated First impression - The place is huge, nice decor, has awesome seating and layout inside, has a decent selection to offer AND the terrace has a VIEW. An Amazing view, with the spectacular new national flag in CP fluttering in front of your eyes. But it goes kinda down, here onwards. The food is good in parts. Example - their Chicken BBQ Strips are awesome, but the Chicken burger is crap. Worse than a McChicken! Their selection of beer doesn't have any stouts or ales. The LIIT wasn't mixed right but was just about ok. And for the WORST part- Wherever you are you are bombarded by smoke. People smoking right next to where you're seated on the terrace. People smoking on the floors inside (illegal?). A mixed experience overall.",Rated 3.0,25,127,??
Shruti Bhat,"Rated In spite of this place being in CP, which is such a convenient place for me to go to, I have never been able to come to Warehouse Cafe till the last couple of weeks. And in the last two weeks, I have landed at this place twice already. It's a place that can drive any night-blind person away. It's dim - like, very dim. Be sure that you grab the sleeve of the person you've come here with - you just about might sit at the wrong table with the wrong person, have your meal, pay the bill and, on reaching downstairs, wonder if the person got plastic surgery in an hour a la Ekta Kapoor style. Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit. But yes, if you don't like dim places, and loud music as well, then the first floor is not for you. Luckily, they have a nice rooftop, with better lighting and an environment conducive to having a conversation without calling for a loudspeaker to help you. Their menu is vast. You have a lot of choices here, and that can lead you to poring over the menu for a good 10 minutes at the least and emerging super-confused and super-hungry. In two trips to this place, I tried the following dishes here: Mushroom Kurkure - They're a bit different from probably what I was expecting them to be. I was expecting super crispy/crunchy mushrooms. However, these came in a delicate crispy shell, with a beautifully crumbly stuffing. It was a slightly messy dish to eat since the mushrooms kept wanting to escape their shells (which were amazing), but sometimes food should be messy and should remind you of the time you were five years old and couldn't eat food without first chasing it around on your plate with your fork. Dahi ke Kebab - These were brilliant! They were just so soft that they melted in my mouth. It is not heavily spiced at all, and is a superb dish to try. It comes with some chutney, which is good, but not special. But the kebabs, oh yes, they are. Penne a la Verdure - We had this in pink sauce, and it was delicious. The quantity of the sauce was just right and covered the entire inside of the tubular structure of the penne, which is what I look for when I'm having a penne dish. It has a lot of veggies and tastes really good. Grilled Cottage Cheese Panini - I love paninis, though I am not a huge fan of cottage cheese. But being vegetarian means that you do end up eating quite a lot of cottage cheese. My first choice for a panini was the Tomato Basil Pesto Panini, which turned out to be non-vegetarian. So, the Grilled Cottage Cheese Panini landed on my plate. And it was pretty darn delicious! The cottage cheese filling kept wanting to feed itself to my clothes, which I happened to avoid by reasons that could only be attributed to magic. It was dish that was amazing, and I would love to have it again. Pizza a la Verdure - Now, for the one dish that I did not like. At all. I have had pizza a la verdure elsewhere. It's just a pizza with a lot of different types of veggies as toppings. Now, I have had this at one other place which rhymes with Doom Locks, and I love it over there. I did not want to compare it since each chef prepares food in his own style, and comparisons aren't always fair. But the veggies on the Pizza a la Verdure at the Warehouse Cafe felt slimy. I doused my pizza with what felt like half a kilo of oregano and chilli flakes, and they still couldn't distract me from how the pizza felt and tasted. I would not prefer to have this dish from here again. One word of caution - the quantities here are huge! And the food is very filling. So, while the prices seem to be a bit on the higher side, they are pretty much worth it. The service is a bit slow. The pricing comes to about Rs. 700-Rs. 1000 per person without alcohol. Recommended.",Rated 4.0,76,717,??
Sheena_Siddharth,"Rated This place is nicely tucked in the congested inner circle of Connaught Place. We were greeted by a lady standing in front of a suave lift door telling us that the place is running on a 25-30 minutes of waiting (we went on a Saturday). We told her that we are okay to stand by the bar and entered the lift. The lift swiftly took us to the first floor and there we were. The place is huge! Aptly spacious!! And despite being warned about the waiting time, we were immediately escorted to a seat. As we looked around there were other seats lying vacant as well. So why the hype about waiting?? Anyhow! We ordered Hoegaarden draught, chicken and cheese nachos and chicken sausage pizza. The beer came in no time. We asked the waiter for chilled (frosted) beer mugs, however, we were told that the glasses arent chilled only the beer is! (For a drinking place, its a crime not to have the frosted beer mugs!!) The food followed and it was good enough, both portion-wise and taste-wise. We had our food listening to the average music that was being played and looking at a giant screen where a cricket match was being aired. Interestingly, at the time of bill payment, we had to divulge our credit card pin to the waiter as there was no provision for us to punch in the pin on our own. Now thats weird!! Overall, it was fine. However, the service could have been better, in fact way better!!",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Lav,"Rated Being a Delhiite, I always have this disappointment about the lack of good open air restaurants and pubs. Warehouse Cafe brought a lot of calm to that bitter emotion in my heart. First up I had not been to CP after all the renovations and stuff so I really had no idea about what I was going to find. We got a large rable on the roof and the view of the Indian flag flying high at the central park. Totally awesome. Their sitting space inside is great by the way. The beer was great also. The only pain point for me was that at this price point I would want the food to be a little more finger lickin'. Don't get me wrong though - all the starters we ordered were served well and looked great. For main course I had ordered a burger which was quite crunchy and kind of had everything going, except for that something missing in the taste. The overall portion size also can be improved. All this said, Connaught Place is back with a bang and Warehouse Cafe definitely is one of those shining jewels in its crown. I definitely recommend this place for a great beer, snacks and tons of chit chat with friends. Hopefully the chef will also take my message and add that missing bit of taste. Please do go.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The main restaurant is on 1st floor & gives a real warehouse like look & feel. Seating at most of the places is such that it makes it really hard to communicate and is very dimly lit so all the more, the companion is easily ignored. Good place to have fun with friends when you are in a mood to talk at top of your voice. I doubt wives will like it. Warehouse special pizza was awesome, don't expect staff to treat you very nicely.

Great variety and quality of food, along with alcohol and hookah.

On a winter cum spring night, it's just feels awesome to be here.

FOOD : The food is good though I have tried out a few appetisers - Chicken Tikka, Chicken 65 & Drums of Heaven. The main course was good too , we only tried out non-veg dishes and they tasted awesome. DRINKS: Apart from the food there are good offers on liquor ( the more you order the lesser the drinks cost) The sheesha was okay lasted for 40-45 mins. SERVICE: Very friendly staff and service.

Food: We ordered half an half pizza of two different toppings, mushroom and warehouse special pizza, Lamb Cheese burger, Fancy Wasabi and Ginger Collin mocktails along with a warehouse special Hookah.

You get just 4 chicken wings(although an absolutely delight) for around 500 bucks. (incl of taxes) Must go. It is one of the best feel-good places to be in, in Delhi.",Rated 4.0,10,103,??

Mayankaggarwal.dce,"Rated Okay, this might look like the grudge of one bad experience, but then one must ask is it just a stroke of luck or some cellestial alignment that these experience happen, or its that one is so inebriabted that when one leaves the place that one forgets the sheer incompetence exhibited throughout the whole chain of command. So for those who still are interested, here's the experience: We reached the place at 9 PM the person at the front, didn't have a clue whether there was any waiting, and if so how much time would it take, on top of that he wasn't even taking a note of people in waiting. We left him in the same confused state we met him in and reached the floor. Even on the floor, we couldn't find anyone to attend to us, we asked about 5 attenders to help us out or alteast direct us to a person in authority. Its good that they seemed pretty busy serving people already seated, though when being served we didn't get even an average performance, but more on that later. So, after raising a little racket, which seemed the only way to get the bedlam in order, we finally got a rickety table just a tad too small for our food and drinks. The food provided short relief only to be let down by clumsy service. In the end it boils down to only one question, was the experience worth my money & time ? For this one it was not.",Rated 2.5,1,0,??

Divya Arya,"Rated Though the place is a little shady, mainly due to the lighting but it is definitely a must try. The menu is full of options, more than I have seen anywhere else. The menu is in the form of a calendar so if u go on a particular day, you get 50% off on that particular dish. I had ordered Penne alfredo, which was delicious, must say better than big chill. Their veg stroganoff was very good, though I wish they had it in red sauce, since it was in white sauce. The only disappointment was the veg lasagne, it was extremely dry and full of carrots and beans. The portions are huge. A dish can be shared by 2 people easily. So its definitely worth a try. The staff is very friendly and even ask at the end how they can be better. I didn't know about the discount by using amex card but before getting the bill they came and asked if I had an amex card.

It was beautiful to witness CP covered with fog. They have placed gas heaters, which makes it possible to enjoy the place even more. There are lot of servers near you to take care of you. The service is good. The seating is comfortable. Drinks and Hookah was good. Coming to the food.. We ordered for: Chilly Paneer: the taste was good but the panner was hard and didnt seem to be freshly prepared. Cottage cheese Skewers: It was a continental dish but i could not understand the chinese sweet chilli sauce with it though the dish tasted well. For the main course: Dal Makhni: was decent enough. Paneer kadhai: was a little bland. The preparation could have been much better. Breads: were average. They were not well cooked and was not crisp.

Then to try one more new thing for us ''Lasagne'' was what was ready try.... n again yuck.....is the word....

I started with chicken wings in chilly sauce and mushroom and babycorn with Thai herbs which was basically tasteless deep fried vegetables. The thai herbs were coriander leaves put on top of the bland vegetable, in a desperate attempt to make it appetising.But my biggest mistake was to order prawns in something known as xo sauce. It turned out to be prawns floating in oil and onions.I have never been so turned off by the very sight of food. The excuse given to me by the way is that it is a ready made sauce. If you want to feel cheated go here. Its also good for people who want to be totally put off food. The chicken stuffed with mushroom lacked any taste.

I won't even get to how the place was or what the food was like, just want to share the pathetic experience I had at this bar. I was on a date on a not so busy Wednesday afternoon. We both were in mood for some good food and I had heard reviews about this place hence we landed here. I'm sure for all those who've been on dates, you know how they work. You do not enter-hog-leave. You order a drink or two, along with some entrees, then the main course followed by a dessert. We had just got to the main course, when this waiter walks up to me in all decency, bends and whispers in my ear what would the most ridiculous thing I've heard since I stepped foot on this planet ""sir, jaldi karlo, aur bhi log wait kar rahe hai yahaan"". yes. those were the exact words. Now i'm glad that my date didn't hear this, and i'm sad that I was on a date and couldn't say anything in return or call for the manager, I just politely asked for my check, paid and left without us getting to the dessert. I have been to the busiest of the restuarants, not just in India but elsewhere too. But this just might be the worst hospitality experince i've had till now. It was insulting, blunt, rude.,...and the list can go on. Now i'm sure some of you might thing i'm overreacting, but trust me, if you step into my shoe and think if this happened with you, would you feel like punching the waiter in the face once or twice? Even waiters at Haldiram's wouldn't dare to talk like this. Warehouse, as the name is, has hired labor instead of waiters it seems.",Rated 1.0,10,3,??

DC,Rated Warehouse cafe feels like the place next door. It caught more eye when I saw groups of people standing outside the elevator almost ever time I crossed the reception. First floor is definitely a thumbs up for the ambience and decor. Since I visited the place on a Saturday so couldn't find a table and had to move upstairs to the roof. Roof has a decent CP view but the seats on the wall side are a Big NO. Couches are great to sit and chat though the Place gets crowded very easily due to less space. Food and drinks were good.

The guy would leave you with 2+1 or 3+2 bottles/pegs on your table & disappear without bothering to check if you'd also like to eat/order something else. Want him back ?? Get up & find out. Cancelled an order today ( courtesy reason mentioned) & nobody bothers to ask WHY. Confronted the Manager who initially rude then apologetic ( obviously). Enter at your own risk !!

Ajeta Shinde,"Rated I would say Good enough! I had not been to Warehouse Cafe till today though I was in CP was November for work. A week back while returning from Barakhamba Raod and craving for a good hot Arabiata Pasta, I stopped at Warehouse Cafe. Both me and my partner were visiting it for the first time. I am not to fond of the lounge culture a lot (as I said in my last review too) but I kind of liked the place. The food was good. I mean the Pasta was really nice. Loved it. Infact I loved the service more. I had some issues with their garlic bread which they told me were like how they were served. But I told them that I did not like the garlic breads and they instantly changed and got me garlic breads how I explained to them. A very short visit but a great experience I would say. Only one thing, we would have a 10-20% percent discount had we come via Dineout but nothing if we were a regular walkin. Next time, I shall keel in mind. I will surely go again",Rated 4.0,7,23,??
Nitai Utkarsh,"Rated As of the moment, Warehouse Cafe happens to be the most popular eatery in Delhi NCR as per Zomato with more than 350 odd reviews and some 1200 votes. Considering that the impact of Zomato and similar social media on the choice of what and where you eat, drink, or shop, it was not surprising when we zeroed down on the cafe for our office lunch outing. So it was that the five of us landed at the rather strange entry of the cafe (it is an elevator, no other way of entering the cafe except perhaps a service entry at the backside which was not visible). As we entered the ""cafe"", the first thought that crossed our minds was that the interiors of the place belied its tag. Rather dark (bordering on dingy for the time of the day), the place seemed perfect for a fun evening out with friends for a few drinks but could have been slightly brighter during the day to qualify as a cafe. Since we were decided on an outdoor seating, this did not impact us much as we moved on to the terrace which was oh-so-refreshing for a wintry yet sunny afternoon. We were extremely impressed with the rather large open air seating, bang in the middle of Connaught Place with a nice view of the Central Park and the inner circle. We had read bad things about the customer service in numerous reviews and it was just as reported and expected. There does not seem to be any attention paid to make the guests comfortable and if you need staff's attention, you need to really earn it. Expecting this as we were, we placed our order with the alacrity and loudness required at such places and that seemed to work for the order was taken down quite in one piece. We made do with pita bread with hummus, mozzarella fingers (cheesy fried potato poppers), Greek Salad, half-n-half Pizza, one half with mushroom toppings and the other with mixed vegetables, Grilled Fish with mashed potato on the side, Cottage Cheese Panini, and a fish based salad. To drink, we ordered a couple of Virgin Mojitos and some fresh lime soda/water based drinks. The drinks menu looked quite exhaustive but that would have to do with a subsequent visit, we thought. The pita was quite soft and the hummus had its flavor just right. Mozzarella fingers were quite the stars with the cheese filling pretty generous and the entire thing fried to just the right extent. The Greek salad was disappointing with feta cheese chunks thrown in with the other veggies and the whole thing lacking any sort of consistency. The pizza was rather bland with nothing that stood out, neither the cheese nor the toppings, and not even the thin crust. The panini and the fish salad were adequate but what really stole the show was the grilled fish dish. Wiped off the plate, this was one of the most satisfying variant of the dish that we had had over a long time. The drinks were nice and special mention is mandated of the Virgin Mojito, which seemed very balanced with the mint, sugar crystals, and the ice all mixed in correct proportions. The ambiance of the open air seating was quite nice as I had mentioned earlier. The cane furniture and comfortably tall tables made for some nice time spent soaking the winter afternoon sun. If there was anything that really got one's goat, it was the service. The delay in someone...anyone attending to us, to getting us the wrong order, once too often, and finally just the basic disinterested attitude of the staff left a sour taste in the mouth despite the decent food and the good ambiance.",Rated 3.5,29,128,??

Naman,"Rated This is one of those places where they treat you as peasants at a Food Shelter. The Saturday Night frenzy is understandable but inconsiderate behavior is not. The Servers were simply not interested in the customers, half of the drinks were unavailable, he was not open to discussions regarding the best combinations. There was no 'happy-to-serve' attitude: a pillar of the Service Industry. The Food and Snacks were fine, and served in decent time. I really liked the Shawarma Roll: it was very nicely done. The seating was kind of a letdown. The group seats outside are too low to enjoy the open view and the side seating is too high and cramped for comfort. Maybe the Inside seating is better, where the Manager is on Patrol. The interiors have a great decor, and the extended portions offer various seating styled options. Overall, I'd say there are plenty more better options in the vicinity to check out, rather than disappoint yourself here.",Rated 2.5,17,26,??
Navish Dogra,"Rated Off late CP has lost its 'hang out'. And unfortunately, hanging out at warehouse cafe 'wore' us inside out. To start with, the service was a dampener. I think mentioning self service on their menu would have served them far better than a bunch of waiters strolling up and down and caring to take orders only when they were tired of strolling. Beware that they will spend a pre decided amount f time on the table and you need to ensure that the guy notes down the order well before they vanish . As expected, to err is human and in a place like warehouse , to err is norm, they got us an entirely different dish ( our initial choices were not available ) and said that it can't be changed now. We ordered one veg dish also and voila it was the disaster of the evening - hara kebab. In the end the card swipe machine was not working which is a first for any place in CP that I have visited so far. Most of the others were also complaining about the shoddy service and bad quality of food/ hukkka. Ambience - 3 Food - 3 Service - 1 ( as we switched to self service mode ) There are far better places that give you a much better experience in NCR. Off the list.",Rated 1.5,4,48,??
Neha Mishra,"Rated The quality of the service and the staff is a very important aspect of all sectors in the service industry, it becomes all the more important to me at restaurants Im paying anything more than Rs. 1000 for something that doesn't fill my stomach or satiate my craving. This is because at such restaurants we pay for the experience and not for the food. Warehouse cafe falls in the category of one of these restaurants. It had caught my fancy ever since it is much hyped per launch party and a group of people waiting outside the lift every time I passed the lanes on inner circle. So it was finally on a Saturday evening we decided to give it a shot. As we reached the first floor and stepped outside the lift, we were completely transported to a totally different world. Kudos to the brilliant d&cor and the amazing furniture. The first thing you see as you step out is a long beer counter and you know that you are in for a great time. Well, atleast this is what I had thought in the beginning. Continuing the point from the first paragraph, just when I was done admiring the place I had expected that there would be someone who could help us with the tables as they were extremely crowded at that time and they had already declined our request of pre-booking (which is totally acceptable). Well there indeed was a guy from the management whom we approached to help us find a table to which he politely told us to go to the top floor since as per him the first floor was completely packed while the open area was still vacant. We did go upstairs but that place was all the more crowded and the staff there was equally clueless about any vacant space and asked us to try the indoor seating. We went downstairs again and asked the same person to help us with a table. He smiled at us and assured us that he would be of help and we as polite people waited for him to help us. But then within minutes I saw atleast three different groups of people just stroll in and grab a table without any one from the management even caring about it. I was really put off by this, however on persuasion of my friend I decided to stay on and speak to the staff about it. On asking them about their way of allotting table to their guest they did not have an answer but they did arrange a seating for us within minutes. I thought this was the end of the ordeal but I was wrong. The table given to us was just outside the kitchen and I literally had to save my head to avoid collision with the plates full of food every time a server passed by. On politely asking to shift out table we were outrightly declined saying that the place was full. Considering we were just the two of us, finding a table should not have been so tough. Nevermind. By then I was really in no mood of ordering anything however just for the sake of it I decided to go for the Nutella Peanut Butter Shake of which I had heard good reviews- it was again not available. Another put off.!! Finally we ordered a Chocolate and Hazelnut Shake, Homemade ginger Ale and Hawaian Chicken Salad. The drinks were average but after a few bites I realized there was no chicken in my salad which on asking them was replaced. But all this put together had totally spoilt the mood and we were in no mood of trying anything else. Points given only for the the brilliant decor and the decent food.

But the moment you enter, the restaurant is extremely low-lit. Coming inside from a beautiful winter afternoon outside is a bit of a shock. We ordered a lot of food, and it was all good,esp the Caesars salad. Some portions could be bigger though. Cannot comment onthe drinks, as i had a beer. Service was good too. No trouble there. I'd rather go for a dinner the next time, as the ambience is not for me. Great for the young hookah loving lot. Gets filled up by 3pm on a sat afternoon, and was packed when we left at 4:30.

Sparsh Oberoi,"Rated Finally got a chance to visit the Warehouse Cafe. It was an office party & we wanted to sit in the open. The terrace seating did not disappoint & I think that is the best part of this place. It is expensive no doubt but mind you, it is the heart of the city. Coming to the menu, it is a calendar & the dishes have been displayed date wise with different cuisines constituting each month. Interesting concept but the novelty lasts only till the first visit. Since we did not have a lot of people drinking that day we focused on the food. The biggest surprise of the day was that they were unable to serve us pizzas. The waiter said that they had run out of pizza base which is very weird for a restaurant like WC. Anyways, we ordered a lot of snacks starting from Nachos, honey chili potatoes, hariyali kebab & sandwiches. There is nothing extraordinary about the taste or the quantity of the food. It was an average affair. The service is damn slow. We were there by 4 PM & each of our order took 20-25 minutes to reach us. Even the drinks were served to us with a 10 minute delay. Here also the variety of beer available was pretty limited though the menu has a long list. It was a good time spent due to the ambiance & the view that you get of the central park. Besides the location of the restaurant, I do not think anything else stood out which can be really written about. It's a decent place but overpriced & overrated for sure.",Rated 3.0,34,253,??

We had gone on a Monday but the place had quite a crowd and when we discovered that a party was happening, all the reviews which talk about the lack of attention from the staff seemed to have come to life. But that was only momentary as the man at the helm of the service staff,& All Staff are super-active . We had the murg chettinad which had finesse written all over it. We had a glass of red wine and mojito to go with it. Coming to the main course, we ordered for grilled Basa and chicken both of which were the embodiments of our idea of a perfect meal. Served with hash potatoes and spinach, they really melt in one's mouth. Just when we thought, we had had enough of the surprises we found the real rabbit which had been hiding in the hat all this while; the desserts. We had a fork to help us with the blueberry cheese cake and the coffee tiramisu but in reality we only needed a needle to slice it. The staff told us they are freshly prepared and after a bite, we realized they were just stating the obvious.

Vishal Garg,"Rated Warehouse Cafe is one of those good place where you would like to hang out with friends. The feel gets even better if you can get terrace seats. Yes, the place has terrace seating as well. For all those who are not aware of the place, it has an elevator entry and is located at Gate no. 3 Exit of CP Metro station or its a turn away from Embassy Hotel. The place has indoor seating and terrace seating as well. If you are lucky enough then only you will get terrace seating. The view is quite good and you get a complete view of CP and plus if weather helps the place gets even better. Drinks over there are normally priced and you can get a LIT for 400 bucks. They have quite a good number of options in their menu. But don't go for Pitchers, unlike other pubs they serve a pitcher with straws (although you can ask them to pour it into glasses) but the quantity is quite less. I had ordered a pitcher of LIT and I could get only 3 half filled whisky glasses out of it. So better stick to individual drinks. Nevertheless, LIT was superb and the mixtures were perfectly blended. Talking about food, taste was impeccable but like other pubs the quantity was quite less. If you are looking quantity, you can go for Crispy garlic chicken or tandoori chicken or Chicken in Bbq sauce, rest all lack in quantity. The only bad part about the place is their service. It is very slow as in you may encounter things like you have ordered a drink and you ask steward after 15 minutes about the drink and to your surprise he has yet to ask the bartender and you may have to tell your drink again. Same is the case with food. My table was just next to the bar and still they were taking minimum 25-30 minutes to get the drink so you better be prepared with your list so that you can order at once. All in all, the place is really cool and should visit once with your friends. Ambiance - 4/5 Taste - 4/5 Service - 2/5 Overall - 4/5",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

To begin with, better to reserve seating before if coming with large party, even on weekdays. Warehouse has a very casino type feeling with wooden furnishing all around and dark orangy lights, which by the way makes it look perfect. Music is good and not super loud, so you don't have to literally shout aloud sitting next to each other. I loved the calendarish menu design. You will get good variety of liquor. Food is decent. Try chicken with hot sauce. Best part about this place is the terrace seating. Lovely view of Connaught Place from the rooftop. Would definitely recommend it as once in a while hangout place.

Prateek Khurana,"Rated Discovered by accident and ever since have become one of my favourites. Its easy to miss this place as the place if you don't really know about its whereabouts. So, what do I like about this place? 1. Ambiance - Right from the time you enter their elevator (which I found better than most that I have seen). I entered and mistook it for a small little bar with just bar stools until I just turned 180 degrees to discover a huge place with just the appropriate mix of decor, lights, seating, walking space. This contributes for 1.5 out of the 4.5 points I have given. 2. Food - Almost everything I have tried here was pretty good and mind you they have a huge spread across cuisines for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. The service is really quick too (except if you ask for water, they seem to take ages to get it, I don't know why). Another 1.5 points here. 3. Innovation - This is what I really liked and found very cool. Their menu card and concept behind it is very fresh and awesome. For drinks they have 3 categories - Retail, Wholesale and ""Warehouse"" and there is a certain quantity slab that fits it into the 3 categories. The prices of course vary with Retail being highest and warehouse being the lowest. Coming to food, their menu is a calendar with a dish mentioned on each day and date. The concept is that if you order for the dish of the day, you get extra discount on the same. In a sense its like the Dish of the Day. I give 1.5 just for this fresh, new concept on menu. Overall, it would have been a 5 but I found it to be a bit expensive when it comes to food quantity per dish and that's where i deduct the 0.5 Update - After giving it a 4.5 star and making this the ONLY place to go to when in CP and it being the first choice if planning to go out anywhere in Delhi, I would like to update my rating here. Nothing about this place has changed it is still as awesome except for the 2 instances in the last couple of months that I have noticed where the bill presented was inappropriate and incorrect. I would recommend all to do verify the bill not only at this place but everywhere else. I have noticed glitches twice and it is usually hard to convince them about the corrections. I don't know if it is intentional or just a mistake due to rushing things up owing to a huge gathering but ever since it happened to me the second time, I have stopped going to this place and am looking for a new favourite nearby! Also, maybe due to the popularity of this place vibes of arrogance are noticeable from the staff without much efforts. My original review was published in the 'Connoisseur's Guide to Eating Out' by Zomato and sadly I had to update it now and that too for this.",Rated 3.0,77,418,??

Sheetal Bahl,"Rated I have mixed feelings about Warehouse. Conceptually, the place is right - good bar/ pub aesthetic, lovely open area overlooking CP's Central Park, wide and interesting menu, etc. But there's a problem - it always seems to house an incongruous mix of people. In theory, I would welcome the idea of a place accommodating the post-work crowd with the families and the pub hoppers, but in practice, it feels disconcerting, and no matter which group you belong to, you're likely to feel a little out of place. So ""crowd"" aside, I enjoy the ambience (though the music sucks), the drinks are average, the food has some unusual choices which make it worthwhile, and the pricing is alright given the location. Give it a shot if you are in the neighbourhood - don't go out of your way for it.",Rated 3.0,76,265,??

Samrat Ray,"Rated Currently one of the most popular hanging out spots in the town..this spacious, uber cool american garage (warehouse) themed place is undoubtedly one of the most recommended place in connaught place... 1. Food: the menu is interestingly displayed theming on a calendar...with every month representing a particular course of the meal. The indian non veg appetisers are fantastic....i would specially recommend their chicken 65...by far one of the most consistently well cooked chicken 65 i ve had in the town... also go for the lahsuni murg tikka and chicken adana kebab...pretty well made!...in the international section, the sliced fish stir fried in chilli and coriander is nice...although tastes more in the lines of chilly chicken...the pizzas are average... coming to the main course section....the highlight of this place is their huge quantity...very obviously more than the contemporary counterpart standalones in the town...Go for the Indian section in the menu...the saagwala chicken, Murg makhni and Rara murg are the ones worth going for...the chicken biryani is above average....the oriental section of the menu can be given a miss!...the pastas are very indianised... then talking about the beverages...well i must say that the place has great options in the cocktail section..but weird enough though...all the signature cocktails like LIIT, Tequila sunrise are available only as pitchers!!!...sad for people who do not intend to drink like a fish!!!....the regular cocktails are below average...nothing great to look forward to!!!...the shooters are amazing...go for the jaegermeister bomb...costs a bomb but worth a try!!!... the review would be incomplete without the mention of their sheeshas!!!...the variety is superb!!!...my personal favorite is kiwi with mint combo....very long lasting flavours...n definitely gives you a high!!! 2. Service and Decor: the place is very well equipped with ample man power and thus, they make sure to deliver a very prompt and efficient service...you dont need to call the waiter time n again to change the coal in your sheesha... Ample space with widely spread out seating arrangements at 3 levels is surely something this place can boast of in a city like delhi..where restaurant space is always a problem!!!... The washrooms are well maintained with a guy constantly making sure to clean up the place in half n hour intervals!!!

Over a few mocktails and murg malai tikka, I had a thoroughly enjoyable time, what with the view this place offers. Over a period of time though, I have found the quality deteriorating. The food is served cold, often bland (vegetarian dishes especially) and it's certainly not nice when you can smell the flour in your food. The music is too loud and honestly, who has the energy to scream at the top of their voices after a hard day at work? The food is very very ordinary. I have been served a steak with stale vegetables on the side on one of my visits. Their crispy konjee lamb though was nice.

View is good and refreshing , sitting arrangement is adequate too. Enough of good points! Service here the most pathetic I have seen in recent times... Waiters are clear cut dumb and unaffectionate.. It seems as if they themselves are the most important people of all and are just pretending to be running everywhere except attending the customers.. Very very bad Service..!!!!!!! Food is good but nothing special and quantity too is okaish.. We ordered LIT( cause beer was out at 10'O clock) , half n half pizza , nachos and penne pasta.. Our bill was Rs 2900 which I think is little expensive considering everything was okaish..!!

Anyways we called for shawarma rolls and garlic chicken...served to us cold and without any dressing...

Pragya Bhatia Manocha,"Rated The much hyped WAREHOUSE CAFE!!! Located at D block inner circle, Connaught Place, its easily noticeable. A lift takes you upstairs and as soon as you enter, you get into a different world. Upon entering, you see a big and well stocked bar. With loud music playing, and amazing wooden interiors, warehouse is the perfect place for youngsters to chill in terms of ambiance. Spread over two floors, the place is huge enough to accomodate a largggeeeeee number of people at a time. When we entered, we were asked to wait as it was full and due to the heat, the terrace section was closed. Till the time we were deciding the order, our wait got over (pretty quick i must say) and we took our table. Then came the menu which i must say is really really attractive. Designed like a calender, it has a dish for each and every day of the year (365 dishes :O ). Its huge, like really really huge. You also get a discount on that particular dish of the day. We ordered a sheesha which was perfect with dense smoke. We visited during happy hours, but to our disappointment, only Corona (literally boiling hot it was!!!) was available and not even a single other beer. The chef special pizza was rectangular shaped, tasted differently good and the chef was really generous with toppings. As far as the servers are concerned, the are timid and polite and there is literally one server for every table. You do not have to look around and shout and yell for the waiters. The service is prompt and quick and gets a thumbs up. The volume of the music needs to be lowered down a bit as its difficult to hold conversations, else its a great place to hangout.

Its dimly lit in hues of orange and red and it transforms into another world once you're inside the lounge. The Menu was pretty creative, on a calendar each day was marked out for a different dish. there were a lot of dishes with a desi 'twist', like - chicken makhani pasta which was in fact quite palatable. The chicken lasagne we ordered was very disappointing, more so because it wasn't even a lasagne. Anyway, the food was a huge let down.

The ambiance is quite brilliant, with the whole place lit in a single colour (orange) and the music loud enough for everyone to have a good time but not blaring so that you can't hear what your friends are saying. Our table had great seating (royal chairs) and enough space on the table for food and drinks (not one of those pretend-table-for-4's). The guy waiting for our table was polite and patient (considering we were quite drunk to give clear orders after some time). There was even a magician coming to each table and showing some cool card tricks - that was some serious fun! Now, to the most important part - Food and drinks. Drinks: Although wheat beer was on the menu, it wasn't available - eventually ended up draining down a lot of Kingfisher. Food: The menu had great variety (for example - 30 chicken appetizers!). We ordered chicken 65 - but it was not what it was supposed to be. It was just chicken with a lot of spice in it. In fact, it was so spicy that we could not complete it. A mushroom pizza - average, nothing spectacular. Murgh biryani - Fanstastic! The music and lighting mellowed down by 11.45 - which was a little odd.

Ankush Mohanty,"Rated If a place can transport you from hot and sultry conditions prevalent outside to an area wherein you feel like that you are in a club in the middle of the day, then Warehouse Caf is the place for you. Having entered the caf at about 4:30 pm, the lighting of the place, I feel is the one of the USPs. The dim orange yellow hue welcomes you as soon as you enter. The place is huge and the seating arrangement consists of both wooden tables and plush sofas. As it was full, (yes, I am not kidding), we decided to share a long wooden table with another group. They have devised their menu in a different manner with the months of the calendar showcasing a type of dish Soups, Pastas, Appetizers, Drinks, Desserts, Pizzas etc. This goes on for 12 months and in total they have 365 dishes !!! (I feel it is an another way of saying that one needs to come here quite often to taste all the delectables) We ordered the chicken tikka and fresh lettuce salad, vegetable penne pasta and a cheese and chicken sandwich, virgin Mojito, Oreo and peanut butter shake and pineapple clove cardamom smoothie. The chef had the presence of mind of serving the chicken tikka and the lettuce separately and I had to mix it on my own so that the lettuce was crunchy for a long time. The chicken tikka was succulent, the spices were mixed in the right amount and the pieces were not that big also. So a thumbs up to the tikka. The penne pasta was ho hum to say the least. The flavor was amateurish as it only had oreganos on top of it. Other fresh herbs could have been added to give it a much better flavor. The pasta was devoid of olives which I feel are a must to add that distinct taste that olives have. The sandwich was draped in cheese. No, quite literally. The entire thing was covered with melted cheese and it was tough to hold it and have it. So we had to give up and eat it with a fork and knife. It tasted really great. The filling was very good indeed and French fries as sides were crispy and were air fried. The drinks the Mojito and the oreo peanut shake were top notch however the cardamom clove and pineapple smoothie was weird. Yes, I really use such a word for food but they have left me with no choice by adding such an option in the menu. Barring these few glitches, the place is worthy an experience.",Rated 3.5,103,370,??

Dushyant Sharma,"Rated Warehouse here we come, or atleast that was the kind of excitement me and my fiance had while we driving our car to this place. In terms of scale of the place, it's pretty gargantuan, but herein lies the first problem, most of the attendants seem clueless or overburdened because of the vastness of the area. The first and second attendant we encountered straight out of the lift, didn't give us a proper answer, they seemed in hurry to carry their drinks, only the third attendant was kind enough to tell us to wait at the bar area and he would inform us when a space was empty. So, finally after 30 minutes or so, we were seated. The ambiance gave of a variation of bronze or brown colour, which seemed an odd colour selection to me, also, the music played here was pretty, pretty loud, we had to constantly lean over the table to speak to each other, herein, lies the second problem for me, I love listening to music, but it shouldn't be so overpowering that you have to constantly rock backwards and forwards to have a conversation. We ordered the Cheese Nachos, which were excellent, it seemed the tortilla were freshly baked and were loaded with cheese, but we also ordered the polar opposite Chef special pizza, which was just plain shite. It was rectangular in shape, which was quite innovative but the taste was so bad, so bad, that we both refused to eat any more after just having a couple of bites. All in all this place is average at best, hence a 3 rating.",Rated 3.0,53,159,??

Tulika Sharma,"Rated After seeing warehouse caf always on the trending list we went there last to last Saturday afternoon. Situated in D-block, CP it was not difficult to find the place. The entrance to the restaurant is a lift as it is situated on the first floor. The lighted small lift transports you to an entirely dark huge spacious world which we didnt expect. The place is spread over two floors. Somehow it was not crowded when we entered the place. The staff was kind enough to move us to the reserved second floor, as we had a toddler with us. The great experience was the two king size beds placed in one corner of the second floor which we occupied. The place was dark and somewhat empty when we entered and did justice to its name. Coming to the menu. The menu provided on zomato is a bit old and they have updated their menu now, and provide a discount of 25% on the dish of the day. The men is extensive, confusing and tiring. And the worst thing, if u ask the staff about a particular dish, he has no clue about the food!!! They need a training on the menubut they really know how to take care of their guests (even the annoying kid). We ordered a lot of things caesar chicken salad, chicken n cheese nachos, shawarma roll, veg pizza, penne alfredo, bbq hot dog, cottage cheese bbq, thai red curry, fried ricefor the drinks we had hazelnut coffee, cold coffee with ice cream and a mango mint shake. The mango mint shake was amazing and a really new taste for my bud. For the foodthe best thing was the thin crust pizza among the appetizers. Chicken n cheese nachos were bland, even the dip was sweet and didnt do justice to the dish. The shawarma, hot dog and salad were ok to try but had nothing special. The pasta was a good choice and worth trying. The best thing in main course was the thai chicken curry which was spicy and tangy, but had very few pieces of chicken and lots of mushroom. For a group of four our bill was 4500, a bit on higher side but given the amount of food we ordered I guess it was justified. Overall Ill give this place 3.5* for the helpful staff and pizza n thai curry.worth a visit!!",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Gaurav Sharma,"Rated Great beer doesn't guarantee good times! Warehouse Cafe is absolutely brilliant in theory. Dark, Ambient, a lovely bar counter, Sheesha, loud music, huge seating space, exhaustive menu design, wide range of alcohol & arguably the best location in Connaught Place. The moment you get out of that fancy lift & enter the 'warehouse', your expectations are raised. Something to do with Delhi, anything packaged & marketed outstandingly well sells well. And sir, they just sold you the warehouse. No, it's not a silly building in okhla, it serves some awesome beers & offers a stellar evening view of Central park. So, what went wrong? Well, it's great to think big, but it works well if you execute BIG! The imported beers are lovely, and yes I do enjoy cricket on big screen, and I love the location, but then going to a pub, I love to eat too and I'd prefer it being served with a smile, Sir! Food, Service, anyone? Food: 365 dishes in a menu, seriously? They could have opted for a month or a quarter, but the menu feels like a decade. Frankly I wish there was a ctrl+F in the entire menu. The first thing, I'd obviously choose the day of my visit (50% disct.) but what will I do in January, I won't go to a pub & order a soup at 50% discount. More importantly, it is horribly difficult to find dishes in that menu. Zomato should charge 'em for scanning the entire novel..err.. menu! Saaar ji, no one in this world can serve 365 dishes which are all good. There must at least be some good stuff hidden somewhere, and I guess if I had ordered that, my rating would have been different! We settled for Chicken Fajitas to start with, and I'm not thankful to the 50% discount, else I would have chosen something better. By the way, it takes a lot of time to settle down, thanks to the entire city who loves to spend their weekend at Warehouse. The food was honestly highly disappointing. Next thing, we ordered some pizza recommended by one of the million servers. I was very hungry, so I didn't mind. But my colleague hated the pizza & the not-so-cool waiters didn't appreciate our gesture when we complained. But I was glad I found Amstel there, 2+1 wasn't a bad deal. And the fries, served without any dip, were lovely too. Service: For some reason, Warehouse Cafe has done well in controlling the unemployment rate of the country. They've given jobs to a huge herd of trained & not-so-well trained service guys. And they have actually segmented it into some guys who only handle Sheesha, some who serve food & few others who serve alcohol. And it's funny when you ask someone to get food quick only to get a reply, ""Main to sheeshe wala hun"". I hate writing bad about the service thing, because even a review here gives them some really bad time from the owners. But that isn't their fault, it's completely the fault of the management. And lastly, I hated the music they play or were playing that day, very very random & loud! Overall, it's not a very pocket-friendly place, but you get a good deal during happy hours. For 9+3 Amstels, 2+1 shots, fries, fajitas & a pizza, the bill was around 5500! The 3 is entirely for the ambience & the concept! Also, I'd anyday prefer the old-school blues or Route 04 over Warehouse!",Rated 3.0,314,2014,??

Aditya Raghav,"Rated In order to treat a group of 7 that was predominantly vegetarian, we decided to have lunch one day at warehouse cafe. In order to save time (lunch break timing), we ordered our food about 20 minutes before heading out to the restaurant. I loved the fact that the person who'd booked our order called promptly within 20 minutes to confirm our presence (we were running late because of the traffic) Anyway, as we entered, the place just made us smile. It was not too crowded and we also met a few familiar faces in the restaurant! We were right away taken to our seats and the starters were brought. We had ordered tandoori malai,peppercorn cheese and mozarella finger because it sounded like something different. For our main course, we ordered the Paneer Makhani, dal Dhaba, subz khada masala, Butter&Plain Naan and the Vegetable Biryani. The quantity was huge and we were left with an entire plate of Biryani which we thought would be a good idea to pack, and was graciously accepted by the waiters. Having talked about food let me highlight the other aspects as well. The service is very nice. Waiters are always ready to take an order or provide a service. Even the dividing of portions on the table by our server was perfect! They're not too nosy or interfering, but are always ready if you signal out to them.

Because he wants to seat some girls there. The behavior of waiters is rude and unwelcoming. Don't expect them to treat you well rather they may avoid coming to you.

Aarushi Sharma,"Rated I visited the Warehouse Cafe on a Sunday afternoon to see the much hyped place! Maybe the expectations had been built up by some great reviews or I just didn't paint the right picture in my mind, but it was extremely disappointing! It is located in the inner circle and is easy to find. The access is through a lift on the ground floor which takes you to the Warehouse Cafe spread across the first and second floors. Being a weekend, the place was jam packed and there was a 25 minute meeting for which people were asked to wait at the bar. We stood at the bar and thought we would order a drink to wait till we could be seated. It took us about 20 minutes to get in an order for 2 pints of beer as the waiters seemed occupied and disinterested in taking orders and the bartender told us quite rudely that he cannot take our order and we should just wait patiently as it is so crowded and let him do his job. The manager / supervisor happened to overhear this conversation and very promptly intervened to bring us two pints of beer. However, the staff is quite raw and crude and needs to be trained to be more courteous. We were then seated on the first floor itself and the service at the table was much better and not like what we experienced near the bar. The place is very large and has a decent seating capacity. There is nothing great about the ambience or decor. The food menu is extensive from which we tried a sandwich and a starter; both below average. The winning point for this place is its pricing which is surprisingly reasonably and seems like the pull for the young crowd you would see here. We hurried through our drink / food so that we could get out and spend the rest of the afternoon somewhere else. The place is ideally meant for college students and a young crowd with reasonable prices for average food and drinks, hookah and music. The decor / interiors are done up roughly and it does not offer much to write about. The staff is young and inexperience and definitely needs a lesson in managing the place better. It is similar to other outlets by the same ownership and I have hardly ever liked any of them. Go with the right expectations and you could enjoy the place. I would not recommend it as there are far better options for a pub / resto-bar which will give you a much better experience.",Rated 2.0,45,365,??

Piyush Tewari,"Rated Fail to understand what the good reviews are about. Obviously the guys who run OTB, Boombox and now Warehouse Cafe have figured the Zomato game. The hard work of their chefs is negated by how rude and corrupt their staff is. Food is good, no doubt, but the overall experience becomes horrendous when you start dealing with their bartenders and wait staff. The ladies in our group were constantly tramped upon by their wait staff with not an iota of apology. In fact one of the waiters was more than willing to get into a fight when confronted for pushing one of the ladies in our group for the second time. One of our guests got a chair with a missing foot and no replacement. Two guests were misbehaved with by the bartender when they refused to leave the change for him. Finally when the bill arrived, we were overcharged for two drinks - something I experienced often at OTB and therefore stopped going. The only saving grace was the food, and the guys who wear 'The Manager' T's - they are polite and try to help but are obviously swamped and have no control over the wait staff.",Rated 2.0,5,70,??

The place is spacious and maybe it even gives you kicks to enter it through an elevator (mostly cramped btw), but the main point of any restaurant, the food, is a big letdown. My friend and I met for lunch and ordered a penne arrabiata and a chicken shawarma roll along with 2 beers. We went for the safest options as it was our first time there. But how wrong can someone go with 2 of the most common dishes served in a cafe! The pasta was nothing too great and the chicken shawarma was plain awful, nothing close to being authentic. On the other hand, they have quite an elaborate drinks menu and they also stock Absinthe. We were curious about it so we confirmed with the waiter that it was actually 70% concentrated but they dont serve more than 15 ml.

Its definitely a place to hit with your buddies over beer and spirits ...and occasional shots too ! The all time favourites like prawn cocktail, dimsums, chicken 65, chicken tikas are always cooked to perfection and we end up ordering a lot more than we need...and surprisingly it just vanishes in No time...So the Food quality is good and so is the price.

KARAN VERMA,"Rated I took my parents out to warehouse cafe for dinner last weekend, the first thing we noticed when we entered the restaurant at approx 8.45 PM, was that it was full. The place is quite spacious and well lit. The decor is very tastefully done, and the overall ambience is quite chic. The seating is comfortable, tables spaced out, they have design menu like a calendar which has 365 dish. The food was good we ordered soup, starter and main course the staff was very courteous and attentive the whole time. Our glasses were refilled and cutlery changed promptly. The service time though was a bit slow. Although the soup and the starter arrived in a few minutes of ordering, the main course took over 25 minutes too arrive. By the time we finished our 3 course meal, it was 10.30! I believe this would be a concern when they would have to manage a bigger crowd. But overall we had no complaints because we were not in a hurry and the staff took good care of us. Location - 10/10 Ambience - 9/10 Food - 8/10 Service - 9/10. Recommended!",Rated 5.0,1,0,??

Although they can see people waving at them.The exotic flavors in the sheesha are really amazing.They have a good drinks menu.

What hits you when you enter is the size of the place Huge seating capacity, no problem large groups shall face. The menu's extensive, a dish for every day of the year Place & menu look good, we thought, reason for some cheer. Alas, the food disappointed, and the music was too loud Nothing made up for it, not even the dressed up young crowd. The penne makhani was 'different', a gamble which backfired Pizza was too dry, baked with hair undesired! Management indifferent, the dish though they did replace But the experience was lacking, perhaps an isolated case.

Fish tikka was an absolute delight, and I still maintain that its one of the best in the city.. As usual, the starters were placed on our tables merely within 20 minutes of ordering. For mains, we asked the steward to suggest us a good gravy to go with rotis.

But be careful for what you order as they hookah prices can go as high as 900, atleast that's what the staff told us. The hookah was decent , nothing to rave about. A vast variety of food to choose from was surely the highlight . For food we ordered a Penne Al Verdure ,which is their mixed sauce pasta which took a lot of time ,but was delicious. Even on a sunday , they had happy hours on selected liquor. One negative though, their staff is really cold. Its quite a turn off not to be treated well in a place with such standards.

Upon inquiring from some our friends and reading reviews on Zomato, we made up my mind to celebrate our Sunday at Warehouse cafe. So at first we enter and its huge, beautifully dim lit lounge and the music surely gets your feet tapping. We got ourselves a table within 5 mins. So i heard a lot about the pasta there and ordered Chicken Pesto, Crispy Chicken in BBQ Sauce and Warehouse Chicken tikka, i know sounds a lot for two weight conscious girls but then we were hungry! The liquor is very fairly priced. My friend ordered Adam's Apple which I must say is A MUST TRY!. The food is mouth watering and so is the taste. And yes, the service is the fastest ever. You don't get time to see what the guy next to you i eating and eyeing their food. You order and its there! They have seating arrangement at the roof top which is definitely pretty but depending on the weather!! And the best part, we paid only 3000 for three chicken starters, three mocktails, one whiskey and one sheesha. over all, I would say its an amazing place to be as it offers everything that a delhiite looks for: Great food, Affordable Alcohol, and a bill that will not hurt your fat pocket!",Rated 4.5,40,240,??

Arup Bose,"Rated So I finally ended up visiting the new 'happening' bar in town after a month of procrastination. The reviews and recommendation from people who had visited had set a pretty high standard for the place. So when i finally reached the place on a Saturday afternoon (Lunch time) I was both expectant and excited. Meeting a friend for lunch after a long time, the place had to be perfect to commemorate the mood. The doorman told us there was a waiting for 20 min to get a table for a couple and invited us to sit at the bar instead of asking us to stand in the queue unlike most other places. The ambiance inside was just great and for a change the bar seats were comfy & inviting (considering they are billed as having the longest bar in NCR it is a big requirement). The manager who was on the floor told me that he will try to get us a table within the next 15 mins and directed a server to hand us the menus. However the wait to place the order was long and soon it was 15 mins with no sign of any table or waiter available to take our order. However the manager jumped in and took our order personally (kudos for this touch) and finally arranged a table for us within the next 10 mins making the total wait for the table to around 30 mins. The starter, Mozarella Finger with chili mayo, was so-so coz of the cheese inside the finger. The main course, the tenderloin steak was cooked just as i had ordered -medium well done and the Pasta for the lady was just perfect. The drinks were just priced right considering the ambiance and the options available were pretty wide. Also good offers going on for imported liquor. So I would rate this place as a 4.5 for Ambiance and Seating, 4 for food and drinks, 3.5 for service (the managers courtesy and effectiveness got it the added 1.5 over the original 2) and a 4 overall on average. Definitely a place I would want to revisit soon and enjoy for a longer period of time.",Rated 4.0,9,81,??

This place has an amazing decor and great music. Though the 'Open Love' bed can be a bit of a put off if you suggest 4 girls to dine there! Thankfully they directed us to a better place and NOT a bed when we were just about to leave. The menu has too much to offer that it can actually take you hours to decide! It can be rather confusing! We ordered the warehouse veg spl pizza, veg fajitas and veg lasagne. The pizza was pretty good, though it fell short in terms of quantity. The fajitas had a lovely taste to them especially with the sour cream. I personally loved the generous portion of veg lasagne which was served. The pricing is a little harsh on the pocket but you wouldn't mind as the ambience makes up for it. All in all a good experience.",Rated 3.5,8,2,??
Raina,"Rated I was looking out for a visit to Warehouse Cafe and I did so today. Aware of the rooftop seating arrangement they have made provision for, I rushed to see that spot immediately. The view of entire Connaught Place was enjoyable from here but the weather was a mood spoiler- humid and hot so a big no no for sitting outside. The place inside was almost occupied, at least the spots where I wanted have a seat. Coming to the food, I ordered a Chicken Warehouse Special Pizza as to get an idea of how this 'special' item will taste and that will determine my further orders. And quite frankly, it didn't tingle my taste buds at all. There was nothing special about this special pizza. Egh. As far as the prices are concerned, the bucks I paid for this 'special Warehouse' pizza was surely overpriced as compared to the bland taste. This develops a big doubt on how main courses will taste like. However, keeping in mind all the establishments they have undertaken, this Cafe has provision for some classy bar ambiance. Being new to the crowd, the staff needs to buck up. I had to rise up thrice so that I could get my paprika sauce. My take for this Cafe is that it needs to be a cool breezy evening when I would love to visit this place but only if I plan to share a drink or two with friends and have a great time. An ideal place to catch up with people and great music with Connaught Place in the backdrop. One time visit is recommended. PS- Someone suggested to try the Beef burger. They say it tastes heaven. Not a beef eater, so the mystery remains !",Rated 3.5,6,8,??

Raghav Sethi,"Rated Finally a halfway-decent place to drink in Connaught Place simply because the ambience is excellent. It's one of the few places in the city that isn't confused about what it wants to be - a great bar, and nothing more. The food is pretty good, and the pasta in red sauce was well executed. I liked the idea of having 365 dishes - but I'd actually prefer fewer (but excellent) choices. The choice of domestic beer is lacking, they only had Kingfisher and KF Ultra pints when I visited.

Abhishek Ganguli,"Rated With all the road blocks and construction work, I had assumed very happily that CP is all dead when it comes to some great places to hang out but I was pleasantly surprised when I was introduced to Warehouse caf by one of my friends. From the outside the place looks small but it will blow your mind the when you walk in. Two well lit and spaced out floors along with an open terrace which opens to a great view of the inner circle. Personally I hate dim lit, small, tiny places where you are almost in the next person's lap or stomping on someone as there is no place to even stand and which most of the clubs and bars have become in Delhi. Warehouse was a great respite. The place has some great seatings kind of giving English feeling to it. The bar is long and we really didn't mind sittting on the bar stools as it was quite nice and comfy. The price tags on the poisons are a bit steep but I guess that's one of the things which keeps the crowd above a certain standard. As for the food, we had ordered some Tandoori Chicken and some fish tikkas. While the fish was great, the chicken was under cooked and a bit cold. If its ambience and the drinks which you have come to enjoy, these little short coming in food can be overseen but for me food is the most critical. I think where Warehouse needs a bit more finishing are on the waiters. I think they were short staffed the day we went and the waiters did look a bit confused trying to satisfy guests. But over all i think its a great place to hang out with friends and family. I shall visit this place again",Rated 3.5,34,56,??
Prince Sandy,"Rated As the name suggests, this place is indeed magical, calm, serene, beautiful, exquisite and very romantic. Far away from the hustle and bustle of the city, it is located in the interiors of a place that is surrounded with greenery. A visit here with your beloved is highly recommended. The place gets better as the day grows. Try it for lunch, sun downer or dinner, it will not fail to charm you with its picturesque beauty. Food is great and is for the ones who savor delicacies :)",Rated 5.0,9,66,??
Samyak Ranjan,"Rated I had a revisit to this cafe for a birthday party and that turned out to be quite well. We ordered Penne Alfredo, Penne Makhani, Spicy Cottage Cheese Burgers, Pepper Corn Cheese Rolls, Lamb Cheese Burger, Grilled Chicken and Mushroom Sauce, Warehouse Vegi Burger and some Adam's Apple for drinks I must say I'm impressed with the Pasta's over here. Although You can't go much wrong with the Alfredo or Arrabiata but this dish is certainly quite fulfilling. And Penne Makhani was quite what we anticipated, tasted like Dal Makhani, Oh but it was delicious. We weren't expecting it to be a hit and this was a shot in the dark. The Pepper Corn Cheese Rolls were sliced and didn't quite hit the spot. It was good no doubt but wouldn't exactly say it did the price justice. The Burgers were too bland to be eaten without ketchup or chilli flakes/Oregano (Which I'm sure I've become addicted too) Adam's Apple was a refreshing drink which was most definitely over priced. The Ambience is just too marvellous for me to point out any mistake. The service is although slacky sometimes (1 out of 3) so you might need to pump it up a bit there. Otherwise, You must visit this place once. ----- 25 May, 2013 ----- Warehouse stood up to it's expectations and delivered good food. So in CP, dying to go there, me and my best friend were greeted in the inner circle entrance by a server who politely helped us through the menu and also told us there is a discount today. Their menu was basically a calendar with each day designated with a dish. So according to the day, that particular dish would be served at a 50% discount rate. So we excitedly accepted and she pressed the button to call the lift down to enter the restaurant. HOW COOL IS THAT? Well it's unique by far so anyway when the doors opened, it was a delight. There was a very hip ambiance with cool music with bass tubes and a bar with a western look. The environment was pitch red and dark. It was totally what a cafe should be. So we told a server for a table for two and he took us to our seats. He handed us the menu and left us at peace while we flipped through 366 dishes. We ordered a Mushroom and Spinach Dimsum, Warehouse Veggi Burger, Watermelon and mint shake and a Adam's Apple. The first to arrive after 10 minutes anticipation was the Burger with French fries, Lettuce and slices of tomato as a side. Along with the drinks The Burger had a good filling and had a hummus like taste. Adding the ketchup and the lettuce piece the taste improved slighter. After we were done with it, Then came the Dumplings with 4 sides. 2 types of chilly sauce, soya sauce and sliced ginger. Looking at the dumplings, It did not look good and as if they were stale or something and we were expecting the worst. But upon taking the first bite, it was just heaven. Simply heaven. I think it was our highlight meal and even though 4 pieces for 300 bucks is a little steep (being accustomed to a max of 10 bucks a piece) but the taste was just amazing. There was a little mix up with the billing as they had forgotten to discount the dumplings but apart from that, the service was helpful and nice. Recommended.

Mohit Sameer Mehta,"Rated Warehouse Caf , Connaught Place, New Delhi. Today lunch; they absolved themselves of the sin of putting up bad food on our table this past Friday. Grilled fish for me and grilled chicken breast for Mike The food was delightful today! Our instinct to give the place another chance paid off! PS: It wasn't the tequila that made it work ;-) ----- 24 Jul, 2013 ----- Warehouse Cafe , Connaught Place, New Delhi. This past Friday afternoon we were going to our regular joint Spirit, inner circle, Connaught Place and stumbled upon this place, which apparently opened 4 months ago. As soon as the elevator door opens on the first floor, you are presented with an impressive bar area, ambient lighting, with club music in the back ground and a whiff of flavored hookah in the air. The beer, since it was happy hour was easy on the wallet. After having a few, me and my partner ordered food, reasonably priced again; grilled prawns with capers, grilled veggies and mashed potatoes for him; I ordered tenderloin steak with the same sides. Here is when it all started going downhill. No.1, the prawns were over seasoned and quite small. No.2, I asked for a steak knife and the server obliged (or not) by saying ""sir we don't have steak any knifes, A bit odd I thought since they have steaks on the menu! No.3, I some, how managed to carve into my steak with a table knife, and it was a struggle since I ordered a medium rare and it turned out to be on the verge of being well done, the vegetables which were supposed to be grilled were raw and the mashed potatoes were cold and tasted stale. No. 4, I asked the server to take both the dishes back as the vegies were raw and the mash was cold. No. 5, The server came back in less than a minute with our plates and said Chef Mr. Manoj says we serve cold mashed potatoes in this restaurant and that was an OMG moment for me as in Oprah of course not in a good way. The server a Mr. Manjt Singh was nice fella and tried to facilitate as much as he could, but I guess Mr. Maroj the chef will not have it. He likes to serve cold and stale mashed potatoes, World's first I reckon! Will I go there again: yes, why: To give it another try since the place is nice. I will make sure that we steer away from ordering a steak or anything with mashed potatoes in them!",Rated 3.0,15,33,??

Well escorted to a table in the beginning. After looking at the vast menu, ordered for a mocktail and a salad. Must say the mocktail was great to have and so was the salad. Something different and refreshing. Read the previous reviews here. Must say that they have servers in plenty. But a very mixed experience. I guess a little training would solve the purpose!

Deepak Khatri,"Rated One of the few places where I would never go again even if someone was treating me there for free. I have been there three times and consistently poor pathetic service from this place. Let me start the list: 1. Waiters: Absolutely ill trained waiters. You ask for water and it arrives after half an hour. You ask them is there another table, he replies I am very busy, talk to the manager. 2. Managers: No where to be seen till they take the last order. After the last order they promptly are visible and promise to take action next time 3. Quality food: Going from good to bad. 4. Ordered for a sweet and salt lime soda. The proportion was perfect except for the fact there was no lemon. it was sweet and salted soda. We tell the waiter we want to replace this with a mojito and he gets back saying cant be done. Had to have that thing lying on the table 5. The aircon sucks. Big place and very badly airconed. My advise a definite no go for this place. Definitely a zero value for money.",Rated 1.5,7,2,??
Vivek Sharma,"Rated Warehouse cafe being a well-hidden place and highly unknown was pretty shocking to me. A very obscure entry to this place can be easily missed. I found out about it through some web-search when I was trying to explore the best places to be in Delhi. I and my fiance happened to be there on a Saturday evening. On entering, it's a whole new world inside, with look and feel of Irish pubs and a little loud music which isn't bad either. It boasts of a nicely done bar. The sitting area is very diverse and offers multiple options depending upon your preference i.e. large tables for groups, smaller tables for 2 people and closely stuck-up chairs for couples. The ambiance is brilliant with yellow/ orangish lighting beautifully complimenting the wooden furniture. It really gives a very cozy feeling. Food - We being vegetarians, ordered some corn-based starter which was prepared to our liking. In the main course we ordered veg fried rice with mix-veggies in hot garlic sauce. It was really nice, not the best but really tasty. Drinks - We ordered 2 pitchers of Long Island Iced Tea and it was equally good. For couples they serve pitchers in a long glass with 2 straws in it. I personally think it is a good mood setter for a date. Sheesha - This place servers really nice hookahs. The flavour was great and the smoke was just perfect. The servers take care of the coal really frequently. It is quite expensive a place, so much so that we had to shell out INR 5600 for a starter, a main-course, 2 pitchers of LIIT and a single-flavour sheesha. However, all in all, we loved this place and we would recommend this place, specially for a special couple evening or a group hang-out.",Rated 4.0,3,44,??

Lot of covers, the bar is a big setup too. Great lighting, the music matches the vibe and energy. After reaching, we were talked into seating outside on the terrace; the mid floor was completely empty. Supposedly, a birthday party was supposed to happen over there. Some relief were the mist fans installed in the balcony, but what could beat the Delhi heat? Menu, wow. What creativity. A calendar styled menu with 365 dishes, the food article on the date clashing on your visit has a 50% off! Brownie points for that :D. Food, from what we tasted; salads were strictly ok. Starters were just fine (Portioning was brilliant), and the Pizza was well, cheese and a thin crust : Staff was friendly, they serviced us with a smile through out our seating time.

It was hot so we chucked out the option of sitting on terrace but i am sure the same would be ultimate in a pleasant weather. We started with soups and salad. Mushroom soup and Minestrone soup were delectable and hot and sour likewise. Not to forget: the menu is designed as a calendar.

Today I was surprised with the detail and attention of the staff and this was not even a Blogger's Invite ! We asked to be seated on the roof top and we were give a full sized couch which could easily accommodate 6 people . It was around 3.30 and could feel the winter breeze turning colder and colder as the sun sets . Food talks Phuket Fish - A nicely done fresh fish with a spiced up topping from the top . Like all the good Thai dishes it was balanced with flavors . Must try - 4/5 Mushroom galouti - The non veg foodies which accompanied me , raised a eye brow when say saw a veg Galouti . But soon they fall in love with it . The texture was brilliant and so was the taste . After Dhabha by claridges this is the only place which has made it right . 4,5/5 quesadilla veg - It lacked the basic flavors and was tasting more like a paneer Roti . The salsa lacked the flavour of garlic . Could be better 2.5/5 chicken shawarma - It was a bit runny with the sauce , did not had proper middle eastern flavors. Hummus was very nice . Missed on good quality pickles along with it 3/5 Chocolate Spring roll - Ahh this was heaven loved every single but of it . It had a hot caramel with cold ice cream with the dip and loved it .

Gigantic is the word that describes it as its the biggest at least in the cannaught circus area, it has quite a few sub- sections on 3 different floors. Everything I have eaten here so far has been flawless, some of the portions are tiny though, for example the pasta and the pizzas.

Though I cannot say I am disappointed but not much happy either. With a RAW look they have numerous sitting options like on 1st floor/2nd Floor & Terrace (with sprinkler water and nice view of inner circle) with numerous couches design and sitting alignment. so 4/5 points for this Food: they have big book of menu from which selecting a food is tedious job and also what I've eat i can say i am not impressed with the taste what I am expecting from my dish though i can say portion is quite good so can give 2.5/5. Drinks: Again they have some nice collection of beer, but after numerous option of breweries in Gurgaon I don't like to drink bottle of pint worth INR 50 for INR 250. Score 4/5. Huqa: it's a fading fad in Delhi now still selling like a hot cake in this place, not tried so can't judge them. Service: They are trying hard to look after you but still fail as there is not one on the gate to receive you/or guide you to take a seat, have to talk at least 3 servers to enquire about the seat which i don't appreciate at all. Score 2/5. (Also you need to order some food to sit on the couches otherwise they tell you to seat on bar counter) Music: i am not really sure what DJ trying to play here, it's too loud for a lounge setting and too boring for pub setting. Score: 1.5/5. Final verdict: You can give a miss to this place if you are with your better half or GF/BF, but if you are in group i can say that you can enjoy this place as they have some nice couches for group (and loads of option for group serving) and also screen for live matches.",Rated 2.5,4,21,??

Anyways we ordered Spring Rolls(they were good), Noodles(like everywhere else types), Baby corn and Mushroom in manchurian sauce(i dont remember the exact name apologies but this was decent), paneer tikka(this was decent too), bbq chicken strips with honey mustard(which was a little different), arabiatta pasta(really good), warehouse murg tikka(which was basically boneless tikka but was too salty), ..since the menu is too elaborate thats why they are not able to concentrate on each of the dishes, but i feel the best dishes are the most regular ones only. Good music, warehouse like ambience, nice bar, big screen in case of a match, different type of seating-sofas, lounge, bar stool like high chairs-they have it all. Its mainly about where you get a seat which would determine your experience. The high chair ones near the speakers-not a very good idea.

Food - Impressed with quantity of the appetiser & even with the Plating,hummus tasted great but it took them around 30 minutes to bring the food to the bar table,Really good choice in the menu. Drinks- Beer was served chilled without any complimentary bar snacks,pricing was okeh for a lounge of similar service. Decor & Ambience - Really great,Wooden pannelled walls,with dim yellow lighting & great loud music. Pricing - Expensive. Overall - Ok,but beware of the servers and their tricks they might force you to drink.. Detailed- I called up them before my visit,but they told me to Walk inn as i was alone.I entered D block and after a walk for around a minute i found a lift which takes you to the 1st floor. I entered the place at around 9pm and was welcome by a stewardess,she told me to occupy a place at the bar as i was alone and other areas were reserved,she even asked me to take a look at the open area,but i preferred to sit at the bar as it was really hot outside. I took a seat for around 5 minutes expecting for the bartender to ask me for a drink,but then i found the menu just next to me & then ordered for a stella artois pitcher but the bartender told me tht draught beers were not available,I was a kind of unhappy as i prefer draught beers over other bottled ones.Then i ordered a pint of Heineken and got the beer in around a minute.I then asked for the food menu which was really full of choices,30-31 choices for every item (soup,appetisers,dessert etc). I ordered for a Hummus with pita bread to the bartender,who then searched for one of his colleague to take my order forward.Hummus and pita bread came after my second drink,in the meanwhile i also ordered a hukkah which came in around 10-15 mins.I also tried to ask the servers for a different place as I wanted to see the semi final of the champions trophy,but they told that they will try. I had dropped my hotel card on my way to the washroom which was given back to me by one of the captains,I really thank him for that,but that server was kind of forcing me to take one more beer even when i was nt finished.After 2and1/2 beers and 10-15 mins of hukkah i was given the cheq(bill) may be they thought that i was going to run away seeing me as a tourist,on being given the bill I offered the server to place my credit card as a tab but he refused and told that we keep the bill running if u are sitting at the bar.I then ordered 2 more beers,and as India won the server came to me for the bill.But i told him that i need another beer and i have already taken one more,so please get me the reviewed cheq,he then insisted me to pay first then give me the 5th beer,which was really disatisfying,(thinking that I was high and all).I then paid Rs. 2100 for the total bill but i was nt given a copy of the bill. After paying for the 5th beer in advance,I was enjoying the last beer and hukkah and then that server came back after 10 minutes with the guts to ask me for another Rs.100 which were outstanding.And i knew that It was not the case,so i told him that i have already paid for 5 beers,hukkah & the appetiser & asked him for the total bill.After 10 minutes while i was having the appetiser & the hukkah,he came and told me that sir ur bill has been settled.This was really pathetic on the servers part to ask me for extra money,on being paid the bill i.e. 2100..195*5=975(beer) +295(appetiser) + 500(hukkah) + taxes. Even on asking the server for the bill,I was not given one & I left the place around 10.50pm.",Rated 2.5,6,1,??
Abhishek Jain,Rated went there last sunday with friends to beat the heat with few beers. the ambience was gud and its huge in size as compared to other cafes in cp but it was full and way too crowded. given the situation the staff was also not cooperating at all as i could find few empty tables but on asking they said its reserved and had to wait for 15mins like many others and then with no option left had to sit at the bar counter for an hour and then were shifted to a table after requesting the manager thrice. waiting outside is fine but once u r inside the cafe its frustrating!!! the food & prices are decent and the best part is the view from the terrace. they could improve on there ratings with better management and staffing.,Rated 2.5,9,23,??
Anisha Bhakri,"Rated Okay so after hearing an awful lot about this place I decided that I just have to go there! And then I went. Too bad the excitement didn't yield much. The place looks nice. Dimly lit, huge, loads of seating available, an interesting bar for sure. But what I haven't understood still is why they named the place 'Warehouse'. The decor isn't in keeping with the name. If you decide to go there, go there for a decent ambience, average food which is not very pocket friendly per se, and maybe because you'll see a lot of big groups hanging out over there. Another big thing about which I have been scratching my head is that in the whole wide New Delhi, why is this cafe #1 in Zomato users' opinion! I do not say it's bad but it is not worthy of first position either. I understand the eagerness of people to visit this cafe...it is but of course the word of mouth playing the role here. The cafe might be high-end but in my opinion there are smaller and better cafes in various other locations in this city and in Connaught Place as well, which can offer you more fun, better service, better food and a better experience in totality. This one has to work on its service in order to justify the exorbitant prices on the menu. Won't criticize the decor much..it seems friendly. I'll just say that we can do better! My review in a nutshell - an okay place, poor service (waiters just disappear into thin air), worth a one-time visit, the ambience is not as disappointing as the food. If you're going for drinks, then it might be a 'thumbs up' place.",Rated 2.5,59,199,??
Karanbajaj.in,"Rated Went with friends to check out the place, but it was a huge letdown. The ambiance was dingy - too much orange light is used. Wanted to order Hoegaarden beer, but they didnt have it so had to settle for a Bavaria. Ordered one beer, one dry martini a diet pepsi - they took over 10 mins to get the drinks, infact the drinks were served along with the food we ordered after repeatedly asking for them. In terms of food - they didnt have any pasta or burger, so we settled on one pizza and two chicken steaks - both were average in food quality.",Rated 2.0,7,5,??
Hitesh Raj Bhagat,"Rated Three of us visited Warehouse Cafe on a Monday afternoon - and I must say right from the start, this place is over-rated. It looks impressive at first glance - surprisingly a lot of people, a very large space, interesting orange lighting and warehouse theme - but it all went downhill from there. The food, the main reason we visited - 1.5 on 5 To begin with, they have a very very extensive menu. But on the day we visited, they had NO pastas, burgers or sandwiches - that's about 60 items struck off the list. They didn't have Hoegaarden beer either. The chicken pizza was good - but not worth the price. Smokehouse Deli serves way better pizza for the same price. Capri Italy serves much better pizzas for cheaper. The warehouse grilled chicken was bad - the chicken fillets were tough and smothered in a tomato paste. Really, it was horrendous. The mushroom stuffed chicken was strictly average - not worth the money. You'll get far better chicken at Q'ba, right around the corner in CP Later on we noticed that most of the people there were either drinking (with light snacks) or having one of the flavoured hookahs. That's seems to be about the right thing to do at this place - but we left wondering what we paid Rs 2600 for (our total order was three main courses, one diet pepsi, one bavaria beer and one martini)",Rated 2.0,3,0,??
Sanchi Jain,Rated Great Place to sit and enjoy the view of CP. Huge area !! Disappointing bit is Food which Sucks big time. We asked for Pita with hummus ( supposedly most simple prep) but chef couldn't manage to fix the half cooked bread even after sending it back twice...finally called for Kabab's which were bearable. A Lady( seemed to be the PR Manager or something) upon our complaint offered us discount but later forgets to communicate this to their staff. Staff needs some serious training and support. They fumble big time in rush. Bar is not full and disappoints upon your choice of drink. Overall a nice place to look at but lets you down eventually with service.

Aishwarya Bhardwaj,Rated When I went with my friends i expected really good quality food and service. But to my horror I was stuck in a place with horrible servicing and really hostile staff. When I had to make my order and enquire about certain dishes the staff had absolutely no idea about the dishes. Almost none of the staff was clear about the dishes and couldnt help us with chosing the dish. Anyways we made the decision and ordered chilli paneer which was served to us almost 25mins later and the quantity was pathetic..not even enough for 1 person. Then we ordered a pizza after nobody in the entire staff could explain us what was in what pizza. This was also given after 20-25mins. We asked them not to put brocolli and instead put jalepenos but it was vice versa. At the end we asked them to bring the bill which again took 20mins for them to give us!!

However, for places like Warehouse, it is worth it- as far as the ambience and food are concerned. The ambience was relaxing along with a menu that offered huge number of choices.

Arin Solo,"Rated So I came here again with a friend few days ago and I couldn't help but write a review about it. Just because I can't help but rant about their awesome peach ice tea. You have to have it. You got to taste it once. Ok so I have tasted lots of peach ice tea, but this one just blew my mind. You might not like it if you're not into strong taste. It's very sour very sweet and actually smell of peach. We ordered lamb and Hakka noodles for main course and some other side dishes which is forgettable. And they have this new system which I find it pretty interesting. They have this small electronic stuff kept in the table where you can press it to call for service or if you want to pay your pay. Unfortunately our bill never came despite pressing it three four times. You shouldn't go here if your looking for some cheap foods. It's not that expensive nor too pricey. But the ambience is nice though they really need to change some of the couch. You find most of the couch being torn or ripped off which can be pretty uninviting. What I don't like about it was the music was just too loud even though it was not a disco bar or disco bar. It was impossible to have a nice conversation. My fren and I literally had to shout. And the service was not that great....but ahh well what do you expect in Delhi? Good service? Never. But all in all its a fun place to be. A thumbs up.",Rated 3.5,17,84,??

And ofcourse the long bar at the entrance. I have never seen it before in Delhi a bar of this kind. They have sofa seating, high chairs, seating in dim as well as bright light. This place is 75% reserved all the time. I have been here twice and the crowd is mixed starting from teens to 40s. The lighting effects make this place beautiful. Now the menu..it is vast! The calendar style of menu card is impressive and innovative. They have 25 varieies of soups, salads, italian, oriental, beverages and what not! Their cold coffee and peach ice tea are amazing. Their penne arabiatta is well cooked, apt amount of sauce and vegetables and unlike other cafes the quantity is decent and stomach filling. Their muhroom kurkure are average and the item which u should never order is spinach and mushroom dimsums. It sucks bigtime! Their sheesha is not the best but just the rest. The flavour was coming in the mouth but later on complaining it was fine. After the billing was done we played roulette. It was kind of stupid but fun for 10 mins. It is not roulette in the true sense. If you get the number then u might get something complimentary. This place is cost effective unlike other cafes in CP. i will surely visit this place soon in the coming future for its pasta and ofcourse to explore more stuff.",Rated 4.0,92,951,??
Chandrabhan Singh Nathawat,"Rated Well Well Well, never saw such a exhaustive Menu, Literally 365 dishes, each meal for each day at discounted price. I was wandering around CP for something to eat with 2 Italian friends and we landed here.The first impression with the lift and exquisite interior of the bar raised our hopes for food. We went to roof top and must admit, CP never looked so beautiful before. Fans with mist were ready to cool you. Staff: [5/5] So polite and helpful, you call one and 2 would come to serve you. Ambiance [4/5] All good including the lighting and music, but there are inadequate number of fans on the roof top. We couldn't find a single spot where all 3 of us could get the misty fresh air. Menu [5/5] Most exhaustive menu ever I have seen. Food [3.5/5] Now we went in june so the meal of the day was pizza. Being with Italian friends we decided to take something which is not Indian and Italian. This was their last night and they were eating a lot of Indian meals for last 2 months. So we decided to order some sandwiches, burger and vegetables. (All veg for different reason for each one). It was good but that expectation which was raised could not be met. I guess some ingredients and spices were not rightly prepared. Overall good. Price for money: 3/5 I expected the size of burger to be large but it was not that much. Even my friend felt hungry after have meal. (We had been eating that evening but still felt hungry) Overall 3.5 They take you to top most level with expectations but only to bring bit down.

WhenIAte,"Rated Over the years, CP has declined in popularity as a place for nice joints to hang out. One ends up going to Blue's for their chilled out atmosphere and decent crowd. However, there were a few options outside of it. Thankfully, Warehouse Cafe has opened up and is redefining hanging out in CP. They have a vast menu that covers the 365 days and the dish of the day is served at a discounted price. What also works is that they have happy hours for weekend as well including imported liquor (we had 2+1 for Coronas). A couple of downsides - their service, while not lethargic, is not where it should be; and some of the cocktails were a tad to sweet The ambience is what works best at this place. Good upbeat music playing at just the right volume; just the right lighting to support the feel of a warehouse.

The place is spacious and i found it Royal.Rusty looking furniture which gives it an edge over the others.i was very impressed with their Menu card.Comfortable sitting chairs and couches. Warehouse Cafe had created a buzz among me and my friends much before this place had opened. It looked so beautiful during the construction of the place itself that we could not wait to see how beautiful it would actually turn out to be. Let me say we were not let down. We finally went there for a late night dinner. We did not have prior bookings and the place did seem quite full. We wanted a seating on the first floor which is beautiful. Within five minutes we were shown to our table. Beautiful interiors, by that I mean BEAUTIFUL! We started off with some drinks. For appetizers we chose Grilled mushrooms and Paneer skewers which were very tasty and it was indeed a great way to start a meal. This was by far the BEST appetizers. I have ever tasted For the main course we ordered Spinach+Ricotta Ravioli, My Boss's Style Spaghetti ( Red onions, mushrooms ) and Cottage Cheese Steak. The main was slightly leaning towards the saltier side, but that can be forgiven given that it still tasted good. We did not order any desserts as we had brought in a cake for one of our friends which we cut towards the end of the meal. Slightly heavy on the pocket but worth it. Will definitely visit the place again! I would like to conclude by saying that when you get tired shopping in the connaught place you better check this place out !",Rated 5.0,48,109,??

They have a nice terrace with mist fans n all, and even in this heat, you can actually think of sitting up there as their indoor floor would be full on a Friday/Saturday. The music though is very loud, and a little tasteless as well (at least I found it so for a saturday). Nevertheless, a 4/5 for all this. Now the important part: Booze and Food. Liquor is cheap, but their menu is limited, mostly the beer menu is (but then this is a problem these days with most bars). I did not find their service at the bar counter very good. In fact, the servers were careless, to say the least. We moved on to our own table soon and ordered a few starters (both veg and non-veg) along with a hukkah and LIITs. Everything, except the bong, sucked. The LIIT was full of only ice, was tasteless and the snacks (chilly chicken, mushrooms, nachos and a few other items) were poor. When I called up our table 'Captain' his reply was, you did not choose the right starters, you should've ordered what I was suggesting! The food was extremely expensive as well. 2/5 for this. Overall the place itself is nice. You can actually enjoy the ambiance with a friend on a weekend night or any evening after office, especially if you are there for only the booze. My rating for this place is 3/5. Lets hope they improve on the food and the service in the coming months. P.S. if you intend to do a lot of talking with your company, take the terrace as the music indoors is very loud.",Rated 3.0,64,140,??
A K,"Rated There were much expectations when i went there, but now I think I should have believed the reviews on Zomato or maybe I chose a wrong day. Poorly managed, loud color, missing items from menu, clueless waiters, average taste. The thought and efforts behind the place have gone in vain, the place and services could have been much better.",Rated 1.5,9,3,??
Deepika Jain,Rated The only good thing may be the location. Orange colour is too strong and everywhere and makes you uncomfortable. Felt as if they are only interested in having young college going crowd. Many items on menu were not available. Food was average and very small portions were served. 50% off or quantity reduced to half? Wanted to sit and relax and wait for family members but in 15-20 minutes wanted to leave the place. Thanks for the wonderful experience. Never again.,Rated 1.0,20,21,??
Divanshu Sarin,"Rated They have the right place , they have a lot of space and they have the right concept and they have almost done it and that too with a bang . But still the feel and the overall experience lacks. You enter the place helped by a nice lady in a chic elevator which opens to a large bar counter and you see this place spread all over and till you become friendly with the place you are helpef by a lot of staff members to get a place. Now the experience starts , some sofas are a bit uncomfortable so find a place for yourself with precautions . The menu is a bit complicated with a calender giving the list of dishes for each day. The service happens quickly and the food and drinks are normal with light music which doesnt attract a lot towards it. Now coming to some main points and some flaws which if corrected can make the place more decent The drinks listed on the menu should be available and patrons should not hear a no for their choice . The menu should be bit less complicated or it should be explained by the staff. The service should be more organised and customer centric. The food can be improved. The music should be more uber . Also please pay attention while preparing the check for the patrons or else if they calculate it later they would feel cheated. Also they have many good things which make it in the league. The staff is ready to accept their mistake and quickly rectify them and the prices are very competitive. Overall the experience it good but not so special.",Rated 3.5,52,293,??

Damini Aggarwal,"Rated I visited this restaurant last week, situated in the heart of the city at D block, CP. There is a lift that takes you to the restaurant. As soon as you enter, you see the huge bar but they have a few drinks to offer. Food: We ordered pasta alfredo and a veg pizza, both seemed good, even our chocolate shakes were pretty fine. Ambiance: -shady yet spacious, preferred by hookah lovers. - what sucked was the loud music, i mean it was really loud!! Service: -Really slow, the waiters would just roam here and there without any personal interest to assist, we had to call them 2-3 times to take our order. - we were not aware about the fact that 50% discount is offered on the dish of the day and even they didn't bother to inform us -the roulette table was just lying in the corner. -the pizza that we ordered was small in size and came around 20-30 minutes late Will i ever visit this place again?

Ipsita,"Rated Edit to the review: I've been here twice more and I''m not going back. I've never been to another restaurant where it seems that the waiters are really, really obliging you by taking your order. They will walk by you and not make eye-contact, or take forever to come after acknowledging that you require them. Extra forks are also brought when the dish is about to get over. There's no attention to little things that make your eating out experience happy, and that's extremely disappointing given how promising this place looked. Not so much a warehouse as a old british pub with an industrial ceiling. Full points for lighting, dim without struggling to read the menu or see your food. And seating is pretty comfortable too. Their cocktail options are a little disappointing, but they're willing to make what you ask for, so that makes up for it. Food was good; not mouthwatering quality, but well done and brought pretty quick. The service was a little disappointing as they forgot our second order of drinks and had to be reminded four times. Overall, though, thumbs up- they really do have a wide variety of food options (365) and deals on larger amounts of drinks( what they call wholesale). And the place was pretty full for a weekday night, so they're clearly doing something right. The DJ was good, the music never got boring, but it didn't disrupt conversation either. Will definitely try again in a larger group. I went again in a group of three and got terrible, terrible service. I'm still holding on to previous ratings an hoping its a one off. If not, it'll be a first dropping ratings for me.",Rated 3.0,50,95,??

Kanishk Rajput,"Rated Just went to try the new cafe last month. Here's my take on the WAREHOUSE CAFE,at the first look. DECOR - 2.5/5: Entering to this new cafe will definitely give you a feeling like warehouse. The wooden floor and similar walls in one section. The dark lighting just adds to the theme. But it's so upsetting when you try to eat your food. You actually can't see anything on your plate. We seriously didn't get to know what was on our plates. The only thing we got to recognize was taste of ingredients. FOOD - 2.5/5: They have a 365 days calender menu. Giving 50% discount on the items on their respective days. The offer makes you think once,whether to order the day's special dish or not. But we didn't take the bait , because the dish was veggie tikka and we don't like to eat veggies as much as we love eating Italian. So as usual...the order was our favorite Italian. The pasta in white and red sauce was fine. Nothing special... But the square shaped Warehouse special Pizza was very delecious. The taste was unique and very good. SERVICE - 0/5: The worst service you would expect at cafe like this on such a prime location. The servers just roam here and there without any concern of the guests. Honestly we're not going back.",Rated 2.5,46,195,??

Avnish Anand,"Rated We went to celebrate the end of exams on a Monday afternoon but this place was nothing short of a disappointment. The service was extremely slow, took 25 minutes plus for our pasta despite the place being empty. Our chocolate milkshake was disgusting, simply milk with Hershey's syrup added to it and that too more expensive than the benchmark for brilliant shakes in Delhi: Big Chill. The pasta was very average, nothing to write home about and overall, the place was overpriced considering the quality of the food. The wait staff failed to act when we told them the milkshake was ""extremely disappointing"", which kind of shows their indifference towards customer experience.

Its got a b'ful view and is very spacious.The place is spacious and i found it Royal.Rusty looking furniture which gives it an edge over the others. I was very impressed with their Menu card.Comfortable sitting chairs and couches. We had beer & starters. Starters are good in taste. Services are slow due to weekend.It was crowded.

Mohit Kochar,"Rated This cafe is buzzing a lot now a days, so me and my friends thought to give it a try. I was pretty sure this won't disappoint my friends as I was sure that we should have bang here, but all went opposite. I had a reservation for 5 but when we reach there, we still waited around 5-10 mins to grab the seats. As far as interiors are concerned, they are extremely sophisticated, thumbs up! The whole area has been done up quite well, specially the artificial fans that gives you feeling that you are in a warehouse itself, the chains tied to the walls, great, so yes the ambiance is perfect for me 5/5. But the area where it lacks is the food. As everyone is already aware they are having 365 dishes in their menu and 50% off on the dish associated with the day when you arrive, so nice concept. But the food really lacks taste and especially the drinks. You feel puked after having their Hazelnut and Vanilla Shake and not even this we had other drinks as well like Kesar kaffir Lemonade,feels like your are swallowing basil leaves with lemon never thought it could be such a disaster. The food was not even better then this, it is really a waste. Definitely if you are here for beer, nice place but not overall satisfactory . They really need to work hard on the food. Would highly recommend to reduce the menu list and work on the dish mentioned as even it lacks availability.

PC,"Rated Taken in by scores of positive reviews raving about this place, I along with my friends decided to visit this supposed new hot-spot in town, little aware of the fact that we were in for one of our biggest food-disappointments of recent times. The menu is supposed to be an impressive calendar-styled catalogue wherein each day represents a signature dish, thereby having 365 dishes in total. But, as the saying goes, all that glitters is not gold. After every single dish that we chose to order, we were informed by a sheepish waiter that the same was not available due to various reasons which sounded at times absurd, at times hilarious. Same was the case with the drinks menu. For a restaurant which boasts of having the longest bar in town, it indeed was a shame that their available stock did not match with their elaborate menu. Finally after a series of deliberations and overcoming several nays, the three of us finally managed to grab a drink each for ourselves. The subsequent experience was nothing short of a disaster. The food was below par doing nothing good to our taste-buds, the portions abysmally small, the drinks nowhere remotely close to what the actual potions taste like. In all, an extremely disappointing experience which was rounded off with a bill that further added to our string of woes. For all those who are planning to visit this place, beguiled by misleading reviews, let me warn you, that the place you are choosing to go to should actually be called Be-warehouse Cafe!",Rated 1.0,2,9,??
Niharika.Loves.To.Eat,"Rated Warehouse Cafe - supposedly the #1 on the list for current trends in the city has failed to impress me. Zomato, this one recommendation has disappointed me tremendously..and I am sorry. Except for the approach to the restaurant, everything else is almost substandard. Oh and at the entrance itself, the illusion that is created is deceptive. It hurts the eyes and ears later, just like a water fountain mirage in a dry and barren desert. The suave lift at the beginning and the fancy menu tend to lead you on..into a dull and mundane lounge like dingy place that plays outdated music where I could barely hear my friends or see through the hookah smoke ! Yes, they want us to fine dine while inhaling the sheesha cloud for which they do not have a separate section ! Yeesh. The lighting is so dingy that it feels more like a shady bar and the only solace of visibility is the huge plasma screen playing IPL matches all along. Thanks to the screen, I could cut my very very hard steak or otherwise I would have been drilling into it. And who knows, I would have ended up eating the ceramic plate instead of the steak. No difference, at all. Further, the service is the most outdated and slow one in the city. One Mojito, Margarita and Beefeater, which I am sure are not impossible to make in ten minutes, took almost an hour to be served. Oh yes, the dingy lighting must have caused the delay ! Anyway, they didn't have most of the drinks on the menu. Not even Malibu ! Moreover, the service was so slow that even after calling for the cheque for more than fifteen minutes, no one came to our rescue. I guess they didn't want us to leave. Figures ! And in any case, they don't really want to serve us so they left us alone for an hour while our stomachs were growling with hunger ! And when our order was served, we really wished that they had not brought it after all! As for the food and the menu, both were too bland for our liking. The drinks menu felt like it had been xeroxed from a local photocopy machine. Further, they have special day menus that have 50% off on them, which seems exciting, but is not. The mezze platter which was our 'special' treat for the day had some unsatisfying 4 tiny pieces that probably serve less than 1/2 people. The fish and chips were not exceptional either. Grrr! The crowd - Sheesha lovers/ IPL fanatics or probably beer lovers who hang around with a pint for hours. If you like such crowds, then Warehouse Cafe is for you. The bill came around 3600 inclusive of taxes. No tips this time. First time. Sad. NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE. Don't really understand the rave. Sometimes places win points just because they seem to be good 'hangout zones' without mettle. Visit it with friends if you just care about the liveliness and beer, and not the food or drinks.",Rated 2.0,441,6711,??
Rahul Kapur,"Rated Warehouse cafe is talk of the town these days and after visiting it this past weekend, I'd say ""Rightly so."" The place is dimly lit, the music is not loud and the staff is courteous. Their beverage and food prices are reasonable too. During happy hours, they offer 1+1 on beers and their inventory (Food menu) has some amazing deals. For instance, May has 31 days and in their inventory they have 31 different snacks, one for each day. So, if you walk into the Warehouse cafe on let's say May 7, check out the dish listed next to May 7 and you get 50% off on that dish. I paid Rs 459 for 2 Pints of Heineken( 1+1) along with a plate of Veg. Seekh Kebab (Dish of the day, hence 50% off). The 'CAFE' in their names kind of gives a wrong idea to people and I believe they should work on using a more appropriate name.",Rated 3.5,32,31,??

We were escorted to a table of our choice and felt very welcomed by the smiling faces of the staff. As we all know, the place is really cool but let me keep that aside and talk about the experience straightaway. The dishes we ordered were the legendary burger, Penne in Pesto sauce, California club sandwich,Pizza and garlic bread. To wash it all down we settled for colas and fresh lime sodas. The food was awesome. Though we were famished and it was late in the Night, we couldn't, as always, finish most of the food. Not because of the quality but of course the tendency of these wonderful guys to heap the plate up. The music was great as it has always been, and as it will always be.

Thats a different thing that its not gonna be of much use. Any place's sucess depends on the food it dishes out and this place does not do that at all. I ordered two pastas-one chicken pasta in white sauce and the other veg in red sauce , the dish of the day-andhra paneer tikka and fresh lime. I wanted to order some hard drinks but they apparantly had no license at that day. I was refused flatly that they cant serve liquor. The famous longest bar deemed absolutely useless on my day of visit. Both the pastas were awful tasting and were stale to the core to which i complained and was served stale pastas again after the first plates were taken off the table. The fresh lime which costs a whopping 125 bucks for a soft drink without taxes was below average. Only saving grace was the paneer but there was nothing andhra about it. I wont be comin to this place again even if they buy zomato and change its name to warehouse zomato(its on the top of top 25 because of some helluva marketing gimmicks).

Aarav Hudda,"Rated Warehouse Cafe, Known as a new paradise this had to be on my ""To-do' list for the week and visited over the weekend with my friends.This place is buzzing around in Delhi. It took a while to find the place which is situated in D Block at CP where to find parking is next to impossible. The place has an indoor and outdoor section which were both almost packed to capacity when we arrived. We opted for an indoor table, which in hindsight was the best decision. I love my Food & Drinks. In fact it made my entire evening uncomfortable. The decor and feel of the place was average and overly simplistic. Also, the chairs are good and comfortable to sit on for long periods. Ambiance: 4.5/5 We ordered the Pizza, beef burger and chicken nachos along with some Beer & Cocktails. The pizza was great, had a mix of toppings and chicken and 6 pieces were sufficient to half fill our stomachs. The beef burger was strictly alright although the beef did feel tender and juicy.

Srj,"Rated For a place which boasts of 365 dishes and 365 drinks, one for every day of year concept, a single review wont be enough so this I would like to call my first review of Warehouse. It is a little long but you can read it section wise... It has suddenly become the talk of town and it has reasons to be coz it boasts of many firsts. Like any new place in delhi, this too is becoming the go to place for many people and is on their must visit list. I have been waiting for it to open for some time when a friend of Priyank sukhija(Owner) mentioned about it to me and yesterday night I went here with 2 friends of mine. Location: If you were to find this place then it would be little difficult though its in D block,inner circle Cp. It needs better visibility on ground zero levels as for a place so big they should have big boards around but just have a small one outside. Its near snow white shop btw. The elevator takes you to the cafe and as soon as you enter you see the plush rich aristricatic long bar set up with an all wooden table counter impresses. My friends,Dipika and Prashasti had already taken a table just adjacent to bar and really liked the feel of the place. Look: The place has no connection or reference with the name as Warehouse aspect can only be attributed to the concept of the inventory that they have of liquor etc. At best it can be called an American version of a Warehouse which has been completely redone to look like a Modern cafe. There are wooden windows replicating typical exhaust windows warehouses, some tables with wheels on them, visible ceiling wind/air pipes which has become a fashion these days at many places. Seating is comfy and the sofas look like british themed. The lighting is dim and soothing orange lights all around. They have different seating options, like the sofas,chairs near bar area, stool chairs seating for larger groups, 2 separate areas opposite each other. One area was booked for a corporate affair and the other is a nice detailed area with brick walls, sofas and nice themed paintings. Music is good instrumental lounge stuff. Alfreco: They have another floor which is primarily for private parties and the terrace is huge as it is made by combining 3 terraces. Though nothing great, the view from here of central park is amazing( looking at it I can recall that a good scene of Special 26 was shot here if i am not wrong) but it was hot so we sat indoors. Staff: For a place which is just into its 2nd week of operations, the staff is very well trained and in plenty. There is a concept of Captains who over look a particular area which is nice and they lead very well. Staff is very attentive and agile, good with recommendations. Cuisine/food: They offer everything under the sun and all names are familiar which is a good thing but a little too safe. The menu is like a calendar and I actually kept reading it throughout my visit as there is just so much to look at. All cuisines have been given different months. Starting from salads/soups on January page to Deserts on the December page and all cuisines in between(starters,Continental,Oriental,sandwiches/burgers,maincourse,drinks you name it and its there). There are lots of spelling mistakes though which is a small thing. The 365 drinks menu was not there like it shows here on zomato and the staff had to suggest all kinds of drinks. They boast of inventory like warehouses but in beers only Kingfisher was there surprisingly. I went for their Gingerale and it was awesome. In the food after a lot of thought, the girls went in with Dahi(curd) kebab and it was little doughy but fine. Then it was the turn of the warehouse special pizza which had olives,cheese,mushroom etc. The pizza too was decent but not the best I have had. As with girls and limited apetite,I could not order much more as they were 'full' just after a bite, but still I ordered Assorted mushroom funghi bean spicy sauce(with special request of added stir fried veggies mixed) along with fried rice and it was amazing and just right with the sauce and veggies. I really wanted to try bhains ki aankh, Apple pie with Ice cream which are a speciality all over their other branches like Boombox cafe etc but that will have to wait.. This place really makes it hard to review but I have tried my best and a 4 rating I guess is a good start:) Usp: Their concept of Roulette table is a very unique one. You get chips equivalent to your bill amount and you play on the table and spin the dice. Accordint to the numbers, you get discounts/free dishes etc vouchers for your next visit. I really wanted to try it and waited for a while but the office group just refused to vacate it. So next time. This place is not the best ever but the scale,options and size will make you visit it more than once. Best for groups and office crowd for the packages offered. Also its from the people who gave us the legendary Lazeez Affaire, and Skooter, boombox,otb,raas,1 cafe, toast etc so you know that they know their job better than most. If not anything else they have given Cp a good famous place which will make you visit this area frequently. Prices are fine. Meal for 3 around rs.2500 with drinks.

Nangsa Lhamo,Rated Went to this place on a weekday so it was comparatively empty . The ambience was very different fron normal cafes in town. We had the barbeque chicken strips which were not that good. And otherwise too i dint quite like the place that much. But visiting it once wont be a bad idea..,Rated 3.0,10,142,??
Varun Thukral,"Rated went there with friends... a very nice place. Newly built and has a good ambiance. The amazing thig about it is they really have 365 dishes to offer and and the dish on the date is 50%off (though did no have it). Couldn't believe they have 3 floors and that to in CP. Has he biggest BAR ever seen. sheesha (huka) is a must try over there. It is here to stay guys, a must visit for foodies.",Rated 4.5,1,40,??
Ricky Teja,"Rated visited the place on a sunday night and its was crazy they have a roulette table!!!! Food- 4.5/5 tried crispy konjee lamb malai broccoli fried squid everything was very good and the best part about the menu is that its like a calendar, the place has 365 dishes. ambience-4.5/5 as the name suggest warehouse the place truly lives upto it. its huge and the best part is the terrace and the view from there. where in delhi you would find a beautiful terrace overlooking the heart of delhi CP location-5/5 its located in the inner circle of cp in D block and u can spot the place from anywhere in the inner circle with the shining well lighted terrace. A must visit place!!",Rated 4.5,1,131,??
Sonal Singh,Rated The ambience was really good and the playlist just improved with time. The food was average. The worst part was the service. The waiters didn't know about the options on menu and were way too busy despite very few guests. The overall experience was however nice mostly because of the lighting and music (and maybe IPL too).,Rated 3.5,3,0,??
Manjula Dhiman,"Rated Stumbled upon this place by chance.. Really!! And I thank my stars for the same. :) Usually, we do not venture out so far as to CP to only have a meal.. But since we were going to pick my in-laws from ND Railway Station, I thought it best to plan a dinner there and then go to the Station. And we were not in a mood for regular food, so thought of Italian. After much search, decided upon White Waters (opp Odeon Cinema). Unfortunately, they had the whole place booked on prior reservations (really?!).. So we were left on the road thinking what to do.. I told my hubby by the time u think about another place, I am going to check out my fave footwear store, in that part of the city - Heels. While I was checking out the display window, something caught my attention. It was the entrance to Warehouse Cafe. Never heard of, didnt know.. So decided to atleast see the menu, talk to the person and decide.. First thing that impressed me was their unusual Menu. Made to look like a calendar. it has a dish for each day.. and ya, not repeated throughout.. This bowled me over. If you order the dish of the day, as mentioned in Menu Calendar, you get 50% off...... WOW!! We decided to give it a try. and we were in for a surprise. I was definitely not expecting such spacious place in CP.. They have a combination of seating arrangements - bar, lounge, terrace.. Yup. they have an open terrace seating, looking out at the inner circle and the view is fantastic.. since we had our sonny with us, we chose to sit in the family section.. for starters, we ordered a chicken salad which was perfectly balanced in taste. Sonny darling ordered a margartia pizza with fresh lime. Pizza had a hint of basil and thus was quite a welcome change from plain pizza. Their bar was open that day (on a day license basis?) and so we could enjoy a few drinks too.. though the choice was limited. Hubby decided to have a beer and I chose Cosmo to start with. However, for the repeat, the server mentioned they did not have Cranberry Juice anymore.. so that was a let down for me.. For main course, we ordered Penne in Pesto sauce. this too was perfectly spiced and balanced. All in all good meal. Service is quick and attentive. The servers might not have all the information that you ask for any particular dish, but that is acceptable, knowing there are 365 items on the menu. But they would ensure to quickly come back to you with desired info. I saw the casino and roulette table too. Wonder, what would that be for.. Good place.. Good ambience.. Good food.. Pricing average.. Must try",Rated 4.5,63,140,??

Bharat Sharma,"Rated Finally got to try out this place yesterday. This place have excellent online presence. After hearing lots of words about this place. We were waiting from past one month to visit it. We went there yesterday with my friends to check it out. Ambiance - Absolutely romantic!! It is situated on D block of CP, The Heart of Delhi. This place has awesome concept. A roulette table & longest bar table. The ambience was amazing. Loud music & amazing ambience giving its a perfect combo. Warehouse Cafe is warehouse in terms of Food, Space & ambience. Food-Now here's the shocker. Menu has 365 dishes which was quite amazing for us. Just sit on the Bar Table & enjoy the drinks. A few drinks and food away from the hustle bustle of Delhi maddening traffic is the best way to describe it. We had a wonderful experience, the two starters and one pasta that I ordered were done 'perfectly'. Pasta's are something that a lot of places serve, but none make it well. And, from my experience here I'd say it was definitely one of the better Pasta's I've had in Delhi. So from side definitely ""5 Stars"" to the food as well! This would definitely be in my list of top most happening places in Delhi. Do reserve your place in advance, Definitely deserves a higher than ""5 Star"" rating for this aspect. Service - Excellent, non-intrusive and definitely not pushing us to finish our drinks quickly. Very courteous and helpful too. ""5 Stars"" for the service! Value for Money - Now this is pocket friendly place. You get what you pay for. My bill was 2.4K for beers,2 cocktails, 2 vegetarian starters and one pasta. The food for the quality delivered is definitely worth giving ""5 Stars"". The drinks were well prepared too, I'd rate the cocktails to be inline with quality. Overall - Definitely recommended for an fun filled evening with friends.",Rated 4.5,111,445,??
Rachit Puri,"Rated Wao...at the first instance I can never believe that a place, which is simply amazing & at the same time, pocket friendly can exist in a place like CP...As expected, I had a hard time to decide on what to order since the Menu is full of variety and gives you an option to pick from 365 items...The decor is quite good, they know which is the best music for a cafe, which is well played...I was in rush so couldn't try much but just had a light salad, along with Ginger Ale, which did surprise my taste buds....Right now, I give 4.5 stars, since I couldn't spend much time there...but will surely keep coming back to the place... :)",Rated 4.5,39,309,??
