review,index
not worth the amount of money you pay,price
rates are reasonable,price
slightly pricy but worth the money,price
their photo gallery is the most expensive part of the entire restaurant and they also have a giant bar in the end,price
"service was slow, portions are so tiny that they cant even suffice 2, prices are crazy",price
rates are reasonable,price
tonino's in cp offers a very good meal at a very fair price,price
price are also not so much,price
cost me about six hundred rupees so not too expensive,price
price: a little towards the higher side.,price
cost was affordable.,price
with these two and one cappuccino my bill was 900.,price
,price
the items on the menu appear to be a little overpriced but its totally convincing when they actually serve you the food since the quality and quantity both justify the pricing,price
drinks are at decent price,price
cost : just above average.,price
"disappointment, highly over priced considering no value for money",price
"if you want to be expensive, you have to provide either exceptional quality, a unique experience or/and good quantity (which would actually reduce the expense factor, but anyways)",price
expensive affair,price
we would have probably been less critical of it if the place was not so ridiculously expensive,price
cost person would be something around 700-1000 hence value for money is moderate,price
"the food, ambience and service is all value for money",price
ordered the square pizza whose quantity was pretty less as compared to the price,price
the price is also quite affordable,price
the food and beverages are decently priced.,price
but is quite expensive,price
a little heavy on the pocket.,price
for the price range pretty ordinary fare,price
this place is super pocket friendly,price
prices are on a higher side but worth the spend,price
pretty standard fare but the portions were a tad small for the price,price
"for the price specified, it was a tiny portion.",price
in short it's worth spending your money at this place,price
the food and hospitality are also great but the price might not be everyones cup of tea.,price
price wise its bit on higher side,price
price are reasonable (portions are good) will definitely revisit,price
decent priced menu.,price
"all said and done, the place has a decently priced menu",price
three words : value for money,price
costed us around 1200,price
"we started with two manhattans, a bourbon whiskey cocktail that surprised us both with its taste, some offer got us starters for free which basically consisted of nachos and peanuts",price
the whole thing cost us 2000 bucks which is fair enough for a place like this,price
a tad expensive,price
not all items are worth the money charged,price
"go here for a nice feel, but be ready to shell out more money",price
"it is however, an expensive place",price
"if you're looking for a great value for money, this is not the place to be",price
"a tad bit more on the expenses, but they charge for what they provide",price
value for money,price
but we thought that the quantity could be a little more (maybe the big chill has spolied us in terms of expected quantity) in that price,price
a little on the expensive side but still i must say save and go,price
and in the bill they charged the icecream separately,price
taste is ok but ain't value for money,price
as the name tonino has a tiny portion size as compared to its prices,price
"we had a good time overall, prices don't offer the required quantity of food.",price
value for money.,price
and yes it hits hard on ur pocket,price
pathetic overpriced drink,price
i found the place a tad bit expensive but in all it was a good experience,price
"this place is highly recommended, little expensive but worth it",price
i would love to see a larger portion of food on my plate for the price,price
"one thing i would say is the serving was small as compared to the price, so i found it expensive for the amount of food that we were served",price
"my issue was the price, i am all for high end restaurants and the feel that comes along with it",price
while this place had the feel quotient.,price
"a couple of cons: the portions are relatively smaller than what other places/cafes, along the same price tag, offer",price
the place is bit overpriced for the kind of food they serve,price
"a bit overpriced and nothing like the ""woah"" thing in there food",price
food with less prices,price
"not to forget, all this comes in just a price of inr 340/.",price
over-priced for the small portions they give,price
"yes, it is exorbitantly priced.",price
not worth the prices.,price
nothing was the worth the high prices of the place,price
but even the bill was delayed,price
"menu was comprehensive and reasonably priced, so we entered",price
being nearly twice the price of an average meal in india,price
"in all, nice atmosphere, good food, decent prices (for delhi).",price
much better value than our more expensive vegetable appetizer,price
"the bad,the prices are on the higher side compared to the serving size",price
the items on the menu seem to be over priced but once you try the food it does not seem to be too heavy on the pocket,price
"unexpectedly, this place turned out to be very reasonably priced",price
"the food is good and a bit on the expensive side, keeping up with the refined feel of the place",price
the most surprising part was the bill,price
"price range was just like any other cp outlet, probably a tad cheaper because this place looks new",price
cost- it came approx 1500 including taxes and all which is fine by me,price
"priced at around five hundred bucks, but was completely worth it",price
"the draught beer was priced at 500 for a pitcher, which was a deal",price
"and maybe, the portions were a tad less (especially salsiccia di pollo) for the price",price
the only best thing is the beer pitcher which is priced well but again lacks options,price
want to dine out at a peaceful place and ready to shed money then this is one of the place you can go for,price
but the bar will cost more than the food your having,price
good money spent,price
and all this costed us some 1700 bucks,price
the happiness that the ambience filled us with made it a 3 hours long conservation and a happier bill set the deal for another visit,price
though a bit put off in the end as they took very long to get the bill yet worth it i am glad to have experienced the place as i had bookmarked it for long,price
"they have sandwiches,pizzas,pastas,starters at a decent price",price
good value for money,price
easy on the pocket.,price
this restaurant serves food that is pretty much up to the mark but the prices are definitely on the higher side compared to the quantity,price
"prices on the higher side, not at all mediocre",price
but the food portions  are very small for the price,price
priced a little towards the higher side,price
a decent lunch for 2 without alcohol would cost you inr 1800-2000 (inc tax),price
"yes, it is a casual dining place, even the prices are pocket friendly",price
it all costed us around 1800 bucks which is pocket friendly,price
price - expensive considering the food quality and quantity,price
got us the bill and when we said we were waiting for our waffles they said it would take another twenty minutes because the guy who took our order left,price
the serving was miniscule for the price,price
after these two disappointments we were handed a bill of 1400 bucks,price
no discounts on any credit / debit cards,price
pricing they have fine dining prices and a meal for two may costs close inr 2500+,price
some might find it a little costlier however the portions are decent and taste will let you forget that,price
"we somehow managed to eat enough of it to satisfy our wallets, but it was a total disaster in every possible way",price
meal cost around 1500,price
snack platter free,price
"ordered the ""insalata caprese"" salad, which was somehow not enough for the price.",price
quantity of the food is not at all worth the price overall it is an ok place but it needs an improvement in its quality and quantity,price
"we ordered bruchheta, pasta and peri peri cheezy fries, all of these tasted nice but the quantity was a little less as compared to the cost",price
the rates were not revised and we had to pay more because  of the new menu,price
":( the quantity of the dishes was good and the menu's reasonably priced, too",price
the food is delicious n not that expensive,price
value for money,price
the bill came around for rs,price
caffe tonino is reasonably priced,price
it also shows that the makers believe in serving quality food and value for money,price
the bill for this meal came up to be rs 1300 inclusive of all taxes,price
and every bite worth your money,price
cost: a little over rs 1000 for 2,price
"might not be value for money, quantity wise but quality wise.",price
"it would serve you well to note that it's a fine dining restaurant, so it might be more expensive than your average eateries",price
cost/ person : rs 800 will i visit again,price
a cup of cappucino here costs rs 95 and does not disappont at all,price
5/5 value for money.,price
reasonable prices,price
it was a little overpriced but i'm not complaining,price
value for money - yes,price
it is a little steep when it comes down to the prices but great taste and amazing time makeup for it,price
they have made it cafe style so d prices are easy on the pocket,price
"all in all a good experience, with great ambiance and great vale for money in cp",price
"serving- good and fast price- nothing extraordinary, just like regualr cafes in hauz khas/khan market so you can manage",price
