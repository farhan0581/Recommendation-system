Just Delhiing,Rated As summer is knocking at our doorstep this is the place you should keep in mind when the humid Delhi summers finally arrives. And i can bet this place will not disappoint you. Located in the heart of Delhi this place offers a wide variety of ice creams. They have specialised in seasonal fruit flavours. The flavour of the ice cream is very natural with no extra preservatives added and it totally satisfies the taste that you have developed for one fruit over the years. The interiors of the place is equally stunning and the place is pretty spacious for an ice cream parlour. The price of the ice cream is not very expensive and we personally would not mind spending some extra bucks for the flavours they serve there. So guys if you are feeling the heat when summer arrives then do visit this place for some relief.,Rated 4.0,23,290,??

Bimal Agrawal,"Rated Wow - superb - Fantastc - Awesome -Fabulous or Simply Naturals. What to say its the best. The USP is their natural taste nd unique flavours. We tried choco chip, jack fruit, kesar pista, anjeer nd my fav chikoo. We missed sita phal which wasn't avlble. A real Gem from the land of Bollywood. From Now if its an ice cream it has to be Naturals !!",Rated 5.0,6,28,??
The Feast That's Life,"Rated After having dinner elsewhere, I stopped by the CP outlet to grab a cup of my favourite sitaphal ice-cream. But as it was not the season for the fruit, it was unavailable. So I tasted their winter-special berry flavours: raspberry, blueberry and mulberry and finally chose to have a cup of mulberry. It had just the right amount of sweetness, and was slightly tart as well, with bits of fruit inside the creamy ice-cream. A very nice and different flavour, and one which can definitely become my winter favourite here! thefeastthatslife.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The Great Indian Foodie :P,"Rated Earlier that place was owned by Reliance Communication and One day I have found that place is replaced by Natural Ice-cream.I just checked their menu which has limited variation and have regular option. I just gave a try with almond and black grapes flavour. both were good. Outlet : Oultet is located in L block, Outer circle very next to Wagh Bakery Lounge.

It is located in the outer circle of CP. It serves an array of sumptuous, mouth watering & luscious ice creams, that are different on the tongue or you can say temptingly tasty. It has an inviting ambience with nice dcor. The service extended by their staff are appreciable. I often visit this place.

Ruhi Madan,Rated Nothing that has not been said yet this is the best Icecream I ever had and different from almost every brand. My love for natural started in Pune in college and now that I am in delhi they are here too. My fav sitaphal and coconut,Rated 5.0,6,0,??
Gaurav Arora,"Rated No doubt the best ice cream I had. I got my tongue into papaya-pineapple and coffee walnut flavors caressed by a fresh waffle cone. I loathe papaya. During my childhood every time I gave in to my mom's praise for its deliciousness, I regretted the bite. But I took a chance. The ice cream has some pulp of the fruits which is something I have never seen. It is less sweet than all other ice creams of the world, which lets you relish the flavors each ice cream is named after. Must have. I had double scoop in a fresh waffle cone, so that costed me Rs. 130",Rated 5.0,4,7,??
Wasil,"Rated There isn't anything much left to say about the ice cream @ Naturals that hasn't been articulated yet. Not that I haven't been here earlier but I really had little to add until now. Remember roaming 'chatuchak market' in Bangkok once and a few shops were serving their signature coconut ice cream with unconventional toppings like sweet corn, red bean etc. It was a baby coconut ice cream and never ever in my life have had such purity in flavours. Since then have wandered aimlessly to have something like that here in NCR too, prayed to the 'Old Gods and the New' :P but then the best I could get was in Udaipur with a rose flavour one. It was only until Natural's opened in CP and everyone rushed to have tender coconut one, so did I and the time just stood still ... it was seriously such a bliss. The others like custard apple (sitaphal as they say), anjeer, mango are anyways their signature stuff. But then they might have decided to make an ice cream of the best and strongest ever coffee - Coffee Walnut and it gives every bit of punch of the caffeine you would want from your cup of coffee. I enjoy every bit of it. Well I understand the signature flavours are the one to go for the very first time .. okay may be the second too, but sometimes to give your horizon a broader view it is okay to go for the things that are unconventional .. The idea is to go and try a few other flavours and share like I did. See you in CP then :)",Rated 5.0,165,813,??
Amar Sirohi,"Rated As it is clearly evident by its enormous rating (4.9), this is THE place. Every place you eat at has one demerit or another..they don't have any. Right from its location to the ambience..from its interiors to their service..from the hygiene to the taste of their food..everything about them is picture perfect.

Purva Takkar,"Rated Finally someone brings some good experimentation to the ice cream sector! Who would have thought I would ever move ahead from my love for chocolate flavoured ice creams- but they did it. Sitafal, coconut and oh the malai! These flavours are a must try. Also their berry flavours keep you hooked. And the best part is, that it's all in 60 bucks a scoop. Guess this just gave me a reason for a late night drive just to get ice cream- even in the winters <3",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The ice creams are natural rich and creamy in taste, chunks of fruits might drop by your spoon to surprise you. If you are scared your scoop might finish, I'd suggest you go for the tub.

Nilabh Kumar,"Rated What took you so long? ---------------------------------------------- After having lived in Mumbai for while and then relocating to NCR, it goes without saying that I craved Naturals ice cream more than anything else. In fact a few years back when we headed to Goa, the sight of Naturals at Calangute beach was something that delighted us more than the beaches themselves. Having this chain in Delhi was almost a dream come true. Every flavor being offered has more character than what I have tasted in even relatively expensive ice cream brands. And your delight quotient is accentuated significantly when you have to pay just Rs. 60 per scoop. My favorite flavors are coconut, anjeer and sitafal. Of course, nothing else will disappoint either.

It felt as if was actually eating a tender coconut. Highly recommend to all ice cream lovers. Just one advice.

Rashi Tomar,Rated Here is my take for Natural Ice Cream... LOCATION - Right Opposite Kake Da Dhaba..Outer Circle..Near Minto Road...It's a full fledged Ice cream Parlor with Group Friendly Seatings. SERVICE - It's Self Service..Here it's very easy to order...They have an amazingly Sorted Menu with display of Flavours...No sizes n stuff...just ask for a double/single scoop and a Waffle/cup !! TASTE AND QUALITY - 5* . I had the TENDER COCONUT Flavour and The ANJEER..Coconut is a very mild flavour..not strong enough whereas Anjeer was really tasteful with huge pieces of Anjeer. Now I Recommend THE CUP over the@ cone coz the mild ice cream flavour gets hampered by the cone taste. They had a BERRY FLAVOUR SEASON on..for mulberry like flavours. DO TRY!! One more point -- U can get the ice creams tasted before finalizing. COST FOR TWO SINGLE SCOOPS - 140 rs Don't Think..Just TRY :),Rated 4.5,16,58,??
Aritra Chowdhury,Rated Excellent ice cream. Would recommend tender coconut flavor. The decor is good. The staff is helpful. We enjoyed it a lot. Would have been better if they made the ice cream here instead of importing from Bombay.,Rated 4.5,1,0,??

Went to the branch at connaught place and it looked like any good Ice cream parlor. Very clean and well maintained. There are numerous flavors to choose from. All the Ice creams are made with real fruits and thats how most of the upcoming Ice cream parlors operate nowadays. Tried the seasonal fruit flavors - Chickoo and sitaphal. Both the Ice cream were rich, creamy and had the right consistency. The highlight was one could taste the fruit completely in all the Ice creams and had real fruit pieces mixed in all of them.

I always felt that absence of this made my city so not done. And then CP happened. My first visit was after a couple of weeks after their opening. Why this wait? For queues to absorb themselves. But then when there was no hope of these queue formations getting over, I went in. Obviously, Taste is ultra good. You know how Italy had Gelatos and Sorbets, We have Naturals. After a third visit, I have tried almost all of them. Major Attractions are Pineapple Papaya, Litchi, Coconut, Chikoo, Sitaphal, Peach Apricot, Watermelon. And trust me, Chikoo, Litchi and Pineapple Papaya are my favorite's and a must try. Well people love Sitaphal but I somehow liked these better. Service is amazing. Prices are amazing.

I was apprehensive at first of the unrealistically high rating, and almost dismissed it as overhype.. But boy o boy I couldn't have been wronger, and the never ending lines at Natural's outlets are testimony to to its incredible quality. Every single flavour tastes exactly like it's constituents. If ice cream were to grow on trees, I can't imagine it tasting any different. Really. It's THAT close to nature. Almost all flavors delight in equal measure, though a few are thorough crowd favorites having stood the test of time. Coconut and sitaphal (custard apple) in particular come to mind. Almost can't believe I wouldn't know about this place had Benazir Anis not told me.. Not sure how I'll ever repay the favor..

Kamal Jeet,"Rated This is one of those places where you'd want to drag yourself middle of the night to stuff your mouth with some amazing, out of this world ice creams. But, unfortunately this place does'nt open beyond 12 or 12:30. Nonetheless, I love the ice creams here. You name it & I love (almost all of them). My favourite is the coconut though. I cannot feel content with just one of it. Well, for that matter, you can't just come here for a single scoop of a flavor. You are bound to try plenty of them.",Rated 4.5,21,41,??
Vanshika Seth,"Rated I have never been an ice cream fan frankly. Tried various flavours from various places and my opinion didn't seem to budge. But having tried Natural Ice Cream, there is no denying that its the best place to have ice cream from. There are numerous flavours to try, all being amazingly delicious. All The flavours taste very NATURAL and fresh. No doubt, the brand name is very appropriate. The sugar content (something I am never satisfied of in ice creams) is just fine. The place is very clean and the staff is very polite to talk to. My favorite ice creams here have been litchi, tender coconut and sitaphal. Don't hesitate to taste the flavours before buying a cup for yourself, the staff is very cooperative in that context.",Rated 5.0,5,5,??

However, just that it's a great place for ice cream lovers... I've never been able to differentiate between different brands of ice creams before but I can definitely tell this one apart. It's truly fresh, real fruits and lots of goodness .... It has many flavours some of which were very new to me like coconut, anjeer, watermelon etc... All super!! The interiors reflect their thoughts n beliefs... ... No really, literally the story of Natural Ice Cream is painted on the walls and its more interesting to read the small fonts ...... So anyway, as I started , I think I've pretty much repeated the people's verdict ..... Great place to 'chill' !!",Rated 5.0,20,32,??

Sukrity Wadhwa,"Rated Finally a breath of fresh air in terms of ice cream choices. I have had it in Mumbai long ago and I used to wonder when will it be in Delhi. And bam! few years later they are here. What a pleasant surprise! :D I have had their black grape, musk melon, tender coconut and cranberry (during the berry festival) and all of them were good. My favourite is musk melon though! For those of you who don't know, Naturals give you packed ice creams to take along for long travels as well. And, they do it amazingly. I know that because I have had people delivering me Naturals from Mumbai when it was not in Delhi. They have an ice box packing which they give you and it lasts well for a flight journey from Mumbai to Delhi. So, that's a USP for them I would say.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Tarun Talwar,"Rated Yuhooooo, being in Mumbai for almost 4 years I am a big fan of Naturals and missed it when I relocated to Delhi, but here it is.

Shikhar Maheshwari,"Rated I had heard a lot about Natural's from my cousins who stayed in Mumbai.....so when Natural's opened in Delhi, I always wanted to visit the outlet. I have visited the C. P. outlet 4-5 times since then and have found the icecreams and ambience to be great. It doesn't appear to be any coventional icecream bar and the ambience really lifts your mood :)......I have tasted their Litchi, Chickoo, Sitaphal and Roasted Almond variants. Litchi and roasted almond are simply DIVINE, while others also taste really good. Looking forward to trying their Gajar Halwa and Prasadam flavours:)",Rated 4.5,3,42,??
Mridul,Rated What sets Natural Ice Cream apart is the texture of the ice cream. The ice cream is completely different from what you'll see even in the premium offerings of Kwality or other popular brands. The ice cream is not at all lumpy but extremely smooth. The only problem is that the outlet remains crowded even at late hours. Since the outlet gets so many repeat customers that should consider adding new flavours more frequently.,Rated 4.5,6,3,??
Snigdha Garg,"Rated Amazing flavours and taste. Tender coconut is a must try. Other than that they have seasonal flavours too which are good but tender coconut tops the list. We went all the way from Gurgaon to CP to try it out, hoping to see this outlet soon in Gurgaon",Rated 4.5,30,70,??
MOVISH,"Rated ANDID CONFESSION :I'm a Natural's ice cream addict. For a decade now ,I ve pestered my friends n family in Mumbai to bring me at least a couple of flavors on every visit.I've gotten my wish every single time not because they are sweet people but because they dared not risk landing at my doorstep without my fix and be denied entry :( You can imagine my gleefull reaction when Natural's opened in Delhi.I ve visited the CP outlet scores of time and can safely claim that once you acquire the Natural's taste,you re hooked for life.The bits of real fruit in fruit based ice creams and a light ,airy texture are what set it apart from other top notch brands in the Indian market. The knowledge that what you're relishing is 100% natural n not some synthetic concoction just adds to its appeal. This time I tried the Gajar Halwa and the Prasadam flavors (launched specially for Ganesh Chaturthi).Both tasted divine:)Do try them.Also try their waffle cone sans the ice cream- that too is crisp,fresh n delicious. Everything about the outlet is nice but I do feel its ambience is a bit drab after visiting the one in Rajouri which has a burst of colors to enhance your mood,so its a 4.5 for this one.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The flavours are plentiful- chickoo, mango, sitaphal, coffee walnut,tender coconut, anjeer to name a few. Each one will leave you with a lovely aftertaste and a satisfied smile:) The ambience is great, the pricing is at Rs 60 per cup and the service is quick. Started in Mumbai under the Juhu Milk Scheme, this is the best gift from Mumbai to Delhi. The fresh, cool and light icecream is the perfect summer antidote and is more than heavenly.

Arjun Sreekumar,"Rated Great ice cream parlour with an amazing variety of flavours, especially fruit based ones. And surprisingly, quite easy on the pocket. Only drawback was they didn't have all the flavors on their ""all year"" list available at the time, its possible they ve stocked up now. But a solid entry into the relatively sparsely populated ice cream parlour business in the city, can give a good run to the established names if they continue with their innovative flavours and competitive pricing. We had the tender coconut and the jackfruit flavors both of which were pretty good. Waiting to visit again to try out more.",Rated 4.0,43,255,??

Definitely one of the best I have ever had.

I would rate this place 5/5 because of the 3 solid yet logical reasons - 1) This joint is big enough to accomodate three standing lines and side couches and round ones for people to savour their ice creams. 2) Price of any scoop of ice cream is 60 INR, the half litre tub is 300 INR and the waffle cone costs you 10INR. 3) The taste of their seasonal ice creams such as Mango, Sitaphal/Custard Apple, Litchi is amazing.

Sawan Chalise,"Rated Naturals - The Best Ice Creams Ever...... Had been earnestly wanting to visit Natural after hearing about the quality of ice creams they serve. I always wondered what exactly can a place serving ice creams offer to a world where there is an ice cream stand on every road. So here I am expressing my feelings of awe and wonder after my initial two visits to Natural. Firstly to those who have not been to Natural, 'you are missing the sheer joy of life'. Located besides Haldirams and nearest to exit number 3 of Rajeev Chowk metro station, Natural is a paradise in CP. Upon entering this place, I was wonder struck to find the ambience so huge and spacious that it easily puts many high end cafes in CP to shame. Brightly lit with quotes all around, the place has ample seating arrangement. The service is again great and they allow you to taste before you make the order. Their ice creams are delicious and feels heavenly. Definitely one of the best I have ever had. I had the 'chikoo' flavour as I had never heard of a 'chikoo' flavoured ice cream and I was pretty amazed at how the Ice Cream stuck to the authenticity of the flavours. Then you have the papaya pineapple, muskmelon and countless others. Just take a pick and you will be left impressed. Claps.. Their shakes too are amazing and cost above hundred. Ice creams cost just about 60 for a scoop in a cup and about 80 in a cone, how damn amazing is this. Ambience - 4.5/5 ( too awesome for a place that only serves ice creams) Ice Creams - 5/5 ( do I need to say something? Ya, Try It and be amazed) Value for money - 4/5 ( decent pricing for the heavenly balls of flavoured ice and creams) Service - 4.5/5 ( A nice place cannot be run without nice people) Overall - 4.5/5 Cost for two - 200 Note : Fulfil all your ice cream cravings here and believe me you will not be disappointed. Don't get your kids here or else they will make it their home. ;) Thank You C.P for having a place like Natural. Let's all scream...... Natural Ice Cream.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

A large variety of ice creams and shakes. It was a treat to find muffins also there. We ordered one sitaphal one mango one kesar pista one coffee and one anjeer ice creams. That's quite a lot!!

Sushant Chib,"Rated If you have to be successful, you have to think different, and that is what Natural ice cream has managed to do. Although there is no dearth of multinational ice cream chains in the market, Natural has done exactly what their name says - made ice creams containing real fruit. And the fruits aren't necessarily the ones you would traditionally associate with ice creams but nevertheless they go together so beautifully to make a (surprisingly) great combination. I tried the fig ice cream, strawberry, sitaphal, and coconut. They all had a refreshing flavour with real pieces of fruit, a creamy texture and it wasn't overly sweet unlike the ice creams we've gotten used to eating. A little pricey at 80 rupees a scoop but it was worth it. I suggest one should go here with an open mind and enjoy the experience!",Rated 4.5,8,12,??

The taste is creamy with chunks of real fruits added...so that we can observe an explosion of taste with authenticity.. The decor is welcoming, aura is peaceful and the place is spacious..

Shashank Kapoor,"Rated Well I can say, this is the place for ice cream lovers. Of all the ice creams I ever had in my life, no one even comes close to taste of natural's. Originated from mumbai this brand has now 3 outlets in capital, all with ratings of 4.8+ . Seriously I m not kidding. Well folks I must say maintaining this much rating is not an easy task. You have to be best, consistent and natural. :p This outlet is in outer circle near haldiram's in l block. They have nice ambience and decent sitting capacity but sometimes it gets chaotic at night on weekends. They let you taste the flavours before you put your final bet. But you will want to have all, trust me. After trying numerous options I took tender coconut and It was the right choice. It was creamy and I was feeling like I m having coconut in waffle cone. Every single bite will taste the same. I also had malai which my friend took . That too was like eating malai from over the milk. They even have ice cream packs that you can take back home and share happiness with your family. They even provide ice box if distance is the problem for you. Well give them a visit and become their fan. Ps : let us help them reach 5 ratings here.",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Meghna Joshi,"Rated The rating pretty much says it all. This is pretty much the best thing since sliced bread. I'd recommend ordering their fruit and/or nut based ice creams, because the fresh flavours of each of them is what Naturals is known for - mostly feels like you're biting into a very, very cold version of the fruit.

Pankaj Negi,"Rated It is an irony of sorts that my highest ever rating yet on zomato goes to a place that serves only ice cream and shakes. Items that I have never been a huge fan of and have always tried to avoid due to its sugar content and my lactose intolerance. The story on the wall is touching and humble. Somehow it trickles down to the product, the ambiance, the branding and even the team members of this QSR model Ice cream parlour, serving delightfully light and aptly sugared cream balls with fresh fruits and nuts which make you drool. Also something as simple as an Ice cream need not be exorbitantly priced just because you serve it in a QSR ambiance with pseudo branding. Tighten your belts all ya 'BASKIN'g in your glories coz here comes a brand from a humble south Indian background to whip your asses!! The girl scooping the delights was standing besides the cash register and was smart enough to ready my orders as I was placing them and paying for them. Hindustaan ki service industry mein yeh choti choti cheezein bhee dil ko choo jaati hain! I tasted at least six variants, ordered four and would have loved to keep having more. Each one was perfect, someone in our group ordered the chocolate ice cream in a waffle cone and was subjected to a lot of ridicule for ordering something that didn't have fresh fruits. The chocolate Ice cream though was also as good as you could get, but the show stealers were the fruity delights. The mango one was a mango shake in a ball, the chikoo had actually the granular chikoo texture, and that earthen sweet flavour which places it in an exotic fruit bracket. The height was the baby coconut, where one could actually bite on miniature baby coconut niblets (no it wasn't the dry coconut but actual baby coconut) enveloped in this creamy mildly coconuty, mildly sweetened white ball ball. OMG! Even before you take a bite of the product the branding convinces you that they don't lie, when they say they use just three produce for their Ice creams, you tend to believe them. You layer your palette with these wonders and you are just reassured. Great to see a place which says baby coconut and doesn't substitute it with a drier version. The big deal is not the ingredient (it's not even something exotic) but these days even something as natural and humble as a coconut could be such a silver lining!",Rated 4.5,46,131,??
Sonal,"Rated Visited this place a month ago. Seeing the rush inside the outlet I first thought as if the place was selling the ice creams for free. Mad rush specially after 9:30 at night. Coming to the ice creams, we ordered coconut, papaya and peach and chickoo flavoured ice creams. All the flavours were so normal. Of course the flavours are new, as in I had never had any such flavour before but the taste is not that good and unique. According to me there is just hype about this place and nothing else.",Rated 2.5,28,40,??

Neelaakshi Piplani,"Rated Prompted by the buzz created by Naturals for the offering unique and a completely different ice cream experience, me and my friend decided to visit the parlour on a weekday after my office hours. First Impression The place welcomes with a huge glass door and a pleasing neat and clean indoors. The interiors have been done with whites and greens prompting one to believe the place to be an ideal one to enjoy your scoop of ice cream. We ordered for a Choco Chip scoop and Sitaphal (proclaimed to be bestselling one). They have options give your ice cream either in a waffle cone (charges extra 10 bucks) or a cup. Wanted to have my ice cream in a cone but could as they already ran out of them by the evening. Then we sat at the clean white seats having the ice cream cups in our hand. I tried my friends Choco Chip before I could indulge in my ever so different Sitaphal which I tasted before buying. The choco chip had big chocolate chips in the ice cream which are rare to find in this-age ice creams. This one tasted like an actual choco chip cream on shelves. A must have for chocolate lovers. Right after that I dig into my first spoon of Sitaphal, the experience in crux can be said be Wow. The taste was unique, the texture was so creamy. This boring sounding, looking sitaphal was successfully transformed in an amazing experience for me courtesy Naturals . Moments later I was done with mine and wanted to try more of their flavors. But then I stooped myself with a promise to try all their flavors on show with a lot many deserving visits to this place. They also have Shakes along with Ice Creams and also have an option to get your pack of ice cream packed with a promise to last 45minutes. I'm definitely going back again..!! enticingfoodcruise.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Vishi Khandelwal - EnticingFoodCruise,"Rated Got to know about this place from one of my friend a couple of days and could not stop myself from trying their super unique flavours with a rating of 4.9 (Zomato). Easy to navigate place, it had a huge entry to an ice cream parlour (beyond my hopes). The place had a smiling guard at the door welcoming us (office tired souls). The ambient lighting was good and the place was appropriately cool (must must for delhi summers). Staff was courteous enough to cater to our demand of tasting some of the ice creams on offer. With some confusion and an urge to try something new I went for a single scoop of Tender Coconut Ice Cream and other friend of mine went for Mango. The first bite and the travel from Gurgaon to CP was all worth-it. It was yummm...beyond my expectation of a coconut ice cream. It was a proper amalgamation of sweet, flavour and the cream. I could even bite into small bits of tender coconut which took the entire experience to another level. Obviously, after this i could not stop myself from trying the Mango one. I found it good not great (nowhere near to mine tender coconut), but my mango lover friend loved each and every bite of the Mango ice cream too. An awesome experience, with an owe to try each and every flavour on offer. A must visit place.",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

I mean personally i am a chocolate lover but I went here to taste something new and different. We had their most preferred one sharifa ice cream and the watermelon and litchi. Thay tasted ok and sharifa ine was kinda bland. The flavor of the fruits cannot be felt very peculiarly until u r about to finish ur portion.

Finally a cup of sitaphal (custard apple) Ice cream was ordered. It was heavenly. The ice cream was rich in texture, and contained small pieces of actual custard apple in it.

I always start my order with 2 different scoops preferably one seasonal and round the year flavor. My favorite combo is black grapes and strawberry.

Natural are the Nirulas of Mumbai...As the name suggests they use natural ingredients and fruits to make their ice-cream. We tried mango, kala jamun, chickoo and ajneer, coffee walnut and malai something.... Mango was average not really great shakes, but jamun was exotic with every bite getting a taste of jamun (its almost end of season, so if you havent tried do the needful rightaway). Chickoo again was subtle and giving full taste and not the essence feel which other brands do, coffee almond has filter coffee taste with chunks of roasted almonds.

Udit Batra,"Rated Naturals ice cream is this chain that first began its operations in mumbai and has now opened its doors to the frozen dessert cravers in delhi. So after having heard amazing reviews from friends and family we finally decided to head to their flagship outlet in L block of outer circle of connaught place. The outlet was crowded as hell, as if they were serving ice cream for free but that didn't end our hopes we got into the queue. So after tasting 10 odd flavours we zeroed in on cheeku,mango,litchi and tender coconut. All the flavours were sheer bliss to the tastebuds and icing on the cake being they cost us just 60/- each and a waffle cone costing 10/- each. The taste is king for sure they have prooved, but I wonder why thanco's, baskin and giani's are charging so much for not so great taste when compared to naturals.

Anviti Shiromany(lady.epicurean),Rated A great healthy ice cream parlour. They have seasonal and round the year ice cream flavours. I tried the anjeer ice cream it was yummy and I could feel the anjeer in each bite. It was chunky and fresh just the right amount of sweetness and lots of anjeer to give the right flavour. I also had the mango shake it was also nice though I found it usual nothing extraordinary about it as compared to the 150 charged for it at naturals and maybe keventers has better mango shake than this.

Yaduvendra Singh,"Rated Now this is what I call a ""GOOD PLACE TO ENJOY QUALITY ICE CREAM"" In Delhi!! Natural Ice Cream has come to Delhi . A huge waiting line at 11 o clock in the night pretty does acts as it's own marketing strategy. In time for some of their summer flavours, we try out the decadent Mango, Cheeky, Tender Coconut and Litchi. Priced at INR 60 per scoop, these dollop sized goodies pack a punch. Soft creamy taste with every one of the flavours generated from its respective fruit, the Tender Coconut blows my heart away. The childhood memories of scooping out the insides of a coconut after drinking it at my grandparent's home come rushing back.

I have tried other brands earlier too like Pabrai but I am very sure that they can not compete with this brand. I tried: Tender Coconut: This is the best flavour I ever tasted. It has an awesome taste of milk with blend of coconut and tiny chunks of it too. Mango: Good. It resembles a lot to a fresh mango Litchi: Good. Same as mango. resembles a lot of the taste. The best part of this place is that whatever you try it is good. One can not avoid tasting a flavour just because of he/she does not eat that fruit. I would highly recommend to try every flavour. You can also get the ice cream packed in dry ice for some extra bucks. They give a guarantee of atleast an hour in the highest summer time so I suppose it is fine and worth it.

Just 2 counters were functional and the servers seemed confused and slow. Coming to the icecreams, we ordered for litchi and chickoo (after tasting 4-5 other flavours!) and they were pretty good. Naturals ice cream is basically good for health conscious people since you don't feel like you ate anything after you're done with them. There's no sugar, no cream. So it's unlike any other ice cream in town and makes for a perfect light, fruity dessert! The prices are reasonable. No wonder they've become so popular in Delhi!",Rated 3.5,35,318,??

Raunak Marwah,"Rated The ice cream of Juhu scheme has finally arrived in Delhi, giving more people the chance to taste their brilliant flavours. The first Naturals opened up in Connaught Place, a place where almost every new joint opens first in Delhi and has been a hit since day one. This joint in CP has a lot of space and is spread over two floors and can be made out easily from outside being present in the L block. I have been a regular to Naturals for more than a year now and honestly staying away from it for long does make one feel bad. But when the place opened up in Delhi as well, I decided to check it out while passing by on a rainy afternoon, hoping that it would be the same. Well the answer is that, yes, it's exactly the same to what it is in Juhu or Vile Parle in Mumbai. I stepped in at around 2 in the afternoon and went straight to the counter and called for my favourite, Coffee Walnut single scoop in a waffle cone. The generous scoop was well presented in a crisp waffle cone and tasted exactly the same. Smooth and rich flavour of coffee with thick pieces of walnut. Naturals in Mumbai is known for their seasonal flavours and the Coconut flavour is a sensation in Juhu. I was really happy to see the fact that they've maintained their high standards here too, which are required to survive in this industry. With the service never being an issue, I feel that this place is here for long and will make a name for itself wherever it goes.",Rated 4.0,78,182,??

Now they have three - Connaught Place, GK 2 and Rajouri Garden. Today I visited the CP outlet. It was raining since morning and we office colleagues reached there with all our enthusiasm by defeating the depressing weather. We were lucky to find the place little empty. Each one of us planned to try at least two flavours. Awesome stuff with amazing taste. First I tried one scoop of their popular jackfruit flavour. I love the taste of ripe jackfruit and enjoying that in the form an ice cream is too good. Then I bought a cone with coffee walnut flavour. It was awesome. Other colleagues of my office tried different flavours like coconut, litchi and chikoo.

The guys working there were really helpful when I told them that I was there for the first time. They let us taste almost every flavour and helped us choose their best. Apparently, their seasonal flavours are really delicious and I'm looking forward to try them. Their ice cream shakes are great too. I could try only one then and that was great.

At around INR 70 per scoop, this place is way better than BR any day. Would definitely visit again and it's very much recommended.",Rated 4.0,83,68,??
Rai Prakhar,"Rated Who doesn't know about this place!! I think if they start runnin' a chain, they would easily beat BR's(one of my personal favourites). But let's face the reality, if you have ever been to CP for lunch or dinner or any other business of yours and did not taste their stuff, your whole trip, the whole idea of that trip went in vain!!

They are just amazing and nothing extra ordinary, just the good ingredients, simple recipes....... Whenever I get options to have ice creams naturals is on Top of my wishlist.....

Aarti Lal,"Rated No doubt that their ice creams are really different from others and very good in taste too. But the only problem I face every time I visit their outlet in the night is that they are always short of their waffle cones. I mean when they know that there is a demand for their product till night, why can't they keep a fare stock of cones with them.",Rated 4.0,21,11,??
Sonal Mittal,"Rated Definitely a different place..the flavours are attracting and innovative, especially when u r bored with the regular ones at gianis, gelato vento and baskin robins. One thing which I found is that being a natural flavor, the taste is a little less, as in u don't feel d actual taste of d fruit, particularly in water melon and jamun ( which I tried). I tried chiku, being sweeter on higher side, so it was gud. Ambience is gud, place is always crowded, service is also good. Many options, and worth more than one visit to try them all !!",Rated 4.0,35,32,??
Smridhi Ahluwalia,Rated The icecream here is amazing. In summers it is a blessing in disguise. My favourite is mango.

I have tried various outlets haagen dazs, baskin ,geleto and others but the flavours it had were unique and really awesome...I along with my friends tried 4 different flavours anjeer, jakefruit, litchi and coconut. Every flavour was good, but anjeer and jakefruit were beyond expectations. Loved it. Try it guys..worth every penny..4.5 for not serving in cone and also litchi could have been better.",Rated 4.5,39,67,??
Ritika Agrawal,Rated Ambience of this place is superb..staff is suppotive... I had mango ice cream which was average not so fruity nor sweet.. But waffle cone was crispy n awesome. Another flavoured that I tried was Pineapple which was pathetic.. May be other flavours are good but mango and pineapple are not worth.,Rated 2.5,43,69,??
Anu Raja,Rated Okay ! I tasted it first in Maharashtra and never got enough of it . This is the best ice cream around . Tender coconut and Sitaphal are on top of my list . You can not afford to miss this place . Go out and and let your taste have some real desert taste of ice cream .,Rated 4.5,27,55,??

Poonam Chakraborty,"Rated Considering it was a sunday evening, I was mentally prepared about the long que. You cannot expect a store like this to be empty on a weekend. Even weekdays are same for them, try visiting them post 10:30pm you will know what I mean. And lemme tell you it was crazy, the staff was super busy. It was not crowded, it was over crowded. Both the areas were occupied, the first floor and the sitting near the counter. You will find a great mix of people here, young college going kids, couples, families all waiting for their scoop of happiness. I wanted to grab a menu asked the lady and she nodded a ""no"" and signed me towards the ""Bill board"" this is it.. At the right corner, I could see another attendent giving out the menu to the people who ask for it. I sent my friend to take a menu and finally, I had a menu in my hand. ""Tender Coconut"" my friend told me as she if already a big fan of natural. And naother friend of mine went with the basic - ""Choco almond."" I wanted to stick to the basic so I asked them if they have ""Mango"" that flavor got sold off, ""Strawberry"" - sold off. I asked them what is available the choices I had was - Malai, Jackfruit, Jamun, Sitaphal.Hm. I ended up ordering Jackfruit and Malai for myself. (I can have more than 2 scoops of ice-cream.Don't judge me. :P ) It was like an ice-cream. But wait, as they claim it it is ""Fruit based Ice-cream"". They are 100% natural. Why I say so ? While most of the Ice-cream parlours and even well know brands use fruits extract (as they claim it, and I doubt) this brand stick to the fruits. In every bite you can bite into the refined fruit chunks. The Malai flavour is pure malai. (I will hit the gym next month, no worries. Hogg in). Choco Almond - apart from the chocolate ice-cream which turned out to be in most of the brands in this ice-cream you can taste the almond (finally, I paid for the almond in my choco almond ice-cream). Tender Coconut - I am not a fan of coconut but tender coconut is different, anyone who loves coconut water out of the Green coconut would know. (try asking the nariyal paani wala bhaiya once you finish the water ""Malai hai"") That Malai is tender coconut. Naturals nailed it. It is indeed great to beat teh heat. My Favorite. Jackfruit Ice-cream.You will not like it if you don't like Indian Katthal. Bongs and south Indians have a taste of it. Katthal when ripe gets sweet, smells beautiful, very high in fiber and my friend. It is one of its kind. I am definitely having it eveytime I visit. Reminded me of my childhood days in kolkatta. Thanks for bringing up the memories. A lot many options are there. And one thing is for sure, even dieticians will not tell you to skip this one. Health in one scoop with great taste. Thumbs up from me. All these costed us some 240bucks. Thousand times better than the sugar bags I have been gulping down my throat over years. I left happy from the store. You guyz definitely need to work on the service a bit. But zero complaints as far it tastes good. Happy Eating !!! togetherwithgastronomy.blogspot.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Akshat Agarwal,"Rated I went there in a group of 18 people. 15 of us sat down in the seating area upstairs, and 3 came down to buy ice creams. After waiting about 30 minutes in queue for an ice cream that would last 3 minutes, we finally reached the counter. Placed order, got 18 cups of ice cream. But guess what. They don't have trays. So how are 3 guys supposed to carry 18 cups of icecream, not to mention remember which is which flavour, upstairs? And the staff there is as unhelpful as the delhi police. They just don't care. They sell out every evening, so it doesn't really matter to them if a customer or two walk out infuriated. 2 points for decor and snob value.",Rated 2.0,24,82,??
Swati Bhattacharya,"Rated 1st heard about it in Mumbai...but was not able to try it then due to lack of time and was really upset about it...and when it came to delhi was equally excited to go and finally have a try of all the flavors... Anjeer, chiku, choco chip, mango, muskmellon ,guava ...these are my favorites.. Thandai tasted exactly like it..but as not much fond of thandai so not that great for me.. Though I was not able to get many flavours which I wanted to try many a times..but yeah the concept of real fruits in it with right amount of sweetness does make this experience special.. Go ahead guys and beat the delhi heat with some amazing and exotic flavor ice creams..",Rated 4.0,21,60,??
Udit Malhotra,"Rated One of the best experiences for natural ice cream. All the flavours they offer are unique and tasty. You have to wait a lot at night as families take over the place.

Also tried Cola Macaroon which was also nice.",Rated 4.0,5,17,??
Rubal Singh,"Rated Natural ice cream is a must try if you are an ice cream lover. As the name suggests, the ice cream offers the ""natural"" taste of fruits.

Saloni Jain,"Rated Litchi ice cream at Natural's, Connaught Place, Delhi. If you are an ice cream buff, there is no way you wouldn't know about Natural's. This is a giant Mumbai chain, now opening outlets in Delhi- known for its yummy ice creams. True to the name, the ice cream flavors are natural to the core. This outlet in Delhi is a huge one spanning two floors and has lots of fancy decorations like mirrors and wall hangings.

Mudit Bhargava,"Rated It's okay to not like the ice cream at a 4.9 rated ice cream parlor. Hope you are not forcefully convincing yourself that it was ""just a superb and awesome experience""! The place is over rated according to me. Just because it has various unique flavors, I can't say it's a must visit 4.9 place. All right, the ambience is good (not the best, but good), the service is fine (nothing special), and the ice creams are worth a try, but I didn't really like their unusual preparations. Moreover, the cups aren't of great quality - they feel as if they were picked for their inexpensive price! Even if it's some eco friendly stuff that saves the environment - it's not good! When you are looking to provide a new experience, why not care about these details! Why not have a great courteous staff as well. I went once, and there is nothing that tempts me to try the thick ice creams again. All said, a generous 3.5 for a great new concept. Please do try at least once!",Rated 3.5,30,26,??

Finally the chain has opened in Delhi at CP. A trendy and peppy joint with clip kart on walls describing the history of the place. I have tried most of their flavours including the seasonal flavours. My personal favourites are - sitaphal, watermelon, seasonal mango, malai, litchi, chickoo and strawberry. Went to this joint with my hubby. Took tender coconut and malai flavour. Though wanted to try some fruit flavour but lot of flavours were missing or not ready or over. A rating of 4 due to this. Natural's is known for its plethora of flavours.

Their first outlet in delhi at outer circle serves the best natural flavours of ice creams. Whenevr I get to this place i just can't have one. Only if I have 3-4 scoops of different flavour would make me feel done. They serve the natural flavours of ice cream like jack fruit, chikoo,mangoo,anjeer,kala jamun nd many others. U can even taste the fruit in ice cream. I had a chance to taste malai,mango,coconut water,chikoo and lichi flavours. All of these were awesome. I cud feel the bits of lichi nd chikoo in respective flavours of ice cream. Malai tasted just like milk but had a grainy texture too and I wud recommend this to only those people who love milk.

Mehek,"Rated Natural ice cream has gained a lot of popularity in the capital city lately. The two things that attracted me the most were the interiors and the concept. With it's cool and funky new look its like no other ordinary ice cream parlour one would expect. The concept. Ice creams aren't really the healthiest of desserts but just the fact that instead of loading the sugar and dairy with synthetic flavours, the place uses natural flavours, well it gives you that tad bit of reassurance. Yes, it might not be the tastiest ice cream you have ever had but it sure is the most unique. I had the choco cream which I personally liked quite bit. The only complaint I do have, is that the texture of the ice cream is not as pleasing as I would have liked it to be. So Lastly, if its cheap, natural ice cream you crave, head on to Natural because its just the thing to beat the delhi heat with a tinge of health.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

I don't generally go beyond chocolate and black currant when it comes to sweets, but this time I decided to not be repetitive and try one of their seasonal flavors ""Litchee."" The first bite in, I realized that these amazing people put actual chunks of fruit in the ice cream?!?!?!?! My friend went for the ""coconut"" and her dad for the""jamun"" flavour and we were not disappointed. Considering that it is solely an ice cream chain, nothing sugar free is available on the menu which is a slight disappointment. Although, if you dont like the taste or flavour of milk, then this might not be the best option because that was pretty dominant in the flavoring. The quantity and pricing is spot on, and I dont think I need to pacify you about the quality. As the name suggests... its all natural. :D",Rated 3.5,10,73,??

Not only were the ice creams as awesome as everyone claims them to be, I am highly impressed with their take-away packaging. Highly, HIGHLY recommended!!! Also, the three flavors we've tried are Mango, Kesar Pista and Coconut. And coconut is literally the richest, creamiest ice cream I've ever had. To die for!

EMPTY STOMACH,"Rated My god so many positive reviews this place surly deserves it it is an Iconic place when it comes to ice creams It has some of the rarest and delicious Flavors The lichi, chocolate almond and keser pista are mine all time favourite. They offers a perfect taste and texture and that to at very lo cost as compared to other ice cream joints A scoop doesn't cost you more then 60 bucks which is quite economical as per its quality The service does get difficult at time considering the huge crowd this place pulls . You have to wait for your favorite flavor due to huge crowd and slow cashier. Ambiance of this place is so fresh and happening that it can enlighten you mood despite being crowded What else one can expect from an ice cream shop low cost ice cream , good taste , sweet ambiance ,huge variety of flavors ,quick service I recommend this place to everyone who loves Ice creams and don't want to spend much for a single scoop Ice cream 4/5 Service 3.5/5 Ambiance 4/5 Value for money 5/5",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Akash Ghavri,"Rated I was not expecting too much from the place as i came straight from Saravana Bhavan which is also well hyped here on zomata. BUT....I WAS BLOWN AWAY! I can not even begin to describe what the ice cream tasted like..it was that good! I had decided to click some pictures of the things i order to put here..but i was just too lost in the heavenly taste to think about anything else. I had the litchi scoop in the waffle cone.It had the perfect sweetness and had real pieces of litchi in it.It was very light and creamy.The taste is beyond description.You have to taste it yourself to know what the hype really is about. I also tasted kala jamun,malai and mango ice creams and every flavour just kept beating the other..Kala jamun was AWESOME..the subtle taste of jamun with the creaminess of the milk. The prices are also reasonable..60 bucks for a scoop in cup and 10 extra for a waffle cone. I would not rate it a 5.I would rate it as: GO AND GET IT NOW!",Rated 5.0,6,0,??
Ankur Jindal,"Rated Yummy yummy yummy! Only one word to describe it. Plus you don't feel guilty even if you have a tad extra.

Tender coconut, papaya pineapple, custard apple and many more as per your taste. Keep it up!",Rated 5.0,74,94,??
Kshitij Agarwal,Rated Finally natural's has inaugurated in Delhi and I bet you the flavor is just as pure as everywhere else. The seasonal flavors are low on sugar and high on the taste.

Shashank Mehra,"Rated I've never been a great fan of ice-cream, but my friends drew me inside this lovely place. This is no usual ice-cream shop. There's ample room for sitting across the large hall. We ordered a roasted almond cup, a coffee walnut waffle cone and a choco cream ice-cream shake. I decided to try a little bit of everything, though not ordering anything for myself. Not one of those ice-creams where you have to dive in and look for nuts or fruits. The ice-cream was absolutely rich, with just the perfect sweetness to it. The fruit flavour refreshes your senses, specially making it heavenly in the scorching Delhi summers. The shake was thick and delicious. Have been reading about their service in this particular outlet not being up to the mark. I, however, witnessed otherwise. There was absolutely no delay, in spite of a moderate Saturday rush. Should definitely try whenever you are in that area.",Rated 5.0,13,119,??
Akshat Goel,Rated It is too crowded all the time especially on weekends. I had to wait for almost 20 minutes to order my ice cream but it was worth the wait. They offer amazing fruit ice creams. Among the seasonal one's i tried the litchi. I must say it was the best litchi ice cream i have had. I also had the mango ice cream which was also nice. The prices are very reasonable. This place is a must try. Amd they should open mire branches in delhi as currently there are just 2 branches- one in cp and the other one in gk.,Rated 4.5,58,136,??

Utkarsh Aggarwal,"Rated Being a fan of Naturals Mumbai, I was one of those who celebrated it coming to the heart of Delhi CP (Opposite Kake da hotel). To begin with, its very spacious with benches and couches (Upstairs) to enjoy your ice cream and shakes. The Ice cream is yummy specially the black grapes & Kaju Kishmish (Though I have a feeling that its not as good as Mumbai) The waffle cones are fresh and crisp. And now that we dont have too many ice cream parlours in Delhi these days, makes it all the more fun to visit.",Rated 4.5,26,159,??

Shaleenc,Rated I know you may be surprised by my ratings given what other have rated the outlet. All I can say is then they have not tasted the flavors in Naturals Mumbai which are much more authentic and have a nice feel about the ice creams. The scoop for the price is small. Off late whenever I have visited they seem to be running out of cones and one has to do with eating out of paper cups which is disgusting. Not sure what the reason for different taste is in Delhi and Mumbai outlets but whatever it is they better fix it.,Rated 3.0,6,0,??
Asha Jose,"Rated Wow!! Fruit based goodness with an excellent eye on quality- that's the best way to describe this ice cream joint which won my heart when I first tried their tender coconut ice cream in Bangalore. And now that they've opened in the heart of the city, how could I not pay a visit. I tried their anjeer and papaya pumpkin ice cream in a waffle cone, and they were delicious beyond words!! Now that the city is almost boiling up, you have all the more reasons to hit this joint and enjoy a soul satisfying summer treat. Double wow for Natural !!",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

And there is a secret thing that you can do at naturals.... Which is to mix one scoop with two flavours.. Just be kind while talking to the server... And they would be happy to help you,Rated 4.5,49,143,??
Shubham Agrawal,"Rated Seemingly the most popular icecream parlour of Delhi, and understandably so. Was introduced to this place a few months back and since then it has become a must visit every time I find myself in CP. The parlour has plenty of sitting space and the air conditioning is always on full blast, making it the perfect place to escape form the Delhi heat and just chill for a while, literally and figuratively. talking about the ice creams, to understand what the hype is about I would recommend trying guava or chiku. They replicate the taste and feel of their respective fruits PERFECTLY , right down to the texture and aftertaste. Litchi and Kala jaamun are also pretty authentic. Watermelon and Jackfruit are avoidable. The chocolate/coffee flavors are pretty much what you would find in any other place. rating: Ambience:4.5/5 (perfectly located, plenty of comfy sitting space, clean and hygienic looking) Icecreams: 4/5 (Gotta try'em all!) service: 5/5",Rated 4.5,11,44,??

Will give 10/10 to prepration of ice creams but overall experience is bad as there is huge rush on Saturday and Sunday evening to late night.

Vratika,"Rated So natural finaly happened yesterday. It was 11 pm and the outlet was overly crowded! I was not expecting something out of the world but guess i was wrong! The ice creams are oohhhsooyummy!! We tried mango, badaam, anjeer and chikuu out of which chikuu and mango were hands down winners! Specialy the chikuu, it was insanely good and had a perfect combination of sweet n little salty flavour u get whn u eat a chikuu.. Mango flavour was equaly good. Anjeer and badaam were little disappointing but then again its obviously individual's choice. Ill make sure ill try every flavour that is available. I was told by fren's in mumbai that the custard apple flavour is incredible but that is availble only during winters as told by the staff, so will have to wait it till winters hit delhi !

So when I came across their CP outlet I wouldnt miss it for the world and I have tried it almost a dozen times by now. Recently we went to naturals after dinner at Connaught place to introduce a friend to their taste and to have a delightful dessert for self. He had not even heard about it and was quite impressed by their flavours after trying it. We reached around 9.30 pm and the place was well occupied and somehow we managed to get seats. The staff on the counter was rude and frustrated which was a mood spoiler. We ordered single scoop each of mango, tender coconut, anjeer and choco almond.

We went there in a group and ordered the following single-scoops.Kala Jamun, Jackfruit in the Seasonal range. Roasted Almond, Kesar Pista, MuskMelon, Coffee Walnut in the Round the year range. There is a reason this place is rated 4.9/5 with over 600 votes! As soon as you enter the place, there's this absolutely sweet and creamy smell that melts away all your tension. I have never had ice cream so fresh and smooth. The tastes are authentic and to the mark. It is exactly what you expect. The ice cream here quite easily meets the imagination. Above all, it's affordable. You can sit here, have the best ice cream there is, chill and go out happy with your pocket still heavy. My favorite is the Muskmelon.

Coming upto its name, the place offers various flavors very very close to the natural fruits..! My suggestion is to try the ice cream corresponding to your favorite fruit.. most people like mango (90% of the people who have tried).. but coconut is also worth a try.. Awesome place, nice ambience, self service and light on pocket. We tried:- 1. Mango Flavor (awesome) 2. Coconut (My favorite - a muusssstttt try!!)3. Kala Jamun (if you are into a bit tangy taste.. this is for you!)When people go for having an ice-cream, the main flavors which one can ask for is vanilla, tutti-fruity, chocolate (all types included).. but these flavors are something you can always have..

I have become a big fan of this place. Value for money, even when I can occasionally afford to treat myself here. Not a single disappointment. Service is excellent.

Harsimran Singh Gandhi,"Rated As the name suggests No Emulcification. The same can be seen when the ice-cream melts, it will give the taste of milk and fruits .. by fruits i mean the real fruits taste. The price is a bit expensive but worth it. Although i live close to GK but the CP one is the best outlet as it compliments with CP's ambience. The best time to land at this outlet i would suggest is in night at around 10pm. The best part of this place is that you can try all the seasonal and non-seasonal ice-creams and owners dont bother to give you a spoon to taste every flavour. My favourite ones are chickoo, jamun and papaya-pineapple the rich and original taste of ice-creams is whats makes this place a worth it.

What's Up New Delhi,"Rated Naturals opened its first Ice Cream Parlour at Mumbai in 1984 and since then it has been a sweet journey. I first tasted their ice cream in Pune, at least five years ago and fell in love with the fruity flavours they offer. Not to mention, my happiness knew no bounds when I came to know Naturals is starting operations in Delhi. Finally, my craving for all the fruity flavours was going to be satisfied after a long hiatus. They dont serve ice creams, they literally serve fruits which feel like ice-creams but taste like fruits. Get the drift? I chose my favourite black-grape ice cream to start my tryst with Naturals Delhi. But, one wasnt enough. I moved on the guava after that, but forgot to take any pictures as I delved deeper and deeper into one flavour after another. I was on a ice-cream spree. My happiness is quite evident from the picture below! It was only after I had three scoops that I came back to earth from the heavens I was floating in. They were having a Berry Festival that weekend, which made it all the more special. They dont have just the usual strawberry but cranberry, mulberry and a few others as well. It was a welcome change to get so many seasonal flavours to choose from. Here is a small peek into all the flavours! And if youre not heading to their outlet already, here are a few more items on their menu. The summer might still be far, but the time is always right for some ice-cream, right? The Naturals Wall of Fame was a major attraction with everyone inside this huge Ice Cream Parlour. Media Mentions and loads of accolades from as long as they could remember!",Rated 4.5,4,6,??
Harish Chawla,Rated After a good satiating dinner in one of the good restaurants in CP all you look forward is a delightful dessert to complete your meal. Its always a good idea to skip the dessert in the restaurant and have it somewhere else. So that's how we ended up at Natural Ice Creams .. Absolutely yum... No match to other Ice Creams. Highly recommended from my end. Loved the Water Melon flavor.,Rated 4.5,34,83,??
Sakshi Bindal,"Rated Got a flavor of this place first in 2012 on my visit to Mumbai. Famous for its fruit ice creams, one can see long queues outside it's Marine Drive outlet. People die to have ice cream from this dessert parlor. And why not, after all they use natural ingredients like fruits, dry fruits, chocolates, milk and sugar rather than going for preservatives and artificial colors. Was glad to know about opening of its outlets in Delhi and made sure to visit the one in Connaught Place as soon as possible. This outlet is bigger and more spacious than the ones in Mumbai. I have stayed for a short while in Mumbai so can easily compare the outlets in Delhi and Mumbai. The decor is very fruity and reminds of pulpy desserts. One can expect some delays in their service which is not new to me. Natural parlors are known for their lax attitude. However, the ice creams are delectable and no one can resist them. One can see seasonal and round the year ice cream options on menu. Tried sitaphal, mango, tender coconut, pineapple, anjeer, coffee walnut, chocolate flavors. My personal favorites are sitaphal and tender coconut that are rich and mushy in taste. This place is a must visit for its finger licking and flavorsome ice creams minus any stabilizers, one can ignore the service though and enjoy the natural desserts of Naturals.",Rated 4.5,7,22,??

Karan Kumar (@karansayz )( Www.facebook.com/karansayz)(Famed Karanz Review)( Delhi/NCR Top Reviewer),"Rated Background When you open a place without the basic checks in place what do you get. I first had these in Pune during B school days . Ambeince They have limited manpower and hence waiting becomes an irritant . Mostly, the counters dont work to full capacity and hence lines are formed. At times , people may move out as well . The decor inside is good enough and neat. Food & pricing The Sitaphal and cheekoo ones are my picks . The watermelon and mango tastes are also a good try . Try the coffee walnut as well . USP You may spot some monkeys as well , real ones. It has a simple ambience with a old world charm . The outdoor sitting is good though may not be clean.

Nikhil Chawla,Rated A the rate they are selling this is the best ice cream money can buy in Delhi .There are few things which are unprofessional from them .

Even Hagan Daaz @Select City Walk Saket never sees lines that are so long. So my expectations grew. The ice cream is delicious, the fresh fruit flavours are the best like, tender coconut, kala jamun, papaya apricot, melon, pineapple, mango. The ice cream is made without preservatives and that is a major plus. Besides the decor & sitting make the waiting bearable. A definite must visit.",Rated 3.5,44,172,??

Himanshu Kashyap,"Rated It came to me as a big shock when I realised that Naturals has been around in Mumbai since a long time and it is only now that Delhi people got to taste it. It was simply unfair to deprive rest of the India from the greatness this place has to offer. Undoubtedly, Naturals serve one of the best ice creams that I have ever had. It definitely stands as India's contribution to world's taste buds. With great ice cream flavors and an unmatched taste, Naturals should definitely look forward to expanding their network across the country soon. It doesn't come as a surprise that very often people have to wait in long queues just to get this ice cream. It is definitely worth it. Talking about the place in Connaught Place, it is very well accommodating considering it to be just an ice cream parlor. The place has great ambiance and great and quick service. Moreover it is very affordable. I can only request the guys at Naturals to start home delivery soon. I am definitely going to visit that place often now that I know about it. Do not forget to try out Tender Coconut Ice cream next time when you get there.

But whenever i think about Ice Cream Parlours, I remind Mangalore's Ideal Ice Cream Parlours. Their style is different and you can't Ice Creams like them anywhere. So i had that taste in mind and was expecting something similar from Naturals also. But Naturals has forced me stop comparing with Ideal. Naturals has its own taste. Real and Natural, no artificial flavors added as told to me by their service associate. I had gone to this outlet a week before, and tried their Hot selling 1) Tender Coconut 2) Cheeku 3) Roasted Almond 4) Pineapple + Papaya 5) Watermelon among all of them - Tender Coconut and Cheeku being the Most favourite of mine also.

Varun Khattar,"Rated Connaught place, considered the heart of Delhi needed a good ice cream parlour for so long & i am so glad 'Natural Ice creams' filled this void. I have always been a fan of their fresh & unique flavours since i keep visiting Mumbai often & i always wished them to open up a joint in Delhi & it eventually came true :D They have seasonal fruit flavours & they all are distinct and refreshingly natural. Be it their Litchi, Alphonso Mango, Guava, Anjeer, Sitafal or Coffee Almond, it's hard to choose one. So i always go for twin fruit flavoured double scoop waffle cone :p Anyways, everyone has his/her own preference of fruits,so i won't suggest a particular one. But it's the 'Tender Coconut' which i consider as their flagship flavour. it's perfectly crafted & tastes like the actual Malai that we get after drinking the coconut water. Too good.

Link - howsthatdish.com/ Thanks! Naturals is known for its range of seasonal and around the year fruit flavours. From common flavours like mango and strawberry to unconventional ones including figs and papaya, youll find it all. I chose to go for the tender coconut. I am not a fan of vanilla based white ice-cream, but this wasnt anything like other white ice-creams. The first bite of the single scoop that I had ordered made me fall in love with it. It was a perfect blend of subtle but prominent coconut flavour with mildly sweet ice-cream. There were little coconut shavings scattered into the cream that exactly felt like having actual coconut, just that this was smooth and creamy. Definitely worth a try !!!",Rated 4.5,13,76,??

Sundeep And Bedabrata,"Rated Our childhood associates ice cream carts as harbingers of summer. While the ice cream vendors play a very important role in the scheme of things, ice cream parlors are an alternative for people who prefer a caf atmosphere. To this end, Naturals is an ice cream chain from Mumbai that has now forayed in the Delhi markets. At the onset of summer, we found their CP outlet bustling with customers. This chain claims that they use all natural ingredients milk, sugar and fruits. Slightly skeptical, we order the Tender Coconut and Kala Jamun. One spoon and we realize that these are not tall claims. The ice creams are moderate on sweetness and high on the fruit quotient, fruit chunks / pulp coming in the mouth with every spoon. The consistency is smooth and it does not seem as if any preservative has gone into this. We then order roasted almond and anjeer and another round of tender coconut and watermelon and coffee walnut to end it with malai. And that is just for the two of us. :-) The menu is split into ""seasonal fruits"" and ""round the year"" varieties. In our opinion the Tender Coconut is the star this summer. However, their regular flavors Anjeer or Coffee Walnut or Roasted Almond are different from the fare that we otherwise get.

Amol Benny,"Rated If you are at CP and dying for some good icecreams , do some justice and go to ' Natural Ice Cream '. Located in the outer circle L-BLOCK, this place has the best ice creams. They have 2 floors so you will surely get a seat, hope so. The flavors are amazing with ice creams feeling really refreshing. The cost is average. For this quality you won't mind paying the amount asked for. Do visit.",Rated 5.0,6,244,??
Sarthak Pandey,"Rated The freshness of the ice cream, the decent white interiors, the quotes on originality and the story of the owner of the place, all of it makes naturals special.

Nilesh Dhanda,"Rated Visited this place last night along with my brother with a notion to offer him a unique ice-cream experience. And Believe me the place stood up to my expectations. Located at the central location of Delhi, the store offers a spacious experience with unique ice-cream flavors. I ate anjeer flavored ice cream and the experience can be best described by the Silk ads by Cadbury.",Rated 4.5,1,47,??

Sushriit Chatterjee,"Rated As the name suggests it would leave you with just the natural flavours which would fill in your soul. Yes, that's Natural. It's located in the outer circle in Connaught Place-L8 and one in Greater Kailash-2 in Delhi. We went to CP for the Natural delight. There's a slight nip in the air and it's to stay. Delhi would be having and exciting summer with its scoops and scoops of ice cream: tender coconut, watermelon, figs, milk chocolate chip, caramel and more. The store in Connaught Place is nice and their is freshness in the ambience. We wanted to have Papaya Pineapple, however it was sold out so ended up having PSG (Pineapple Strawberry Guava) and it was so good. The other flavour that we tried was tender coconut. I actually thought that we were having coconut. We took both the ice creams in cones, though you can choose between a cup and cone. Naturals as the name says, they only use fruits , dry fruits, chocolates, milk and sugar with no preservatives or stabilizers. They also provide take away, yes that's unusual but they do. The rate list ofcourse will not burn a hole in your pocket. With unconventional and unique flavours like tender coconut and sitaphal (custard apple), Natural is a delight for ice cream lovers. This place is a must visit any time and every time you crave to have Natural ice cream.",Rated 4.5,22,1493,??

Chashmish Reviews,"Rated Okay! The most lip smacking Ice cream brand from Mumbai finally opened in New Delhi. And where? In the heart of the Capital city, Connaught Place. Located at the outer circle, this outlet is quite spacious for an ice cream parlor. The menu has been moderately set up to suit the Indian pockets. Their natural taste backing seems to be doing really good for the brand. I could also read about its origins on the walls inside which is really cool. The varieties they avail are incomparable. From Sitaphal to Coconut, from roasted almonds to malai, the menu just keeps it balanced and well organized for each taste bud. My favorites are Tender Coconut, Coffee Walnut and Roasted Almonds. Their subtle bursts of taste just gives you the needed kick in Delhis heat. Pure bliss from the first bite till the end. After trying Natural, I fil at liking any other ice cream available around. Highly highly highly recommended to all the ice cream lovers! Guess what, its open till midnight ;) Enjoy! chashmishreviews.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Lip smacking.. Yummily flavours..,Rated 5.0,51,50,??
Karan!!!,"Rated After a successful opening day they are going strong & will not look back. The people will be satisfied every single time when they visit this parlour. The place is enormous & their taste is profound with a reasonable pricetag on their products. I've always felt that the frozen sector of the food industry has been lagging behind it's compatriots. While the fast food industry is blooming as are the other cuisines, people don't really know what a great ice cream is. Most Indians curb their appetite by having kwality walls or any other brand & I'm not taking anything away from them but outlets like these need to be more affluent in the Indian industry. People have responded extremely well to this parlour & with their natural taste backing them they are set for a bright future. That being said I really think that they should add a lot of other flavours & nothing can stop them from becoming a 5-star parlour.",Rated 4.0,80,82,??

Rishabh Verma,"Rated Mumbai's frozen awesomeness comes to Delhi. Situated in the Outer Circle, this is a pretty open space to sit and rejoice in, compared to their small-scale shop in Powai where I was introduced to this delight. Great thing is that it's open till midnight, and you can read about it's origins on the walls inside. I love the varieties they stock, and pretty sure I've had all the fruit flavors between the two cities. My favorites are Sitaphal and Tender Coconut, I simply adore their subtle bursts of taste.

Karan Jaidka,"Rated The famous Bombay Naturals' icecream made its grand entry to Delhi, and it was just a matter of time before I visited the outlet to lose myself in its ultimate bliss, and it more than met my expectations! Decently sized store located on the Outer Circle. The store's ambience is quite good with lost of space to move around, but just two cash counters, which do get crowded at times! The Naturals' story and how the saga began are well illustrated on the walls, which makes for a good read! The seating arrangement is different but quite appreciable! Coming to the icecreams.. there are certain flavours which are must-haves, no matter what! And tender coconut tops this list! Mindblowingly brilliant!! No comparison whatsoever! Pure bliss from the first bite to the last, making you cringe for more at the end! The coconut pulp pieces in each bite are fantastic! Other great flavours I tried were anjeer and mango, which were amazing as well! Seasonal flavours I'm really looking forward to are lychee and custardapple!

No waffle and even though they have a berry festival board right infront of the billing counter but there was not a single berry flavored icecream. This is unlike the Naturals at Mumbai .

Reading 4.9 rating we went with heightened expectations but were disappointed. Ice creams were average, no chunks of fruit or anything. Gelatos are any day superior. The only thing going for the place was the peppy seating and decor and the very cheap prices. Still I would have expected a max 4 rating.

Mayank Gandhi,"Rated Located in the outer circle just opposite to Pabrai,s is this ice cream parlor. The place is quite big in size but most of the area is disengaged. This joint has flavor of everyone's choice. Each flavor has its own twist and taste is really rich. The bad thing was that they were short on cones the day I'd been to this place.

Coconut tender, chikoo,thandai are the flavours I tasted and relished ! It has to be one of the most brilliant food idea ever! The ice creams don't leave a funny aftertaste in your mouth nor do you crave water after gorging down one.

Ruchi Kaur,"Rated Something about the goodness of healthy food makes you feel warm inside, it's even better when it's an ice cream spreading that warmth. Naturals is an absolute must if you are health conscious or if you are a fruit lover or if like me your mother's fed you dollops of fruit infused ice creams when you were a kid, you'd love the place. You get what you're promised- milk, fruits and sugar. The double floor outlet is huge and white, almost like an apple store with mirror-lined walls on one side, while the other side it has an info-graphic about the chain. The staff is warm, you get to taste multiple flavours and you'd keep coming back for more. A feel good treat for the entire family.

Priya Saxena,"Rated There can be nothing wrong about this ice cream joint, then be it in Mumbai or Pune or Delhi. Every flavor can engage you in a sumptuous delight.

Oendrila Mandal,Rated This is a pretty big place in the outer circle of CP. They have really really good ice creams. The best part about them is that they give you such a generous amount to 'taste' that your entire family can taste a little bit to see if they like it. One scoop is for 55 bucks (inclusive of all taxes) which is pretty reasonable for the quality of their ice cream. they have it in all fruit flavors. We tried Mango and Jackfruit (both 10/10) The scoop looks small but it's a lot once you try to finish it. Great experience. Do try!,Rated 4.5,15,19,??

So obviously I went to the CP outlet with a lot of expectations and boy was I disappointed! Firstly none of the seasonal ice creams were available. So we ordered Tender Coconut, Watermelon and Anjeer. All of them were very average and did not do justice to their bombay counterpart. Gianis is any day better.

Service: The servers are very quick in giving you what you've been patiently waiting for. The staff helps you pick your flavour & taste them. Food: The ice cream justmeltttts! There are no icy chunks, just the creaminess that lingers in your mouth and keeps you wanting more. It is milk + fruit + sugar = yumminess. Value for money? Yes. Will I go again? A BIG YES!

Nishank Gulati,"Rated The much hyped brand of ice creams from Mumbai finally made it's way to Delhi. As the name suggests, all of its products are made of natural flavours from fruits and dry fruits. So it becomes a 'must' in your bucket list. I have been to the Mumbai and Shirdi outlets aswell and have had a really good experience. However, I cannot say the same about the CP outlet. The staff is rude and non-responsive. I asked one of the staff members to make me taste a flavour. He didn't respond at first and later said please ask at the next counter. When i went to the other counter, it didn't have that flavour. So i had to ask the other member from the staff to make me try it. She asked me the name, but since i didn't know i had to show it to her. She was rather lazy, saw it from far off and mentioned the name. Leaving no option for me to taste. Also while ordering, they said they didn't have a cone. Was highly disappointed with the service. The management must look into the matter.

Aman Gupta,"Rated ""Naturals"" A jaunt to CP is a totally waste without trying out this ice cream place specially in summers. Very true to its name, it savors really natural. The coconut, anjeer, strawberry, custard Apple, mango, chikoo, almonds almost all the flavors are highly recommended. Naturals Ice Cream is a Mumbai based ice cream chain. Located near to Haldiram's, CP this ice cream parlor is abuzz with ice cream lovers throughout the day. The prices are not too high but the servings are very small. So you won't be pleased by having just one cup or a cone because of their flavorful, creamy and simply delicious taste which is a pretty good strategy because you can actually give a try to more than a one flavor. Since season of mango is approaching, I'd highly recommend that flavor. Well their ice creams are made from full cream milk thats the secret of creamy taste and in every ice cream you will get small pieces of fruits. You can order a scoop or take away with an ice cream tub of 500 gm.Tender coconut, Mango, sitaphal and roasted almonds are my favorite ones.

Jackfruit: C'mon this tastes gud as well the one, u'll think twice before ordering this but trust me it is gud, just go for it- u dont get this option of flavour at lot of places. And all this sweetness in just 60-70 rupees. this icecream is worth more than every penny.The only reason i am not rating it 5 is the lack of availability of icecreams.

If you have heard of how it has never disappointed anybody back in Mumbai, you will pretty much realise that it doesn't disappoint here too. With two outlets that have opened recently, one in Connaught Place and the other in Greater Kailash, I happened to visit the one in CP, near Haldirams, What caught my eye first was the fascinating ambience, with a lot of color and posters, and also the fact that it is extremely spacious. The berry festival is on, but if you wish to stick to the basics then you can definitely depend on the mango, anjeer and the choco almond flavors. You tend to compare the quality a little with the Mumbai one, and it won't be wrong to say that the original Naturals in Mumbai is slightly better.

Ameya Bothara,Rated Their berry festival is going on so try out some cool flavors. I tried the cranberry with a cone but realized that the cone was interfering with the flavor of the ice cream. Will be better if one has it in a cup to taste the delicacy without mixing flavors up. The thandai flavor was a little too strong but nonetheless true to the Naturals' originality. My other favourite now is the malai after the seasonal sitaphal (but these guys didn't have sitaphal for a long time). Definitely recreating the Pune n Mumbai magic of Naturals.,Rated 4.5,84,316,??

Althought the staff was courtious enough & apologistic for the same when I raise the issue, and yes replaced my ice cream with a fresh serving, but the fact remains that it's a Darn serious issue that two plastic pieces could have been a serious health hazard if swallowed. *yes I could not take a picture as the staff disposed of the ice cream along with the plastic pieces.",Rated 1.5,13,44,??

Deepti Kumra,Rated From Bombay to Delhi.. The fame of Naturals icecream has surely travelled.. After being a huge hit in bombay.. Its now in delhi with 2 branches.. Naturals has a huge branch in cp with 2 floors and a nice seating arrangement. They also have a small enclosure where groups of above 6 can sit and relax. The ambiance was nice and the interiors were very different. When I was looking at the ice cream flavours they offer.. I was amused by some really different ones but wanted to have a safe option for the first try. Mango icecream- 4.5/5 Yes it was amazing! It was really soft and the flavour of mango was perfect Kaju kishmish icecream- 3/5 Although my friend loved it. I somehow felt that it tasted like frozen kheer so it was a No for me. Strawberry icecream- 4.5/5 Yes this was truly the best one! The small pieces of strawberry made it really amazing! The pricing is average. Not too much not too low.

Nishant Dua,Rated I recently went Pune and while coming back I wanted to have this ice cream but Damn!! I was late for my flight so had to leave it . Few days back I was just passing by CP and I saw this parlour . I parked my car as soon as I saw and went in . I had heard a lot about their Apple custard ice cream and hence tried that . It was delicious . It wasn't very sweet and was totally made of natural products as the name suggests . The next one that I tried was seasonal mango that was alphanso and was again awesome . I really liked the texture of the ice cream . The milk was still thick even after melting a bit and not like mother dairy's wchich flows off just like water . One more thing that I liked about it is that it can easily be kept for half hour or more without refrigeration. In the month of December I was coming from CP TO DU and the ice cream still remained hard enough to be consumed on the spot without cooling it for some more time . I surely recommend this place specially their Apple custard ( though sounds absurd ) and tender coconut which are their specialities . Surely they won't disappoint you . Will visit this place asap after my exams ?,Rated 4.5,20,111,??
Shaurya Ganguly,"Rated I'm glad Delhi will get to experience good icecream instead of mediocrity in the name of giani ice cream.

My all time fav flavours are mango and tender coconut. The ice cream has great flavour and actually stands true to its brand name.

The dcor is extremely vibrant and inviting. The staff was good with us too.

Three small scoops costed Rs. 160 inclusive of taxes. I would love to come back here to try the very famous sharifa, which I have heard is the best flavor.

And exactly 9 months after persuading them over e-mail to give me a franchisee (Yeah, my love for it was so intense that I wanted to be a part of the team), they dropped me an email that they were opening up in GK! And I was dancing to the news. However, a GK visit wasn't possible then and my encounter with Naturals only took place on 26th of January, when they made me wait for half an hour before they opened up the doors of heaven for me! Seetaphal was my first preference but I was disappointed when the Lady at the counter told me, Seetaphal wasn't available due to an off season. They were running the berries festival and had a limited run for cranberries, blueberries and some other berries ice creams. Tried the blueberries and was fully satisfied. But the highlight of the day was cheeku and strawberry. Cheeku being a thick flavoured fruit has a very strong taste and any injustice to the composition can either break the taste or make it amazing. Naturals was fully able to deliver to my already experienced expectations and both the Flavours I had were pretty great.

Shrey Kumar Singh,"Rated Freshness !!! Yes that's how I describe Naturals in one simple word.... Background: Post many copies the original Naturals from Mumbai (Juhu) comes to Delhi and what better place than Connaught Place for the outlet.... Pretty large place for an ice cream parlor but well made... The interiors r made in a way that describes its history and variety....And yes gladly my 50th Zomato review is of this place... Taste: Its certainly a breath of fresh air.... Undoubtedly the best ice cream you can have....you try expensive ones like gelatos or cocoberry OR u try super expensive ones like Hagen Dass ...but I would still say the taste, freshness n satisfaction of an ice cream that Naturals will give is unparalleled....u like it or not but the Must have flavor is MANGO.... Others like Sitafal, roasted almonds, black grape, etc r amazing too.... Okay one disclaimer I m not a fan of Chocolate flavor n I don't eat it, so can't comment on tht... But having said that would still suggest don't go for chocolate since it's all abt the fruit ice cream here... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Lovy Bhatia,"Rated A great dinner always ends with an ice-cream . To make a boring regular day not so boring , we add ice-cream to it . Ice-cream has always been a special part of our lives since childhood. Even if u spending thousands on dinner , if someone buys you anice-cream , the excitement is different. Coming to naturals it is one of the best flavoured and well blended ice-cream in town. Its like eating the original fruit along with cream. Very well balanced sugar content. Sitafal , chikoo and papaya-pineapple are must try.Scoops are affordable and worth every penny. Coming to the layout , I have been to natural's in Mumbai and Bangalore but this branch in CP looks completely different , its huge and pretty. You can sit there and relish your scoop rather than just taking it away.",Rated 4.5,30,229,??
Prashant Singh,"Rated A long wait was over finally. Natural ice cream has always been my favourite in pune and Mumbai. Unfortunately the Delhi outlet could not reach expectations. They may have reworked the recipes in Mumbai and pune as well, can't say I tried coconut, seetafal (sharifa for delhi people ) , alphonso, watermelon and roast almond. I was heart broken after tasting roast almond. It used to have a much stronger flavour earlier. Alphonso, watermelon and seetafal were good. Coconut was the winner for me. The ice creams were excellent in texture as well. One should definitely give it a try.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Chhavi Arora,Rated I was a regular at naturals in Mumbai and was really thrilled to hear that's its opening in Delhi. Tried out last week in CP I must say that not even a bit disappointed.

Chitresh Gupta,"Rated I loved the ambiance and the way it has been designed. Interesting posters and seating choices which I think is a huge plus of the parlour. The Ice creams on the other hand were not that big of a strong suit. We had two ice creams, Choco Bite and Choco Almond and I liked the price to taste ratio of it. Obviously since I've had at Natural's Mumbai, I could feel it lacked behind somewhere in taste. Not much but about 20-30% which made the experience a bit more than good but not great.

We were delighted with the mango and strawberry ice creams that we ordered. It tasted like you are actually eating the fruit. The place is very 'freshly' done - with natural ingredients (fresh fruits) being the highlight.

I was taken to this place by my junior colleagues and well I owe them a Biggg Thanks for showing me to an awesome ice-cream parlor :) The ambience of this place is very Happy, just exactly how an ice cream parlor should be as ice creams make you happy :) All their flavours are yummilicous !!! The ones that took my liking are Malai , just as soft and fresh like the tender malai of freshly boiled milk.... Yummmm!!! ( recommended if you are going for two flavours, choose this as a base flavour, as it will enhance the taste of any other flavour). Next my vote goes to Roasted Almonds... The crunchiness of almonds and rich flavour of the cream will melt your heart away! :) Coconut malai, pineapplen'pappaya and anjeer are some other interesting flavours, quite new and yummmmyyyy to taste :) If you are looking to make someone happy or even if you wanna experience some pure unadulterated happiness guess we have a new ice cream parlor in town to take our stress away :) :P Can't wait for my next and next and next ....

We had Tender Coconut and Mango flavors, and would recommend both. The tender coconut is their signature flavor and you must try it. And as I learned today, there are only three ingredients of their ice creams - fruits, milk and sugar. So it's as natural as it can be. Must, must visit!",Rated 4.5,60,139,??

A welcome break from the usual, this is a must visit for ice cream lovers! The second time I went around, I had coconut and coffee almond.

Prabhakar Singh,"Rated It should be illegal to be this good. This was my first time to a Naturals. And Holy Mathematical Equation was it awesome. Went with a few friends so got to try more than a flavours few. Papaya, Black currant and Cheeku. Did any one know Papaya ice cream existed? Because I sure didn't. I hate Papaya. From the bottom of my non-existent soul. But since I'm prone to experimentation I thought to give it a try. And boy, it was delicious. Never expected that. Who knew papaya could be tasty (for me)? Are there drugs in it? Coz thats the only explanation I can come up with for wanting to eat more. The only problem was that there weren't the whole list a flavours available as described on the menu. So no watermelon flavour for me I guess. and a few others whose names elude me at the moment. I think I will just have to make do with what could have been. Cant believe I was in Mumbai for a year and never had Naturals. I should metaphorically kill myself.",Rated 4.0,42,159,??

Trust me, Simplicity is the way to go and naturals does a very good job at it. I mean,everything was clear and whatsoever no confusion over ice creams or any of that sort. Now my friend,she only believes that ice cream means chocolate so she ordered a chocobite.I on the other hand was dieing to try the very popular,yes Sharifa(Sitaphal) flavour. Well everything doesn't go perfect ever :P Sharifa is seasonal and wasn't available.Come again when? July.Tooo far :( Any way so I had tried the cranberry and blueberry. To my surprise the cranberry was so sweet that after that the blueberry I tasted,I couldn't get any flavour. Anyway finally I decided to give my friend some company and we both had chocobite.

Shantnu Jain,"Rated Delhi-ites had been waiting for this one since a long time. This unique ice cream parlour chain has always been in the go-to list of anyone travelling to mumbai. The Delhi joints have met all expectations. You get the same authentic natural fruit flavours that you get in Mumbai. The ice creams are like frozen fruits and no other joint has been able to replicate its taste. My favourite flavours: sharifa, cheekoo, anjeer, guava. They opened the joints in winters and you can still see a queue of people on these outlets at almost all times. God knows what will happen in summers.",Rated 5.0,37,84,??
Nitika Kumar,"Rated The most amazing mango ice cream ever.!! And this means a lot coming from someone whose first choice in ice creams is usuaally coffee or chocolate. I have been there twice so far and already its on my must visit list any and every time i am in CP.! Have tried mango, choco creme, coffee walnut, tender coconut.! All flavours impeccable.! But the mango gets the crown, hands down. Their ice creams deliver exactly what their name promises: a natural flavour thats surely leave you hanging in for more. The texture and sweetness of their ice creams is perfect. You will know from the first bite that you are actually biting into actual fruit and not some added flavoured sugar cream.! One of the best things about the joint, it is absolutely eash on your pocket. Wont pinch at all. Specially when you have other icecream parlors draining you of more than 100/150 bucks for one scoop, their icecreams are priced only at Rs. 55 per scoop and taste hell lot better. The ambience of this store is fun too, though you cant want to sit here too long. Not that the staff will object, they are way too humble and warm, but the feel of the place is to be enjoyed while you delve into your creams. Must visit if you've got a sweet tooth and you are at CP.!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Akshay Ahuja,"Rated The very first thing that strikes you at this place is the whole story board about the Naturals Ice Cream's genesis and journey. Presented in the infograph format, it is both attractive and quite informative about the various innovations that brand has done over the time. Before here, I have experienced Naturals Ice Cream at Pune and Indore, but the store here is more spunky than those. The outlet was spacious enough but could get crowded on weekends. I would have liked the serving platform to be a bit lengthier or having an extra hand or two for serving the customers. In the current format one has to jostle a bit and wait to get their orders or try the flavor before buying. Pricing was fair and the overall experience quite nice.",Rated 4.5,24,277,??

The ice cream is very well priced and the staff was all smiles . Tried their tender coconut and musk melon. Both were fantabulous. Some people wrote in their reviews that the sugar tastes less but I thought the sugar content was absolutely perfect , not too much and not too less . The best part was that they have real fruits inside like mine had the tender coconut and the musk melon had the same as the name suggested and the taste of the ice cream was spot on what the name suggest. I've heard that their sitaphal is the best thus one can try that. To end it I would like to mention that the waffle cone was the best I've ever had . Dig in!",Rated 5.0,144,614,??

They are so addictive that it's impossible to stop at 1 scoop, difficult at the 2nd and still not easy at the 3rd! It's incredible how an icecream can taste so much like the actual fruit! Tender coconut is heaven, so is Sitafal... try these before any other. Other flavors are also great though. I had my first ever scoop 4 months back (Sept 14) in Goa and were disappointed to know that they don't have an outlet in Delhi. After coming back started looking for places nearest to Delhi that have an outlet. We would've planned a trip to Jaipur (being the closest outlet) and were few of the happiest people to have them open an outlet in Delhi! Oh BTW, the CP outlet is quite big and luxurious as compared to other outlets in India. You can sit back and relax with your friends and enjoy the icecreams till you have a brain freeze!",Rated 5.0,19,19,??
Kamal Vijhani,"Rated My life's sweetheart is finally here, We (Natural & I) have an old connect from Maharashtra (Pune) ever since the year 2008 and it has a lot of sweet memories associated with it. Natural Ice Cream is India's first and the oldest natural flavored ice cream parlor chain. Friends of mine spoilt me by bringing my favorite flavors to Delhi in the Dry Ice Boxes by Flights or Trains- So would I practice while returning home from various parts of Maharashtra to share the joy of sweetness with friends of mine. Hands down on its hot selling flavors, here we go... Sitaphal/Shareefa (Custard Apple), Jackfruit, Tender Coconut n Cheeku and these hapoen to be sll my favorites. Rest Natural keep surprising its patrons with the seasonal flavors like grapes, mango, alphanso mango and various berries through out the year. Watermelon, Papaya, Anjeer (Fig) are also something I would vouch for. I never tried the shakes but they would be equally fine. So, one thing to be assured about Natural is that the ice cream chain does not use any synthetic or artificial ingredient at all, the sweetness of all its ice creams is relatively moderate while most of the fruits are hand picked from their farms and there goes hell lot of skilled-manual labour (till date) to process flavors like tender coconut & jackfruit to ensure their real essence and texture. Natural is here with its grand entry and fresh look with two stores in Delhi; the maiden store in Greater Kailash & the second one in Cannaught Place after much of wait; that ends the imports of my favorite ice creams from Maharashtra as its even closer to my heart now.",Rated 4.5,15,66,??

Mohit Agarwal,"Rated This place is situated right opposite the legendary kake and bhape da hotel, basking right next to Haldiram. With so many biggies around, it certainly has to live up to expectation of foodies like us :) Ambiance is simple and appealing. Spacious white interior complement it with the class that it deserves. Now, coming to ice cream, we tried the Sitafal (Sharifa), Roasted almond and Tender Coconut with a mind full of apprehensions and must say that the ice cream did not look that unique but boy o boy were we in for a surprise, beginning with the bill, each was only 55 Rs. First bite and we all fell in love, eyes closed moaning in pleasure and just trying to savour that irresistible and absolutely unique flavour. I mean, i for one, could never have imagined a Sharifa falvoured ice cream. The intention to ""just try it"" turned into an order for 6 ice creams :D and the fact that these are natural ice creams is an extra incentive of substantial magnitude. Must visit for everyone be it winter or summers. DO NOT MISS SHARIFA FLAVOUR. Enjoy, the change in way we eat ice creams. By the way, gave it 4 rating because some flavours were not available.",Rated 4.0,49,26,??

Karan FoodFanatic,"Rated What would be better than having ice cream on a cold winter day ? And what if it is natural ice cream ? Bliss This would be my first experience of having natural ice cream and definitely not the last. Located in one of the most happening parts of delhi, cp,natural was and is still able to attract a lot of crowd towards it. The ambiance is crisp and clean and would probably be one the most well set ice cream parlour that ive been to. The staff was very cordial and helped me select the flavour of my choice. I tried their staphal ice cream which seems to be one of their most famous ice creams. Superbly creamy and melodious undertones of the fruit were blissful. Chocolate chip. Oh boy. Huge chocolate chips in creamy ice cream and crunchy waffle cone. nirvana The prices set are great too, 55 for any flavour of scoop that you want and 10 buks for the waffle cone. Had this outlet been near by my place, i would have definitely got a few of em packed. A MUST try. Cheers karanfoodfanatic.wordpress.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Vikas Yadav,"Rated One doesn't really need to review the flavours and quality of product at Natural. 2400 scoops flying to Delhi from Mumbai everyday is sufficient a certificate of love that we have had for Naturals. Nothing much to say about the ice cream. Sitaphal (Sarifa) happens to be my favourite with a close coconut at second and roasted almond at third. I am still waiting for the sakes through. I have been enjoying naturals for almost 8 years now. Each time i travelled to Mumbai for work or my studies, I would make it a point to bring back 8 boxes of ice-cream for friends and family. Everyone who has tasted it is in love with it. I have visited CP store 5 times now. I have taken 32 boxes home in total and with friends combined, we have bought 170 boxes in these 5 visits. And while I have nothing to complain about the ice-cream, the staff needs a reality check. You are serving one of the most premium and food crazy city in India, people value service as much as the food itself. A sincere request to the management is to keep a check on the rude and arrogant behaviour of the staff including shift manager (one Sardarji, around 9 PM). You are a hit but the air that the staff at CP outlet has is quite in the face and repelling. Take it easy please and be nice to everyone. Even if it's once scoop of a non-fruit flavoured ice cream. Be NICE. facebook.com",Rated 4.0,26,47,??
Kamakshi Pal,"Rated This place is Wow..Full of energy and Ice cream that too with unique kind of taste.. We tried Sitafal ,Jack Fruit and kala jamun. Can't decide which one is better because every single flavor is unique by its own and equally good too. I felt like trying all the flavors but seasonal one was not available. Anyway Amazing place .. Now toh I'll visit this place frequency <3 :* It's lovvveeee",Rated 4.0,36,152,??
Rohini Gauba,"Rated I had been waiting for Natural Ice-Cream to open up their outlet in one of the prime locations of the city. After jumping and howling for about 5 minutes outside the outlet, I entered the outlet beaming with energy and happiness. Although, I wanted to try all the flavours at once but could manage oy 3 of them because of the cold weather. Mango, Tender Coconut and Watermelon was what I ordered. Mango- Mildly sweetened this scoop of ice-cream lets you taste real mangoes. Tender Coconut-By far the best flavour I have ever tasted. A MUST-TRY!! Watermelon- Milk based ice-cream with chunks of watermelon. It did not please my taste buds. One can easily skip this one out of their wishlist. Overall, a relaxed ambiance unlike the other ice-cream parlours. Ample seating space. Good place to catch up with your friends on ice-cream. Happy Eating!",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

My friend from Kanpur too became a sentimental fool for this icecream. We had the papaya-pineapple, a watermelon and a custard apple in all. All three were terrific!

Sanya,"Rated For the delhites who have never hear of natural,s..let me tell you its a famous ice cream brand with its roots in mumbai . basically its synonymous with nirulas in delhi. Its popular for making delicious ice-creams with natural ingredients like fruit. So to begin with you should try their famous tender coconut ice cream which is quite smooth and flavourful. I tried coffee walnut as i like bitter ice cream , it was quite rich, with real walnut and taste comparable with coffee. other flavours to try are mango (i have been told its made from alphonso mango) and sitaphal. Naturals has now been added to my favourites list",Rated 3.5,26,81,??
Sushant Arora,"Rated From the house of Natural Ice Cream which originated in Mumbai, comes second outlet of Delhi at Connaught Place. They are popular for unique ice cream flavors prepared from milk and fruits without preservative. AMBIENCE From outside, you may get a impression that it a goods store and may skip while walking. On the ground floor, there is an informal sitting with elongated seats without tables scattered in the area. On the first floor, there are tables with couches and sofa chairs suitable for hanging out with friends. ICE CREAMS They indeed have some interesting form of ice creams. We even tasted some ice cream samples with a special new flavor Gajar Ka Halwa which was yummy and innovative. From the available options we consumed anjeer, papaya-pineapple and sitaphal (sharifa). Now, each one had a yummy flavor and it was difficult to decide which one was best. But still on terms of taste they can be rated as Sitaphal > Anjeer > Papaya-Pineapple. All three ice-creams were soft with little chunks of real fruit. This place is indeed worth the hype with different concept. Though, the number of flavors should be increased.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Both were delicious, yet simple, yet awesome! White theme of the shop is great and gives it very roomy look. Service is quick. Wish they could start accepting credit cards soon.",Rated 4.0,27,7,??
Shreyans Goenka,"Rated Lets leave aside the argument if Natural's live's up to its original outpost or not, because this can give any other ice-cream parlor in the city a run for its money. Today we are seduced by the chains of the West (Haagen Daaz, Movenpick etc.) with their fun flavors and allure of exotic ingredients, so it is easy to forget what fresh ice-cream really tastes like. Natural's in that sense is a step back in time when it was made with just basic ingredients devoid of flavorings like essence, stabilizers, and wacky toppings. Heck! I forgot that ice-cream really just requires three ingredients - fruit, milk, sugar. Yes, you will out on the flavors you are used to (where is the cookies & cream or dulce de leche??) but instead you will discover really fresh, simple ice-cream.",Rated 4.5,59,379,??

Mahendra Kumar,Rated .... aaand it's here in CP too! Been waiting for their outlet to open in Delhi and that to in CP (this is their 2nd outlet in Delhi) for a long time and all that wait was worth it! Natural's ice cream need no introduction they are too awesome to have not tried. Having won hearts in many states they are here in Delhi (I wonder why it took that long). Nice decorated interiors with ample seating in 2 levels. Friendly staff that let you taste any flavours without giving that 'lena hai bhi ya nai!' look ;). I would suggest my favourites sitafal and tender coconut for the first time adventurous. Must visit!!,Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Kamal Arora,"Rated So everybody had heard about natural ice cream by some or the other bombay friend of their's. Me too ,same story. On a random walk in outer circle cp, I found Natural's store,newly open. It's way to spacious and with its interiors done with white the outlet looks very big. I've not had this ice cream in bombay so this was my first and I was excited . Nothing to compare the taste with, even better. So I ordered sitaphal, coconut, anjeer and mango. I liked all of these also they were not extremely sweet. Mild sweetness with 100% fruit flavour. Visit to naturals was a treat. :)",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Went with my frens who have never tasted natural's before and we ordered six flavours. Chikoo, sitafal , anjeer, mango, tender coconut and roasted walnut were the flavours we opted for and as I had the first spoon of sitafal I was mesmerized by the taste.. It was the same taste Which I used to enjoy in Mumbai. Had a gr8 experience but the only thing missing was waffle cone. I hope next tym I visit the parlor they ll provide me ice cream in waffle cone.",Rated 4.5,28,102,??
Aarushi Srivastava,"Rated Well I heard so much about Naturals since a very long time, so much so I was afraid that the expectation is so much, the reality will fall short of it! But nothing like it, it's one of the best Ice cream moments I ever had!! The ice cream is light, airy, fresh and the perfect subtle flavour just bursts in your mouth with bang on precision. Must say the ambience is super cute too, especially the slight vintage and chalk board kind of look is adorable. I tried 4 flavours. Papaya-pineapple, sharifa, tender coconut and coffee walnut. So the best part about the ice cream is that it'll have authentic taste, no preservative kind of effect, the actual taste. My favourite out of the four was papaya-pineapple. The flavours, all of the were exceptionally good. Tender coconut is a must if you like coconut, but don't try if not a fan, the coffee is super. And to top it all sharifa finally in an Ice cream so refreshing! It's seriously a must visit! That ice cream is food-gasm!!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
