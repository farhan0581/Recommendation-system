Dhruv Gupta,"Rated As you enter the place you can smell the pizzas from their beautiful live kitchen. The whole setup of the live kitchen is amazing & according to me the best part of Sbarro. They have a good variety of flavours to offer in both veg & non-veg. I tried their ""veggie delite"" & ""chicken makhni"" pizza. The slices were huge with generous amount of toppings but they tasted a bit bland. I liked the chicken makhni pizza more out of the two. I would like to try their other flavours too in the future. The lively environment of the place surely impressed me. Sbarro deserves a visit by all the pizza lovers.",Rated 3.0,64,48,??

Shruti Goel,Rated Sbarro- NYC pizza chain.. seriously??? Offering some horrible pizza slices. Such expensive items listed on menu without any authentic taste of NewYork state. Moreover the pizza we wanted was not available. Bad service. Unsatisfied,Rated 2.5,30,51,??
Saumya Kaushik,Rated Sbarro has got a serene aura and what astounds me is - The self service counter is never hustle-bustled. They have huge pizza machines and Bingo! Food is prepared right before your eyes. You can actually take a look of how your pizza is baked. Their combos are affordable and the sauce is too home-made. No added flavours. 4.5 on 5.,Rated 4.5,16,73,??

Tapesh Khanna,"Rated It looked an okay place and we were just coming back from a hectic meeting and this place was spotted by my colleague. Intrigued by the name, we entered it. It was comparatively smaller sized than other pizza outlets and served pizzas in individual slices. We were damn hungry that time so ordered the entire chicken Makhani pizza. It was sufficient for the two of us. We suited it up with the soft drinks. I felt that they still need to improve upon the taste.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Ankit Jain [~pO~],Rated Looks like a good pizza place.. But the staff was so dull.. I went with all the enthusiasm after reviewing 7 food places.. I had more energy than the staff.. Freshly made dough (live in front of u) I can get a full loaded veggie delight but not NY veg supreme.. For no reason.. I wana correct myself the staff on Sunday night is not dull but dumb.. When u go to a marriage they have pizza stalls who make pizza and whatever they make is what u get.. This was exactly like that.. Pre-made pizza severed to u after heating..

Vaibhav,"Rated Hi Just went to this place on 30th December 2015 and my take on this place in short are LOCATION This place is located in N Block Connaught Place near Dunkin Donut & Nandos on way to Rajiv chowk from Janpath Red light. AMBIANCE While you enter this place, you tend to give 5/5 for maintaining the place neat & clean. The place is lighted properly, somewhat peaceful when you compare it with Dominos or pizza hut outlet. And mind you I went on Wednesday where they have buy 1 get 1 offer lined up on their Slice & pizza menu. FOOD Availability was an issue since my choice of pizza wasnt available at that point in time so I had Bogo Pizza slice, the more pleasing pizza I find at that point. So as per the offer I got an additional slice. Since they were recently prepared which is surely their plus point, basics were right & surely I enjoyed my pizza slice. Food 3/5 HOSPITALITY Yes, its more or less a self serve outlet. I find staff equally efficient in preparing pizza & making it available. CONCLUSION I personally feel that there initiative of offering freshly prepared pizza should work wonderful although regular dominos/pizza hut customer would find it more expensive. One disadvantage I mentioned is Probability of getting your desired pizza slice is quite less. P.S - we were billed around 152 for these slices. Bill attached for your reference. I don't have any relationship with Sbarro or with their supporting staff. Cheers :)",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Abhishek Bhatia,"Rated This place was unexpectedly better than any pizzeria I have ever been to. Talk about the quality of pizzas, ambience of the restaurant, service, everything was up too the mark. We ordered 4 pizza slices namely chicken tikka, pepperoni, mushrooms and cheese Although the pizzas were reheated before serving, it surely tasted fresh and no one could tell that they were reheated. The pizza was how a new york pizza should be, thin crust with overload of cheese and full of luscioustoppings. The place was air conditioned to that extent that is pleasant and surely took our pizza experience up by a notch. The service was good and was served our pizzas within 2 min of ordering. I was really shocked that such a nice place with good food is so underrated. Compared to Domino's and Pizza Hut this place is far far better and much cheaper as well. We had our delightful meal in about 650 bucks only ( for 3 people). Its surely a place to hangout with friends and have a pleasant time. People should give this heavily underrated pizzeria a chance to prove itself and surely it wouldn't disappoint you. I am really shocked at seeing the disappointing reviews people have given which were not actually true.",Rated 4.0,3,33,??

Kohinoor Koko Sharma,"Rated I look back on my first visit to Sbarro very fondly. It was a friend's b'day & the whole day had been absolute perfection & the amazing chicken makhani stuffed pizza I snacked on was definitely the cherry on the cake for me that day. Unfortunately very little can be said about my most recent visit to my once favourite pizza joint. The outlet, albeit clean, is stuffy. I do understand that it is peak winters however I definitely don't appreciate feeling like I'm being roasted. The staff was friendly and I thought it was really sweet that they helped me carry the trays up but unfortunately thats the only word of praise I have for Sbarro. I ordered a meal for two that included 2 slices of pizza + 2 garlic breadsticks + 600ml bottle of a soft drink (I went with Coke) & a walnut brownie. We also ordered one cheese & sausage Stromboli. The garlic breadsticks were seasoned well & were a refreshing change from the over soggy breadsticks served by Domino's. The pizza was very basic & average, even with all the 'right' ingredients/components it somehow managed to have no flavour, even adding oregano didn't seem to help. The cheese and sausage Stromboli looks absolutely stunning but unfortunately lacked flavour as well, it was indeed cheesy but bland. The walnut brownie was the saving grace and managed to be the only thing that had the right taste. It's sad to see that Sbarro has lost its charm, here is hoping that this review will serve to be a wake-up call to them so that I can maybe in the future visit them again and give them a rave review. For now I rate them a 2 for their mediocre food.",Rated 2.0,25,144,??

Asim Behera,"Rated Standard traditional American fare, big on size but not all that big on taste. I think the modus operandi of reheating an already made pizza takes away a lot of taste and freshness. The crust was way too thick for the amount of toppings. They were out of the lemonade.

The big slices of pizza was looking so decorative, mouth watering and delicious. And yes it was delicious and finger licking. The sausage pizza and red sauce pasta was my selection for the day. It was way good. Staff is equally kind and humble. The only thing they should work on is the payment system bcz its too hectic that first collect the order den wait in the queue with you plates for the bill and till then all your food will go soggy and cold.

Nikhil Tewari,"Rated Two friends meeting up after a long time. Since most eateries were full, we crashed in Sbarro. Ambience resembled a fast food joint and they specialise in pizzas and pasta. The peculiar thing here was that most people ordered a slice of pizza with pasta in order to make a combo. Not being pasta fans, and being born gluttons, we ordered a large 16 inch diameter Veggie supreme pizza as only that could satiate our appetite. And that it did! The Pizza was fresh and cheesy, with a distinct tangy taste to it. Sbarro makes Dominos look like a minnow. The pizza size can put these chains to shame.

The garlic bread was extremely dry which was served with a very weird tasting sauce (dip), veggie pizza slice was highly overloaded with broccoli (like I was being tricked to eat broccoli through pizza) and for drink I had cucumber lemonade which again was a disappointment and tasted neither like lemonade or cucumber.

Kasturi Ramanathan,"Rated Sitaution : A late lunch on a Sunday at CP. Ambiance : across two floors. The serving area is on the ground floor. Seating area is above. About 20 people can comfortably sit. But, if you're having a notoriously loud crowd dining with you, you'll then feel that the place is cramped. The combo meal : worth every penny. For 400 bucks. 2 pieces of garlic bread. 2 slices of pizza. A brownie and a pet bottle. My brother and I decided to pick up a chicken makhani stuffed pizza and meaty pizza. Both the pizzas were decently good. However, I did not care much for the rather hard garlic bread. The brownie was good as well. We picked up a new York cheesecake as well. But at 150 INR. I really did not like it. Almost chocked on it. Too sweet. And the bottom line of biscuit crumble did not hold together. A huge disappointment. And hence the lower rating. Cost : the 400 combo meal is not inclusive of taxes. And the cheesecake was too expensive. Bottom line : worth it for the combo. Better than the regular pizza line of branches around the city.",Rated 3.0,141,472,??
Subhayan Chakraborty,"Rated Sbarro is one of those unconventional yet authentic places, where you have a real shot at satisfying your appetite without emptying your pocket (completely). The place is in the N block at CP, near to Rajiv Chowk Gate no. 5 and 6. It has a very expensive looking storefront, so don't let that intimidate you. :) It's a recreation of the classic new york pizzaria without the overt display of americana and italian-mafiosi imagery I've encountered at other places. There's also ample seating space, being spread out on two levels.While the AMBIANCE is cool, the FOOD is where the real originality comes in.. Sbarro is true to the New York Pizza. Since, I'm not an authority on the subject, never having gone beyond the boundaries of Hindustan and being brought up on Dominos and Pizza Hut, I can't say what a New York Pizza is like. But what I have seen, numerous times in fact, is the classic large american pizza being eaten by characters on sitcoms, tv shows and hollywood. True to that, the pizzas are extra large and taking another glance at the pizza table is suggested before making the order, if you are single or a party of 2. Coming to taste, the new york classic cheese was pretty standard, given its the most inexpensive item on the menu. The soft cheese tastes really nice, although the pizza base was a bit too thin for my liking. The Pepperoni pizza got me. God, did I love the pork pepperoni pieces, laid in neat slices over the soft gooey cheese. I would venture so far so as to say that PRICES are quite in line with what other establishments of this category offers in the CP area. But they were still restrictive enough for me to order only slices and not the whole deal. In that case, the other items on the menu such as the pastas can be tried. SERVICE is always upto a standard at a large establishment like this. But the crew here, apart from being nice, are also really helpful. This is especially true when they see you gawking at the pizzas straight out of the oven.. Chakraborty Tip : This place should be gone to, with a large group of friends, looking for a place outside the usual destinations, having ample place to relax and trying something new. Sharing an Xtra large pizza will do the trick.",Rated 4.0,148,826,??
Vinay Kharb,"Rated Place is NOT recommendable to anyone, it may seem aesthetic from the outside though. And that is a big NOT. Had two kinds of Pasta there and immediately marked Sbarro in the list of places I do not want to visit. Both kinds of Pasta were tasteless to me and other four in the group which makes it five out of five votes against it. Positives -- A nice place to sit with your friends with good ambience.

So we go back n decide we go Punjabi by nature aur any other restaurants. So when we ask to ur server where is Punjabi by nature he asked him what happened so we told him we carry our kids nd we can't do up and down to take everything so he said that's OK don't worry I ll serve u we know his name very well he is abhishek so he tell us just do ur billing process than we will serve u .so what quality at ur server we don't know anything so he help us to choose the great speciality of sbaaro he tell us about the stuffed one so we took a whole pizza of ur NY range .so the pizza was really very nice and authentic and pastas was very fresh n hot .I love the basil flavoured in pasta.so we didn't feel like its self service.abhishek give us a very good service like better then fine dine in I tryy so many restaurants even ur huda one also cz I am a architect of kabab express so easy to find out where is Sbarro .my wife gave him a big choclate for his good efforts .because he go so many time to take the food from downstairs so this is little gift from our side .in the end we talk to ur shift manager also so we tell him we really enjoyed food was very good .this nt just a feedback its a good memorable moments for us we will definitely come back soon.may be next week or next month..

Love the fact that you can view the kitchen and see all sorts of pizza on the display which obviously makes your mouth watery. Tried ""NY Style Pizza"". It was tasty. But one must eat as soon as it comes out of oven otherwise the crust becomes quite hard and it becomes almost impossible to complete it. At least that was my experience. Also Tried the ""Garlic Bread"" but I have to say, Domino's outlets are a better choice, in this case. Recommended to all who love to try different places. The prices are in check.

Comfy and nice, the place is worth a visit but the pizza isn't out of this world. Although that doesn't mean it is bad.",Rated 3.0,172,467,??
Mukta Dhawan,"Rated I anticipated a lot from this place while entering its gates. The place was quite compact but its first floor was well built and spacious. We were two of us and secured a cozy place for ourselves. But here there is the system of self service which was annoying for me. It had a unique system of selling pizzas in slices. It was a bit pricey and the taste was also not that extraordinary. Overall, it was just an okay experience with the food out here.",Rated 3.5,111,569,??

Vaibhav,"Rated SBBARO.! Located in the N-Block Market, Cp this cafe had quite refreshing ambience and looked a promising place to spend a few hours with couple of my friends whom I met after a long time. The place has ample seating area, was well furnished and lit up.. We decided to order first and then get seated. Ordered a combo consisting 3 different NYC style pizza slices: Mushroom olive, veg supreme and spicy paneer along with Spicy paneer stick on the side, Chocolate Brownie for desserts and coke. The spicy paneer was clear winner amongst all the slices with Indianised touch, the other two slices were average but I'll still consider them much better than the options served by their counterpart Chicago Pizza. I would have rated this joint more but the only factor that made me give them less rating were their service, which was slow coz the tables that we selected were not properly wiped and still had some clearance to be done on it and their washroom which had TP's lying on the floor when I entered to use it.",Rated 2.5,28,191,??

So, as fate has it, I landed up at the CP outlet with my younger sister for a sibling lunch and ordered every slice alongside a veg Stromboli. Unlike, the usual servicing at other restaurants it's more of a ""pay before you eat"" system here depending on the slice that is served right out of that huge oven. Besides pizza there's a variety of pasta tossed off a live counter as well that you could enjoy along with your food in the convenient yet comfortable seating laid out in a duplex with food quotes and abstract snaps all around.

Jagriti Sapra,"Rated For some reason I ate a few times at Sbarro's but never reviewed it . Anyway, My friend and I visited this outlet on a rather windy day and the place , as usual , smelled like heaven. Live pasta station , extra large pizzas on display , the fragrance of oven baked goods- There's nothing else a pizza lover could ask for( There were desserts too , so I guess that sums up heaven ) . The scent of garlic bread FORCED us to order more than we intended to eat, so we ordered a Munching Mates meal that included 2 pizza slices ( READ ANY) , 2 portion of garlic bread , a piece of Brownie and a pet bottle of any soft drink. We ordered a chicken makhni stuffed slice and spicy paneer as well - The chicken makhni was THE HERO - STUFFED with chicken, tomatoes ,cheese and peppers , The veg pizza was a bit bland in comparison but was flavorous . The brownie was a bit stiff but was palatable . Garlic bread was crusty on the outside, soft and succulent on the inside , topped with oodles of minced garlic cloves and dollop of butter - but was , again , just a tad bit bland as per my liking( but definitely delectable) . The tomato sauce served along with the pizza was a turn off - Tasted like half cooked tomato puree with water and oil floating around. With minimal decor , BEAUTIFUL fragrance and amazing pizzas - Sbarro is a blessing. I'll definitely be back to grab a slice of pizza ASAP ( and the untried but inviting paneer sticks and pasta and much more )",Rated 4.0,3,27,??
Shakti Nayan,"Rated ""Antediluvian"" is the word to begin with for the preposterous duty of taking food to the counter to generate the bill. In a fast paced city, where anyone can lose their mind seeing a queue, this billing process seemed an onerous task. Having said that, the place is however uniquely designed with good furniture. Lots of space there! A quick scrolling and I found a value meal. 2 slices, a drink and a brownie. All reasonable and indubitable. Ah the taste was average. The pizza crust lacks consistency and people with braces have a challenge. Anyways, the overall pizza slices were good. Taste is amazing! My review isn't over.

My mother decided to have the paneer makhani stuffed pizza while I picked the New York supreme filled with meat and veggies. The pizza slices were pretty huge and with some help from the garlic breadsticks they completely filled us up.I liked the New York supreme, as the vegetables and meat were really nice and ample in quantity but I had a bite of the paneer makhani stuffed pizza and I found it too sweet for a pizza, I couldn't take another bite out of it. My mother somehow loved it.The garlic breadsticks were different which doesn't say they were good, I am a fan of the breadsticks Dominos has to offer and these were strictly okay. Nothing to write home about. The fudge nut brownie was amazing, and rounded up the meal in the best way possible. This place has value for money, and has all the factors to visit it at least once but for some reason, it just didn't feel like a wholesome experience.

LiveTooEat,"Rated SBARRO RETURNS TO FORM Pizzas Just Got Better Pizza and Indians go hand in hand. It sounds funny, but it just feels like a scene from the movie Queen, where KanganaRanaut says, Ive made a French Toast for you guys, and the other guy cuts her off saying, I am full French, this is not French Toast. To which she replies, No, This is Indian French Toast. Such is the story of pizza in India. This foreign export has now become our own. You can easily find pizza cafes in every nook and corner in most Indian cities. Companies nowadays have started experimenting with the pizzas to see if they can offer their customers something different. Keeping in mind the difference, Sbarro, (the Columbus-headquartered pizza chain) has opened their restaurant at Connaught Place in New Delhi. The first innings wasnt that impressive when it came to quality, so hopefully the second innings would be much better. AkhilPuri, the CEO of Jyoti International Foods Pvt Ltd has been instrumental in bringing the Sbarro master franchisee to India. Leading the master franchisee of Jyoti International Foods Pvt Ltd, Chef Rahul Gladwin Massey, alumni of Hotel Management, Pusa, New Delhi has 11 years of professional culinary experience. His professional background includes leading names in the Indian Hospitality Industry such as Uppals Orchid- New Delhi, Orchid- Mumbai, Sarovar Group of Hotels and Resorts among many. He also holds international experience of working with Sunlake Group of Hotels, Indonesia where he worked with Manhattan Hotel, Jakarta and was an opening team member of a 301 room 5 Star property in Jakarta - Merlynn Park Hotel. Ambience As it is an international chain, the basic idea was to keep the interiors pretty much the same as the ones in the rest of the world. Nothing fancy was tried. They kept it very simple with a lot of black, white and grey with a reasonable touch of contemporary. The ambience was also appreciating, but was bent more towards the youth. Basically a typically western-based outlet, one could easily hear loud pop music blaring in the background. The first floor comprised of the sitting lounge, and on the ground floor different sections have been made - like the buffet section, salad section etc. One thing Sbarro does thats different from most pizza places is their completely open kitchen, where one can easily have a look at how the pizzas are being made. Food We started with three of their signature thin crust New York Style pizzas - Cheese, White and Chicken Tikka. The New York White pizza was stuffed with a lot of Ricotta and Mozzarella - and tasted simply delicious. The New York Cheese pizza, their best-seller, was also an interesting choice. The Chicken Tikka pizza was also great - having the kind of flavour which tickled your taste buds. So all the signature pizzas worked out well - in fact, very well. Next up were the Pan pizzas - we tried the Sausage and Jalapenos pizza as well as the Supreme. Both pizzas were soft on the inside - and the outside crust was surprisingly fluffy and crisp at the same time. The combination of the sausage and jalapenos worked very well. The Supreme pizza which was filled with 100 % pork pepperoni, Italian sausages, green pepper and mushrooms tasted phenomenal. The garlic bread, on the side, also tasted very different from the regular garlic breads available in the market. We then moved to the Stuffed Pizzas - which had two layers of crust - above and below - with the stuffing in-between. We tried the Vegetable Extravaganza which consisted of broccoli, spinach and mushroom with peppers - an interesting take on a traditional favourite. The next Stuffed Pizza we tried was the Chicken Makhani - it almost felt like we were having Butter Chicken and Naan - as the taste was very Indian. Overall, the Stuffed Pizzas were an innovative concept and worked out reasonably well. The Sbarro Garden Salad Non-Vegetarian tasted ordinary. It was filled with the pieces of chicken, pieces of bread, corn, broccoli, olives, tomato, onion and lettuce. The mixture of vegetables was good, but the dressing was ordinary and so was the taste. From the pastas, we had space in our stomachs to try only one - a Chicken Alfredo pasta - the chicken was smooth and creamy and was very well cooked. Desserts We started with New York Cheesecake - which was the typical standard baked cheesecake - thick, creamy, sweet and absolutely to-die-for. The quantity was massive - and you would never fall short of the stuff. It could have been even more phenomenal if they gave a strawberry or blueberry compote with it. The second dessert we tried was the Frosted Carrot Cake - served warm - and the blend of chocolate and the taste of carrots going very well together - on the whole, a must try. Overall, Sbarro has improved a lot in these years. Their second innings seems to be much better than their first. They are trying to up their reputation and could succeed if they maintain the same level in terms of providing quality food.",Rated 4.5,15,16,??

Raj K Sekhar,"Rated Conventional and functional Pizzeria. Additional aspects are few, like their menu items. Pizzas, Pastas, unavailable garlic sticks, unnecessarily thrust soft drinks, etc. form the menu. They serve you a slice of the Pizza, which in all honesty, could be much more bigger for the charge. The concept is great, but somewhere that miniature slice of pizza tends to be unsatisfactory. They serve you the entire pizza too, not that they won't. I understand the whole ""International chain of restaurants"" deal, but could be better in many aspects. Billing has to be done before you eat. And from that it should be obvious that it is self service. After being accustomed to being waited by at the restaurants, this is obviously inconvenient. First world problems in a third world country, to be precise. Main topic, which is the pizza, contains average amount of toppings. Again, could be much more, and by that I don't mean topped to every centimeter. This rut of pizza chains have established their scanty toppings as the norm. Cost cutting taken to another level. If only this generation that consumes pizzas for the fashion of it knew that this is not how toppings are provided in foreign countries from where these places originated from, it would be a divine eye opener. Returning to the topic, the base of the pizza is fresh and soft, and perfectly crispy where it is supposed to be. Overall, an average experience, which has been made better with amicable staff that are ever so cheerful.",Rated 2.5,157,1436,??

Another good thing about this place was its pocket friendly prices. Since we are students this is one major point that we look at. Since I eat spicy food I felt that a little spice and flavour was lacking and also there must be a choice of coolers and beverages other than the cold drinks ! So overall my experience was really good and I would love to visit again!,Rated 4.0,7,31,??
Nand Gopal,"Rated Fantastic place. They prepare, bake stuff in front of us. Its quite an experience. The menu is small but the options are good. Meal combos are value for money. The pizza comes not like usual full pizza but its more like a slice of large pizza. Had paneer makhani (quite heavy) and new York cheese (amazing). Though didn't like the garlic bread stick. Very good experience.",Rated 4.0,103,93,??
Shivangi,"Rated The place has unique style to it with ample seating space. I went on a Friday afternoon. There were only few other tables occupied. We had munching mates value meal.

It was fresh, hot, and tasty! Way back, I used to eat at their Nehru Place branch and I know this restaurant since then. They have improved significantly and over the period their pricing has become very attractive and affordable. On my second visit here, I also ordered a Chicken Pep stick and Cheeze pizza slice. It was mouth watering and served hot. What else can you expect in a slice of Cheeze Pizza that costs Rs. 49/- and with taxes included it's just Rs 59/-. It was too good for the price I paid. I also visited their branch at Huda City Center, Gurgaon and that branch of restaurant is better in terms of quality, taste, and portion size.",Rated 4.5,3,11,??

Astha Jain,"Rated Sbarro <3 an outlet famous for its authentic pizza and italian. i love this place. very reasonable, the welcome you get is very pleasing and lifts up the mood, staff is friendly. Despite of so many people not liking the pizzas because of it being bland and flavourless, I LOVED IT. I mean the ingredients are so fresh and it definitely tastes like the REAL-PIZZA. We can watch our food getting made (live kitchen). try pizzas over pastas but not simple cheese/ margarita pizza, its somewhat over chewy.They can work a little on the billing procedure and get it done towards the end of the meal. This will elevate the dining experience.Love the garlic bread sticks and the broccoli and mushroom Stromboli <3 couldn't try the desserts because i am a pure vegetarian :P ** just uploading the very few pictures i have :P",Rated 4.0,34,145,??
Sana Akhter,"Rated We got a lot a pizza places in Delhi , for a new pizza place to embark on a journey afresh is pretty difficult here. A very delightfully relishing kitchen counter is a treat to the eyes. The mushroom stromboli was well stuffed ; generously loaded with cheese could be given a try. Taste is not as impeccable as one could be yearning for . Also broccoli haters - ""do not go for this "" The garlic bread was dry ; we all must have come across better garlic breads in life for sure definitely not satisfying. The pizzas ; exactly what the place is known for definitely comes as a pretty decent surprise. The stuffed pizzas look drool worthy. Beat the heat with Bloody orange lemonade .

Anu,"Rated The decor is nice and the pizzas displayed look mouth watering. But that is probably the end of all good things. The Mushroom and Broccoli Stromboli looked heavenly at the counter but it didnt taste that well. The margherita slice too didnt feel like margherita. Also, while heating up the pizza slice they forgot to take it out of the oven. Though they gave us a new slice themselves such kind of incidents arent expected. The prices are decent according to the quantity but the taste isnt. Maybe the other things are good. Can try once. Food : 3/5 Service : 3/5 Ambience : 3/5",Rated 3.0,8,5,??

Some major points: Taste: yes ! The food is good n delicious a single piece of paneer pizza will make you full n chocolate brownie will make you go ummm... nice and little bit warm served with melted chocolate n cashews over it !! Negatives: the pizza is quite costly X large pizza is off 1,199/- without taxes but if you are group of 7-8 that will be sufficient for all. You can even order a single slice for the same at much lower cost !! This is the single slice of the pizza!! HOPE YOU LIKE THE REVIEW !!",Rated 4.5,4,4,??

Shagun Raizada (Myfoodproject.org),"Rated The good part about brand Sbarro is that they haven't compromised with their quality to stay in the market (unlike Chicago Pizza). Have been eating here since the past 8 years and the quality is still the same. This place is way better than Chicago pizza in terms of quality, toppings and the overall dining experience. The interiors are plain and simple. Nothing too fancy but better than the Nehru place branch that I used to frequent before it shut down. I have always had non-veg pizza slices and not the pastas. The variety is little but the pizzas are good. You can be done in 1.5 slices of a normal pizza. Their stuffed pizzas are pretty good and different. Not something that every pizza chain serves. Stuffed pizzas have filling in between two pizzas bases. This is heavy and 1 slice is sufficient for a person. Sbarro is easy on the pocket and good for a quick, tasty and reasonable meal. myfoodproject.org",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Divya Srinivas,"Rated Owing to the fact that there are numerous Pizzeria's in Delhi/NCR, this one was a pleasant experience, when it came to fine dining. Being an avid pizzerian, the menu and the displayed items gave me multiple foodgasms. Not only are the pizza slices huge in length, but at the price for 399, you get to choose two different pizza slices, two garlic bread toasts, a deliciously mouth watering brownie and an aerated drink! Easy on the money, the place is well lit and spacious. For me one of the most important requisite of any dine-in to flourish or be successful is the staff behaviour and service they have. My friend accidentally dropped her pizza and the staff took care of it immediately, replacing it free of charge with smiles on their faces. Not that we'd have minded paying, which we insisted on, but they stated that 'it was on the house'. Their menu also included a 'healthy' pizza for the diet and the health conscious.

Alright; the so called Chicken Makhani Stuffed Pizza, was only filled with veggies, hardly any chicken; so no taste and only vegetables in it! The veggies ruined it for me; the garlic bread, completely dry, I couldn't take another bite of this thing and the tomato puree or ketchup these guys serve, horrible. I am afraid I'll try anything else from this place.",Rated 1.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Rachit,Rated It was a strange afternoon when I along with my friend noticed the newly opened Sbbaro. We totally wanted to try out this new place. On the first sight I thought their pizzas were a little expensive. But the catch is they serve only slices. And the size of the slice justifies the price. I prefer slices over a whole pizza as you get to try different varieties. The thing I love about this place is their live pasta counter. You can customize your pasta as per your requirements. Will definitely go to this place again.,Rated 4.0,13,18,??

We ordered a pasta and a meal which contained 2 slices of pizza, garlic breads , soft drink and something like chocolate pastry. The pasta was the worst I have ever eaten. It looked like it was not fully cooked. The sause was like red water and the pasta was simply tossed in spices. Pizzas and breads were below average.

The Spaghetti was a bang on! .. loved the consistency and the spaghetti was cooked to the T. The only problem was the quantity which was very less and the dish was half filled. The Garlic bread was Fabulous, it went perfectly with my Spaghetti. The Problem was the Pizza: It looked amazing but it tasted under cooked, very less cheesy and was a disappointment.

Sumit Dey,Rated Sbarro is one of those experiences one must have after having been overfed on a diet of run of the mill pizza chains. This place is different. You see them make your pizza and pasta. The servings are delicious and generous. I suppose the best bit though is you don't have to order an entire pizza just for a slice and can happily end up going through a variety of pizzas. Such a luxury does come with a prize and that is no surprise. But is it worth it? Yes!!! ? Sorry for no photos. Too busy stuffing my face ? Bon Apetit!,Rated 5.0,31,92,??

Gurleen Kaur,"Rated Sbarro is located in N block in connaught place. Its quite a big place with self service. At first glance on the menu, i felt that the prices were a bit on the higher side but the size of their slice justifies it well. Also, they have a combo meal of Rs.399+taxes which includes 2 slices of pizza(any slice of your choice), 2 pieces of garlic bread, one 600mL bottle of a cold drink and a brownie. I found this very economical so i ordered this combo with the paneer supreme slice and chicken makhani slice and also a chicken alfredo pasta. The food looked great. But for me, the taste was just average. The paneer supreme slice had too little sauce and was quite dry and hard. The chicken makhani slice was nice though, it wad crispy, fresh and the filling was nice too. The garlic bread didnt have a lot of garlic flavour but it was nice. The pasta was a total dissapointment. Too little sauce and quite bland too. Didn't like it at all. The brownie was a winner. Was fresh and tasted heavenly. An average place for me. Would i go there again? Maybe, but the chances are quite low!",Rated 3.5,41,331,??

Located in the N-Block, this place was fully occupied and we had to wait for a seat. In the meantime we decided to check out the food counters and place an order. Sbarro is a self service restaurant that gives you the choice of ordering slices of pizza instead of ordering an entire one which I thought was a good option as one gets to try the various pizzas offered on board. We ordered the NY-Supreme and the Veggies Delight Pan Pizza and also ordered an Alfredo Pasta which was prepared in the live counter right at the entrance of the store so you can choose the vegetables and ingredients that go into your pasta! The Pizzas were delectable- from the crust to the toppings- and the white sauce pasta lived upto its expectation too.

Niharika Sinha,"Rated Sbarro is in the N block of cp and if you are commuting by metro take an exit from gate number 5. Its good place to hang out with friends if you want to have delicious pizza but don't have the capacity to eat the whole pizza because they charge you on per slice basis. When you enter the place, you will see a lot of XL size pizzas on the counter on the right. So you can see the pizza there and enquire about it and ask for a slice or the whole one and they will heat it in the large oven they have! They have garlic breads and chicken breadsticks(which has chicken salami baked inside it) also in on the same counter. Adjacent to the Pizza counter is the pasta counter where they make the pasta in front of you and you can tell them which veggie you want which you don't want. So this place is a self service. We ordered two slices of chicken pizza which tasted really good. The crust, cheese and chicken was of the right quantity. We also ordered garlic bread in which we barely tasted the garlic though it was a well baked bread. Also we ordered chicken breadstick which tasted just fine. The brownie was good though I have had better brownies. We ordered a red sauce arrabiata which didnt taste very good. It was just fine. They have painted the wall white and I didnt find anything unique in the ambience. Though the pizza tasted good, I feel they can improve the taste of other food items they serve. All in all, Easy to find: yes Food: 3.5/5 Ambience: nothing so special Service: self-Service Recommended: Though there are various restaurants in cp which serve better food and have a better ambience, you can go there sometimes if you wish to have good pizza.",Rated 3.5,43,316,??

Amarendra Shrivastava,"Rated I visited this restaurant 3 months ago with my friends. Couldn't get time to write a review though I desperately wanted to write one. Finally, I got a chance and I will try to put up every little thing I felt about this restaurant. So, I got to know about this place from Zomato, thanks to Zomato. What really attracted me to this place was their stuffed pizzas and I really wanted to try one. Unfortunately, I couldn't get my hands on the stuffed pizza as they weren't available the time I visited the place. The place was nice with proper lights, not too bright nor too dull. A decent sitting arrangement and not too clumsy. You first have to order and after you recieve your order you'll have to pay the bill and continue with your food. The staffs were nice as they listened to everyone and even suggested us on our pick. Anyways, we ordered a stuffed pizza but due to its availability issues we changed it to a Pan Pizza, PAN- Sausage & Jalapeno, Sausage and Cheese Stromboli, Creamy Chicken Pasta and for the drinks we had Blood Orange Lemonade, Cucumber Lemonade and one coke of course in case we didn't like the drinks. Coming to the Stromboli, Sausage and Cheese, as the described it, it was actually cheesy and I liked the taste. Actually the crew serving us suggested it and yes it was very good. The next was the pasta, not to forget that you get both the options to select from, the spaghetti and the penne. The pasta was delicious. It said creamy chicken and yes! It was creamy with chicken which seemed to me like chicken salami. But it was tasty anyways. The Pizza... Hell ! I visited this place for the pizza. Though I couldn't get what I wanted but what we got instead wasn't impressive. The base of the pizza was too hard and I could hardly see cheese on it. I dunno what went wrong but I was really really disappointed. The drinks were fine and we never thought that we won't be needing the coke. So, that would describe the drinks fine enough. And yes I guess they value the customers because from the day I went to this place, I've been receiving texts to visit again constantly and yes, I will visit the place again hoping that I'll find the stuffed pizza and try that so that I could tell you guys about it then.

We tried a super sized veggie extravaganza pizza along with a brownie fudge and chicken salad. The pizza was large enough to fully fill the hungry stomach of three people.

We also want to have a bit of a conversation while eating.",Rated 4.0,3,0,??
Jasmine,"Rated Serve human Hair pizza special..... Visit if you want to eat human hair..... Today's experience has made me rewrite and retract the previous review I wrote for sbarro...... Today I found this place full of people and as always their staff was slow in taking our order.... And at the payment counter.. The staff refused to process a discount coupon sent by sbarro and had to call someone else to help them use it...... When we found hair in the pizza we approached the staff who were apologetic but their manager Was arrogant and rude... He almost accused us of having placed the hair ourselves..... I would never advice anyone who wants to visit this place to look for hair and wish zomato allowed me to give this place a zero rating......... Please find my first review below to show that I happened to like this place earlier and am not some random person criticizing them First review Nice place. Love the clean, simple pla sophisticated New York inspired ambience. Ordered a slice of the pizza along with the brownie. It's a value for money place. The taste was good.

Kamal Deep Singh,Rated It is located in Connaught place. 1. Ambience is ok. Nothing to talk home about. Music selection is good though songs could have been latest. 2. Good selection of pizza and pasta. This time I had both of their white sauce pastas and liked both. 3. Seats and decor is where they should work on. 4. The only thing not to like is drinks other than soft drinks are not available. This is no where mentioned and you only get to know that when you are placing an order.,Rated 3.0,99,216,??
Ami Joshi,"Rated Pizzas here are better than the ones we are accustomed to, but definitely not the best. I'm not really a huge fan of the 'buy a slice of already cooked pizza' concept. Even though they reheat the slice, it just doesn't taste the same. My advice is, ask your friends to join in and buy the whole thing. It will be freshly baked for you and that is when you'll notice it's superiority over the other regular pizzas. 1 pizza fills up 3 people very well. What I'm a fan of here is the cheese cake. Tastes exactly the same each time! Simply love it's crumbly-creamy texture and cinnamon-y crust :D I will visit again to try their pastas. It always smells like Italian-heaven in there when the chef at the counter is cooking one.",Rated 3.5,29,203,??

Vishnu Kesarwani,"Rated Good things about the place, quick service decent pricing and awesome taste. Thing that you may not like is to order then carry food to cash counter and getting billed whilst your food is losing it's temperature. One of the must try is their stuffed pizza which is similar to calazone however the taste is more on side of Indian fusion. All in all my recommendation is to surely try the place on days when you are just looking for simply the pizza and pasta on ur plate.",Rated 3.5,39,27,??

Gagan Sharma,"Rated Sbarro is a bit different from your run of the mill pizza houses. The variety is good. The Stromboli is awesome. And the Stuffed Veggie Extravaganza is a surprisingly good tasting combination of veggies we avoid as pizza toppings.

Gunjan Sawhney,"Rated Delhi food circuit is long deprived of an authentic Italian food joint. Breaking the clutter of QSRs failing to deliver us with sumptuous Pizzas, is Sbarro Restaurants in the city. The flavours and aroma of the authentic New York Style pizzas is delivered beautifully by Sbarro. They are currently operational with two branches in Delhi- NCR. My tryst with Sbarro began at their very interesting campaign previously done by the brand. They introduced the concept of Man V/S Pizza and used Social Media brilliantly to collaborate with bloggers and test their ability to eat giant pizza slices in a stipulated time limit! Hand tossed and fresh dough, with toppings of fresh ingredients makes Sbarro my favorite for a quick meal. Also, I love how they have customized few flavours to cater to the Indian taste buds. It is indeed commendable to bring Indian flavours and aroma while keeping the authenticity of their signature style of pizzas intact. Located at two most convenient locations of the city, Connaught Place and Huda City Centre, Gurgaon Sbarro enjoys a huge crowd from both working professionals and youth. Easy to reach both by metro and car, Sbarro enjoys good walk-ins of their NY style pizzas. Apart from ease of location and lively ambience, Sbarro also delights us with three variants of pizza crust New York, Pan Crust and Stuffed Crust. Corporate chef Rahul Gladwin Massey heads the Sbarro outlet in NCR, and strives to stick to the original international menu with only a few minor additions of pizzas for Indian Palate. Rahul is an eminent name in the hospitality sector and holds an expertise in the Indian culinary industry. FOOD Veggies Delight Pan Pizza: This combination is a treat for vegetarians. It is indeed a rarity for a dedicated chicken lover like me to appreciate a vegetarian pizza that much. As much as I was excited to see a Broccoli on my giant pizza slice, the flavour alleviated the joy to next level! New York Style White Cheese Pizza: Apart from Mozzarella, Sbarro also offers a variant with my favorite Ricotta cheese. A pizza slice with oodles of Cheese, yet so light and oil free? Yes, that shall take time to sink in. Feast on this slice and you wont be disappointed to miss out on those crazy spicy toppings! Stuffed Chicken Makhni Pizza: It is inevitable for any foreign brand to customize themselves according to the taste buds of the localities. Sbarro, however kept their authenticity intact despite of customizing to spicy North Indian aroma. The pizza has succulent, and perfectly marinated chicken pieces stuffed between the two layers of dough. The tangy sauce, and the generous quantity of stuffing simply makes this one a favorite! Tomato Basilico Pasta: The tangy Red Sauce Pasta tastes delicious with the toppings of shredded Cheese, Corn and Olives. A little less on the spice quotient, it is light and tangy. Also, watching it being made at the live pasta station alleviates the taste of the dish to another level! NY Pepperoni: Sbarro holds an astounding record of having a generous quantity of 9 pieces of juicy, perfectly cooked, and aromatic bacon on one slice! The sight is itself a visual treat for the eyes and nothing less than a foodgasm. One slice is enough to take away your appetite! Highly recommend you to try this and perhaps thank me later. To end your meal on a sweet note, Sbarro also offers two delectable varieties of desserts. New York Cheesecake: Gooey, fresh and definitely a must try for people with a sweet tooth. The crispy biscuit base is the highlight. It is a fresh change from the usual desserts offered at restaurants. Fudge Nut Brownie: Because meals that end with a scoop of chocolate are often the best ones! Fudge Nut Brownie topped with chocolate sauce sounds like an intelligent addition to the menu keeping it light and delicious. gluttonygoddess.com",Rated 5.0,53,715,??

They served already prepared pizza slices which were there on the display for a long time. And they have self service so I had to wait for a long time on the counter as the stale pizzas were getting warm in the oven.

The pizza was nothing extraordinary but tasted pretty well. Loved the olives and the soft warm cheese topping. Its 3 out of 5. However, it was the pasta that was worth the money spent. It was very subtle in taste and you could feel the flavor of evrything added to it. The olives, fresh onions and the greens came with their own burst of flavor ,blending in very well with the white sauce. The pasta was soft and I would give it a 4.5 out of 5.

The garlic breadwere rough and tasted like a simple bread and were not baked properly. 4. There was not even a single thing which I liked about this place.

Hungry Khan,"Rated We ordered around twelve pizzas from here for a huge party. We ordered the following pizzas: 1. White cheese: cheesy but good. Good for people who like to go norm core with their pizzas. 2. Chicken tikka: overall meat to vegetable ratio was good. But the sauce could be improved. The chicken was good quality. 3. Veggie supreme: it had broccoli so plus points for that. Good for health conscious types. Again sauce needs to be improved. 4. Margherita: my favourite. Huge portion size and the cheese and sauce were good. 5. Mushroom and olives: liked the combination and cheese to sauce ratio was good too. In conclusion the pizzas were alright but could improve more on the sauce and the cheese. Delivery was fine. Was miffed because they didn't have an option to pay online, especially when such a large sum was involved.

Still have the vivid memories of going to the foodcourt with my parents and always pointing towards the large pizza they always used to diplay in front of their counter when my parents asked what i wanted to eat. I was really scared before entering the restaurant regarding the taste of the pizzas and was doubting whether it would be as good as i could remember. And to my utter surprise, the NY slice was as goid as i remembered it to be. The garlic bread along with the dip was scrumptious. And now they serve it in cutlery rather than those cardboard plates in which they used to do it in the past. Overall must visit place for any pizza lover. I have never tried their pastas and looking forward to try them. Hopefully theyll be great as well.",Rated 4.5,65,108,??
Priyanka Johri,"Rated We had the value meal for 399. Which after taxes cost us 471. It includes any 2 pizza slices of your choice, 2 garlic bread pieces, one brownie and one pet bottle of any cold drink. So yeah, its expensive if you ask us students :/ But the food made it up for the high prices..well almost! So here goes - After a lot of discussion ( we might have annoyed the guy behind the counter! :P ), me n my friend finally decided to take a Chicken Makhani stuffed pizza slice and a Pepporoni pizza slice. I would give a 10/10 to both those pizzas, in terms of taste, texture, everything! They were delicious! :D The chicken stuffing in the stuffed Chicken Makhani pizza was moist yet did not make the pizza base soggy and neither did it keep falling off from the slice while eating. It was very well flavored. Just fabulous taste! The Pepporoni pizza was just WOW! These guys didn't leave even a single cubic micromillimeter space uncovered on the pizza surface!!! :D And the Pepporoni tasted amazing! It didn't get all hardened because of the oven, it was moist and juicy. :) So both these pizzas are a must try for everyone! But the garlic bread didn't work for any of us. It was bland. And maybe a bit dry. But it was certainly no way near a garlic bread. You could call it a tiny cute little loaf of bread! But then the pizzas were so good, the garlic bread didn't matter much! And finally the brownie. It was an ordinary brownie. Perfectly chocolaty. Neither moist nor crumbly - a cake-y brownie it was! Next time I am going to have the pastas... they looked good while being prepared at the counter! :)",Rated 4.0,54,824,??
Eeshan Bhatnagar,Rated I don't normally upload photos but THIS IS HUGEE! Sbarro serves good pizzas and their stuffed ones really stuff you.

Menu wasn't up to the mark. CHEERS!,Rated 4.0,37,93,??
Kamal Arora,"Rated I really liked the concept of live pasta and choosing the slice of pizza you wanna eat just like you were in a super market. That's what you notice when you enter Sbarro. PASTA-They have few sauces in pasta- Arrabiata, Alfredo and their home made Bolonganise. I went with penne Arrabiata which was a decent pasta which lacked little seasoning as per my taste. PIZZA- They have quite a variety in here. And I really liked the way they were presented. Just on the other side of a glass. You can see through the pizza and tell the chef what you want and they warm it in a big oven right in front of you. I went with New York style chicken tikka and a Chicken stuffed makhani pizza. These were genuinely good tasting pizzas and can be eaten again . DESSERTS- I ordered a New York cheesecake slice and a basic brownie and both of these looked really sophisticated. I was disappointed with cheesecake as it gave a bitter aftertaste of vanilla but the brownie was a good one. Overall Sbarro is a nice place if you wanna enjoy Italian dishes with American twist in them with Indiaianised flavours.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Since, we were looking for a quick bite, we decided to go for a slice each of Veggie Supreme and Mushroom pizzas. - Veggie supreme was good. Thin crust, crisp and the vegetables too were crispy. - Mushroom pizza was also good. They'd used the mushrooms with the cheeze which was a good combination. - The lemon cheesecake however, was a disappointment. It tasted as if it was not fresh.

Ankush Mohanty,"Rated Nowadays, CP has turned into one big circle of eating joints with so many outlets of International and Local brands cropping up everywhere. One of them is Sbarro which has opened up in the N Block. With its many varieties of Pizza slices, this place is a good crowd puller for people who would like to enjoy a good meal in economical prices. The place also offers a variety of combo offers as well which has the Pizza slice of the day with garlic breads. They even have localized their menu to satisfy the Indian taste buds with the introduction of Chicken Makhani Pizza. I went for their Cheese pizza slice. It looked so yumm that I just wanted to grab it from the display unit directly. A combination of dairy mozzarella with their classic tomato sauce was filling and also good for taste buds as well. Unfortunately, I had someone who actually ordered the Chicken Makhani Pizza (Yes, Yes, I need to change the people I hang out with..!) So this pizza slice is actually a stuffed pizza slice wherein there is the sauce which is inside a 2 layer pizza slice. The cheese on top wasnt as appetizing the one on the cheese pizza or any other slice that they have in their menu. I do not know how many people would like it but I would like to give them one suggestion Please include the green pudina chutney and also the vinegar onions to complete the dish! (Note Not a big fan of Butter chicken pizza or even butter chicken pasta!) One should definitely try their garlic breads as they are soft and something different in terms of the flavour that they pack. The bread sticks come with a tangy tomato salsa which complements the heavy garlic flavour. One very important thing to note is that their 1st floor sitting arrangement is spacious but the tables were not cleaned and flies were hovering above the dirty tables! Please try to clean the tables as soon as the patrons leave. It doesnt give a good sight as one is entering with their own plate of food. All said and done, if the minor glitches can be fixed then the Sbarro is a nice place to hang out with friends and family for a quick bite.",Rated 3.0,103,370,??

This place has a great ambience...As u enter u ll get to see a set of chairs n tables that can accommodate almost 10 people and the workspace ie the kitchen n next the counter.. So it's like u can see what u r served n how pizza being done in oven and the live pasta shelf of course.. Coming to the food, we ordered a veg combo meal which had penne arabiatta with a piece of garlic bread, salad n coke! Pasta was simply the worst I would have ever had! It was simply bland...no taste at all not salty tangy or spicy at it should have been.. Salad was another thing simple lettuce olives corns n cucumber packaged! Like seriously this is what kind off salad is served these days? No dressing salt lemon or anything.. After this whole thing I couldn't stand that place for a minute more or else I would have gone for a pizza.. To add more to it was the service! The one at the billing counter was not clear n sounded as if she hardly had any account of their menu.. While serving the food I had to tell them thrice to complete the order..

Yatin Gursahaney,"Rated Totally different concept, Value for money and Super large pizza slices. This is what Sbarro is all about. It wasn't really crowded on a Sunday evening unlike other Pizza outlets. I thought may be people don't know about this place or probably they don't like the concept or the taste may be. But I was so wrong about the concept and the taste. Here is a quick review about what I ordered 1. Pepproni pizza combo- One of the best Pepronni Pizza I've had. The taste was amazing and the meat was really fresh. Just one suggestion- the pizza needs just a lil' more cheese. Or else the pizza is really good. 2. Stuffed Chicken Pizza combo- Not sure which one was the best. The pepproni or the stuffed chicken. This is another master piece by them. Beware- If you don't have a good appetite then you need a partner to finish this. :D 3. Chicken Makhni- Everything was on the table in 5-7 minutes except this. This took a lil' more time. And when it was finally ready the manager there offered us another complimentary slice of our choice as an apology. I mean Whaaa??? Who does that?? I really appreciate what he did. Just wow. Anyway coming back to the Pizza. Another tasty thing on the table. 4. Paneer Pizza (Not the exact name)- This Pizza was good too. Not as good as the non-veg pizzas though. Note- The combos comprise of 1 Garlic bread and 1 Drink of your choice. Combo for 2 comprises of 1 Garlic bread each and Pet bottle of a drink of your choice and a Chockate brownie which also really good. Fresh and the melted chocolate was superb. The bread was fresh too. An attendant there saw us enjoying the music and offered us that we can make a choice of our own favorite song. I mean I haven't seen any Pizza Joint do that ever. 4.5 stars. 0.5 deduction because your pepproni needs a lil' more cheese. Haha. Keep up the good work.

Gurneet Kaur,"Rated When I heard great reviews for Sbarro from my cousin in the US, I knew I had to eat here. Today was my second visit here and I must say that they have only improved since the last time. Two floors of sitting area leaves lesser number of customers standing and waiting. The most amazing thing is the live pizza station wherein pizzas are prepared right from the scratch in front of everyone. It kinda makes the whole experience very special. The pizza slices are huge and if one opts for their combo, then it serves one well. The pizzas are fresh, generous topping, delicious pizza sauce. The salads are ok, wish they had more quantity. Brownie was the perfect way to end the meal. The pizzas are reasonably priced and taste amazing.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The staff is very welcoming and helps with the order. Things I disliked- 1. The payment counter is in the corner near the staircase.

The pizzas here are great, pocket-friendly, quick service, quite hygienic and large dine-in space is available. I had a meal- two pizza slices : Chicken Makhani and chicken tikka NY Style, two garlic breads a coke and a brownie- which was totally worth the 399 bucks.

Staring with the positive notes: I find the ambiance to be good with lively staff helping and suggesting you their best content and making you update about the day's offers. I liked the NY style concept of slice pizzas which we less in NCR as you can try out different slices of different pizzas if you are alone or with one companion unlike picking up an entire pizza. Moving on to food: I tried Supreme Pizza, White Penne Pasta and Salad. I felt that the Pizza could be little more cheesy and shiny as it felt dry to me. The pasta and Salad was Average.

ChicLifeByte,"Rated This was my second visit to Sbarro. Working hard is their main aim & delivering quality service to consumers who consume their loverly & tasty food. I was very well tempted again to try their food because it looked delicious from the glass & yellow lights falling on each food item. I took a table on the first floor and sat where the light was perfect for the food to look tempting & delicious and break & melt in my hands & mouth simultaneously. I ordered Spicy Paneer Pizza which was Desi paneer tikka on New York style cheese pizza. The crust was fine & crisp that you love for & fall in every bite. The second was Chicken Tikka pizza which had spicy chicken tikka with Paprika. It was juicy especially the Chicken (fresh, juicy, ripe & very hot) with Paprika sending my taste buds to relish the tikka taste of the awesome & yummy pizza. It was finger licking with cheese & dollops of hotness to provide sync with the already lovely flavours enhancing them all the more. Now to talk about their PAN PIZZAS I had the biggest crush on the superly awesome Veggies Delight Pizza which was full of nutrition and healthy vegetables. I loved the cauliflower & broccoli substitution effect. I was completely lost in the taste and it tasted awesome with cheese & black olives. It was loaded with seasonal & nutritional elements so a healthy and great option for Veg lovers and kids who love to gorge on vegetarian stuff. The sausage & jalapeno pizza was really hot but delicious, tempting and amazingly soft to taste & bite coz there were Italian sausages & spicy green jalapenos with bell peppers which made it more attractive & colourful. It was flavoured well with spices & tasted fresh. I loved it and all people should try it for the love for the Italian food. The chicken Arrabiata Penne pasta i.e. chicken with spicy tango tomato sauce was relishlingly awesomely amazing. It was simply made & was not too spicy and is freshly made right in front of you. I digged into the bowl of sumptuousness and flavour tossed healthily in a manner that you would love to eat and the black olives superbly enhanced the flavour with all the Italian herbs and seasonings. The garlic bread served along was so fresh as if directly picked from the farm (very soft & mushy). The spicy paneer stick i.e. the pizza sticks filled with jalapenos and yummy paneer was surprisingly good and I loved it. It was perfectly baked with the right amount of filling. The Chicken pep stick was pizza sticks filled with chicken pepperoni and cheese. I found it to be a little spicy wrapped with all the goodness of the warm pepperoni inside. I also had Sbarros Garden vegetarian salad which contained fresh cucumber, tomato, corn, romaine, olives, garlic croutons with lots of Italian dressing. The dressing on the pasta was right and the veggies were garden fresh . The Fudge Nut Brownies contained lots of chocolate fudge and chocolate sauce with nuts on the top and was relishing. Their New York cheesecake is my favourite dessert there. It was soft, fresh cheese cake on biscuit base. It was superb. Lastly, I tried the chocolate mousse which came in a small cup and had layers of chocolates. Good texture & tasty overall! The ambience is great. The music soothes and more importantly the big posters on the wall depict love for the Italian so whatsoever reason be it go here for the taste and spice of togetherness.

Atin Mehrotra,"Rated Visited for lunch since was bored of the boxed pizza. Ambience is good and warm and they are successful in pulling the youth. Liked their concept of serving sliced portions. Its a self service restaurant and you have to place and collect the order before paying for the items. Pizza was fresh and was right out of the oven with sumptuous toppings which were well distributed and making the slice attractive enough to make you salivate. Both, Pan and Thin crust are equally good. Taste is more continental and their pizza sauce doesn't have the spiciness like Domino's. So generous sprinkle of chilli flakes recommended for people looking for that extra zing. Garlic bread sticks were a bit dry and tasteless hence suggest to have put more butter and garlic in them while baking. Walnut Brownie turned out to be one of the best I had with apt sweetness and bitterness of dark chocolate. All in all a good meal for 2 people in less than 500 (2 slices+2 G.bread sticks+Walnut brownie+Drink of your choice).

Tasty pizzas, although they're not as thin crusted as you'd expect them to be , but they're tasty. The garlic breads are really tasty. The brownie however was pretty average, nothing great.

We took their Munching Mates offer which allows a Pet Bottle of Coke, Brownie and 2 slices of Pizza. We had a spicy paneer slice, veg delight slice, mushrooms and black olives slice and chicken spice slice. All of these were delicious on their own levels. Describing the crust and toppings- sbarro has thick crusts and well spread toppings. The taste is great if consumed piping hot. The moment it starts to cool not everyone might appreciate it. We also had a white sauce pasta which was freshly tossed in front of us. The best part about the place is self service and the idea of open kitchen which enables everyone to see what they are having and how it is prepared.

What was the favourite after the pasta was their Cheese Cake. About rightly sweet, nicely textured, it made for a good dessert! The best part about Sbarro is that they have a Live Pizza and Pasta Station- so you order, get your food, and then pay; which is a good change from the take your order after you pay the bill or pay your bill after you eat setup.

Anand Vaidyanathan,"Rated Sbarro is back with a bang! It had been a long time since I visited one( the last time being in Saket fours years back) and so, walking into a Sbarro with live pizza and pasta counters was like a breath of fresh air. The menu has a good number of pizzas and pastas to choose from and the best part is that one can order a single slice or an entire pizza. There is also an option to combine different slices instead of a single pizza. We all love the sight of our food coming but seeing it being made in front of our eyes makes waiting worthwhile. If I look back and compare, Sbarro has made considerable improvement in the two main aspects of quality and dining experience. I had the following from their menu today - Paneer Makhani Pizza - If I had this dish with eyes closed, I could have easily mistaken it to be paneer makhani with naan. The taste was just perfect! Garlic bread - I must say that this is one of the few places where I could bite into a garlic bread and find chunks of garlic in it. Unlike other places, there was no overpowering smell or taste of garlic and it was just right. Penne Arabiatta - The reason why some people dislike arabiatta is the tanginess, which has been perfectly taken care of by Sbarro. The pasta is mildy sauced, making it a good dish even for those(like me) with an aversion to tomatoes. A bread roll with loads of cheese, mushrooms and brocolli. For dessert, we had the delicious New York Cheesecake with a sizeable portion of cheese. I spent an hour in the outlet and within that period of 60 mins, I saw it change from deserted to fully occupied which is a good indication of Sbarro regaining its lost ground. The best part of dinning at Sbarro is the value for money it offers in comparison to others in the market.

Shashank,Rated ONLY YOUR WIFE MIGHT GIVE YOU MORE TOPPING THAN THEY DO. Trust me! What blew me away was the quantity of toppings. I ordered a Pepperoni pizza and the chef gave me 10 pepperonis on a single slice. I repeat more than what you find in the entire pizza from Domino's. This is a wonderful addition to the pizza loving community. This encourages foodies who do not want to order a full pizza from Domino's but just want to grab a slice of their favourite pizza. The combos are cool. The only drawback can be the unavailability of some pizzas whenever you order. So this restricts the menu.,Rated 4.5,30,46,??
Urvashi,Rated Sbarro has been my favorite for a while now. Its a great place to hang-out or catch up due to availability of complete privacy.

Sunmeet Singh,"Rated Sbarro was suggested by a friend when I told her that I wanted to eat something Italian-ish. The place was good as you can see in the photos. Unique food ordering. You can order a slice of pizza which has a good size with enough toppings for you to not cry. -Food: Penne Veggies Delight is what I ordered first. Ok. It's pasta(For those who don't understand penne). Its got a nice flavour but the sauce wasn't thick enough for me to be able to actually taste it. I had to dig down to the bottom to actually taste the flavour it had. The sauce was like this very thin puree. The Garlic Bread they offer with pasta has a real nice taste. Though it ain't crunchy like the one you get at Pizza Hut but it's got this nice salty flavour to it (which the Pasta lacked). Stuffed Paneer Makhani is what they offered when I asked them 'What's the best you got in Veg'. It comes with a tomato sauce which is exclusively made by Sbarro to replace the regular ketchup. Before I tell you anything about the Pizza, let me tell you that this sauce that they've 'invented' sucks. At first it tasted unique. But soon I realised that it's just the puree of fresh tomatoes. Had no salt. No taste whatsoever but tomato. The guy next to me asked for ketchup and that is how my meal got saved. Small ketchup pouches. The pizza had a nice thick crust both above and below. The stuffing was mainly obviously Paneer and capsicum. Paneer had a really nice texture to it. Every bite you take, you feel the paneer. Although it wasn't that tasty. It lacked the X factor. Just too regular to be the best they got. -Ambience: As you enter, you see this open kitchen which says Live Pasta as they cook it just when you order (Don't forget to tell the chef to make the sauce thick and enough). Then there's this exhibition of pizzas you can choose from. Not the biggest range in the market though. You take your food to the billing counter where you pay the bill (Rs187 all in for the Veggies Delight pasta and another Rs187 for Stuffed Paneer Makhani in my case). Got two floors. Enough space for a get-to-gather. *A good place for meetings and discussions. Peaceful environment with soothing music. The good thing, they've got charging points below your seat on the first floor. (Like wooooooowwww, most of which don't work though). -Hygiene: The chef looked good enough to me, exhausted though. And my stomach didn't ache so ya, the food's hygienic. Overall, a one time visit for me. I am done with this one. See you.",Rated 2.5,7,187,??

The idea of a live counter for pasta is so good but i do not like my pizzas prepared beforehand and just served after being warmed. The garlic bread was fairly nice and the drink served was cool. The brownie was great and that too eggless. Overall a nice experience.",Rated 4.0,39,69,??
Niyati Agrawal,"Rated Sbarro even though had a small range to choose from, had amazing quality pizza. The garlic bread too was freshly baked and served hot. I'd highly recommend this place to someone who is looking for something beyond the clich pizza outlets. Recently set up, it is a clean and hygienic place to dine in with friends and family. The pasta (Arabiatta) was the only thing that did not taste good.",Rated 3.5,17,191,??
Rini,"Rated Sbarro My new lunch spot Okay, how it works here is - choose your pizza (staff will place it in a plate for you), carry the plate to the billing counter, pay and eat. Simple! I ordered a Value Meal @99 and a slice of NY Style Chicken Tikka Pizza (NY and Chicken Tikka in the same plate, what an irony!). Anyway, both the pizzas were equally amazing. Slices are huge and generous with toppings unlike Pizza Huts and Dominos. FYI One Value Meal consists of a slice of NY Style Cheese Pizza, one garlic breadstick and a serving of fizzy drink. Only item that can be modified in a Meal is the choice of drink (some 3-4 Coca Cola owned brands). Plenty of seating spread across two floors. Not only are they a pioneer in selling pizza in slices; they also have a live kitchen for pastas which I am gonna try very soon. Extremely warm and polite staff makes sure to say a Thank You! when you walk through that door. For 2 pizza slices (one veg/non-veg), one garlic bread and a medium Fanta, all I paid was a jaw-dropping, all inclusive, INR 245!!! I am so done with the McDs and KFCs and BKs now.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Love to go their again n again :),Rated 4.0,7,1,??
Neha Nagda,Rated A must try at the given price. Went for the combo veg meal and the live pasta really makes it happening. Pizza choices are wide and I personally like the slice system there.

Harsh Rathore,"Rated Well Sabarro is an italian food joint and a good alternative of pizza hut and dominos. It is situated near the parking in connaught place, so parking is not a problem. Staff was good and the ambience was also very nice, but one let down was the limited options. They make pastas in front of you and you can customise it which is a very nice thing. Pizzas and pasta have the italian flavour. If you are a fan of italian cuisine then you should definitely try it.",Rated 3.5,7,55,??
Anandarup Dutta,"Rated This is one of their outlets that usually is fully stocked with almost everything on the menu. Good pizzas, good ambience. Try their deserts including the carrot cake and their New York cheesecake along with your traditional pizza. I would recommend the Brooklyn Heights or Stock Exchange. The sauces are blended well so as to jot overpower the cheese. Cheers!",Rated 4.0,30,242,??

Somdatta Roy,"Rated Pizza Hut and dominos are too monotonous now . Tried sbarro. With a rating of 4, it was a disappointment. Firstly, they have limited pizzas. They only had 4 options available. Tried classic cheese and sausage with pepperoni. Both were average in taste. What it lacked was the seasoning. Mere oregano cannot help. It was in some way bland in taste. Service was very quick. Staff was friendly. Ambience was nice . But hardly any crowd . There were only 3 people other than us. The restaurant does have potential but needs to work on the taste to catch the attention of the crowd. Price was very reasonable but in spite of that, it wasn't value for money.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Akanksha Sharma,"Rated Located in one of the most crowded blocks of CP, Sbarro serves a bit sophisticated pizzas going by their variety, offers, and prices. Though the outlet is adopting heavy promotional tactics by introducing their famous meal @129 bucks. I personally found nothing new in terms of flavours for their regular pizzas. Though the stuffed indianized pizzas are worth trying. Garlic bread tastes fresh and flavourful. Staff is helpful. However, an unemployed perennially broke and hungry student like me wouldn't be satisfied by just one slice, and buying more of them will burn a hole in my pocket. Therefore, wait for those few good days of the month and splurge! ;) RECOMMENDED: Stuffed pizzas",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Nikhil Chawla,Rated The new kid in the block for the pizza . I was here to meet their CEO Akhil and had a bite over the lunch ( that does not effect the rating of this review ) . Sbarro is a breath of fresh air and have a variety of pizza which are available in minutes . I tried few of them they were really nice and this place is added to our pizza hunt this year which will happen during the winter season . Also taste their chicken sausages red sauce pasta which taste nice . Nice and tangy sauce with good quality sausages .

We ordered the tomato basilico pasta and took two single slices of pizza - mixed veg & paneer. They have a live pasta counter and I think the pasta was the best of all dishes. Somehow the pizza wasnt able to impress - maybe for the size.. We just wanted to have more of the pasta. Plan to go back soon and try the white sauce pasta once. Looking forward. On my second visit had the white sauce pasta, another round of veg pizza and ended it with new york cheesecake. Loved the pasta , once again pizza din impress me much.

Manan Grover,"Rated For all those who loathe Pizza Hut and dominos and are apprehensive about shelling out money for the thin crusts in expensive restaurants/cafe, this place comes as a rescue. What to look out for:- 1. The Rs199 meal which offers any two pizza slices. This one fills your tummy completely. 2. The stuffed pepperoni and sausage pizza- a meat lovers fantasy. 3. The margarita pizza- it's light and delicious What to avoid:- 1. The stuffed paneer makhani pizza- kadhai paneer stuffed in your crust. 2. New York cheese cake. Sbarro is a must visit. The seating and ambience is good like any quick service restaurant. Once u enter the place, the sight of the freshly made pizzas and the aroma would re-affirm your decision.",Rated 4.5,1,45,??
Deepakshi Mahajan,"Rated The tempting look and the fragrance kept it on my list and finally i made it to this place. The size of the slice is enough to make u full, and helps avoid overeating, we ordered meat delight and pepperoni slices, both of them were juicy and the taste remained even when they were not as hot as they were served.

It is perfect for catching a quick bite while in CP. The Pasta is served with a delicious but a little dry garlic roll. The creamy texture was complemented by the right balance of spices. The slice of pizza was somewhat overpriced (120 bucks for a single slice- I know, right?) but there was no shortcoming in taste and texture. It was cheesy, had the perfectly crisp base and was loaded with veggies- just the way I like it.

They occupy two floors ground and the first. The interiors are good and it was very clean and the service was fast too. But i didnt like the pizzas.In the sausage and the jalapeno pizza the jalapeno tasted really bad as if they were really old. The chicken tikka pizza was average. The only pizza i liked was the pepproni pizza but it was too oily. They have three deals as well where you can chose from. Ordered the brownie as well again it was average.

Harshit Mahajan,"Rated Nicely located in central delhi. Ample of sitting space, but not well organized. The conditioning system is unevenly balanced. Initially, when we entered the music was nice, but as we were about to end our meal, I believe their playlist for the day was more than over. The menu has good variety to indulge. We tried our hands a pepperoni pizza and chicken tikka. Pepperoni was good, but the other one was dull. Something good was their cheese quality. Their garlic bread was so-so. It had full flavor of garlic as it was religiously dipped in the garlic and oil mixture, but we had a difficult time chewing it. I tried their newyork cheese cake. Something refreshing though. Also, if you are more of a pasta guy, try the Alfredo Parmesan. Overall it was a decent one time experience. The cost was fair: 300/- per person, and yes you get an opportunity to walk around in connaught place.",Rated 3.0,10,16,??

The place is not that great, the service is prettt good but the food, that's what it comes down to. The food is not worth the price. You have a 100 bucks and you are hungry.

We checked out the menu and were about to go for rs 99 value meal but the staff suggested to go for the 399 combo in which the topmost veg pizza could be selected to go with a brownie and coke and garlic bread. Panzer makhani stuffed pizza doesn't look so tempting from outside but deservingly it's the most sold pizza here, as told by one of the staff members who suggested to go for this one. Garlic bread needs improvement. Brownie was excellent. Great pricing and combo offers. But the USP is the staff attendees and behavior. The way they suggest and help is really good. Also this place works on the system of take food first and then pay. Something they say happens in America. Highly recommended place especially for those looking for a fresh outlet.

But here theyve tried to fulfill it by providing big pizzas. And to an extent it does work. But should have more cheese. More cheese filled inside it would have been awesome.

Deepti Kumra,"Rated Sbarro was recommended to me by my friend when I was absolutely clueless on where to go for a pocket friendly lunch in CP. So on this recommendation I visited this place and it was totally worth it. The interiors of sbarro are very contemporary and it looks like a fast food joint. What I liked was the levels they have. As soon as you enter the restaurant, the waiter gives a tray and asks you to start ordering by moving ahead in the row. The first is the pasta point. Then there is a pizza point where you can choose from a variety of pizzas on display. And further there is a counter for garlic breadsticks, brownies and beverages. At last you have to make the payment when your order is complete and find a seat. Sbarro has 2 floors and has a good seating space. 1 slice of Mushroom pizza (4/5): This pizza had toppings of mushroom, onion and black olives. I loved it! 1 slice of Chicken makhani (5/5): Please do not go on the looks of this pizza. It is a must have! The pizza looks absolutely plain from above but it has a thick crust and has chicken, cheese and many veggies stuffed in the crust which is absolutely delicious. Garlic breadsticks (4/5): the garlic breadsticks were again amazing! although they could have been a little more softer! Me and my friend had ordered a meal for 2 which included 2 slices of pizza, 2 garlic breadsticks, 1 brownie and 1 bottle of coke. Our bill came out to be 460rs which was very reasonable and the meal was completely filling! The quality of their food is amazing!

Do try the White Pizza....No tomato base, Ricotta and Mozzarella cheese and a mild herb sprinkle. Ricotta made such a mark on this one that it left me ignoring my all time favourite, Pepperoni.

The crust was very soft and fresh and the bread stick was also good. The drink(mango lemonade) was a bit disappointing. But the whole meal was value for money.

Amidst an array of colors and fragrance emanating from range of dishes, it is divine to have a meal there. Food- I ordered pasta and a slice of chicken tikka pizza. There were varieties of pizzas based on country's name. E.g. scotland pizza, zimbabwe pizza etc.The sight of live cooking of pasta takes hunger to another teasing level. While the pasta was reasonably good, not out of the world, the pizza was way beyond my expectation. Staff- staff was amicable and hospitable, this was certainly a cherry on the top. The billing is done after you have taken your food on plate ( but before having it). Finally, I would definitely like to try various other kinds of pizzas too.",Rated 4.0,29,289,??
Bhagyashree Nair,Rated This place serves the best chicken Alfredo pasta in the city. The chef made it right in front of me and added a few extra olives and parmesan cheese on top for me.

Arpit,"Rated Roaming in CP for eating something good suddenly this place caught my eyes 99 Rs combo offer. So we thought to give it a shot. I never heard it before or read. Ambiance : It was good as you enter large entrance gate. Then I saw the Kitchen of live concept and it was astounding, in front of you they are preparing food. I have watched in TV series only serving pizza like this it is different from your regular Pizza hut and Dominos. Serving a large single piece and preparing in front of you like saw in Friends series. Staff : The staff was friendly. There was a strong aroma of garlic as you enter in the restaurant. Food : We ordered one meal to try as we had already done our lunch. We took simple margherita pizza , garlic bread and mango lemonade. The bread was a little dry so it was little hard to eat. The Crust of pizza was good and it is full of cheese and the lemonade was normal. Overall : The place is nice , pizzas are good If you are a pizza lover must try this place.",Rated 3.5,47,803,??

Once you enter the place you tend to get a little confused about how to go with the order but, the staff is so damn friendly and helpful that everything instantly would become easy. The pizzas are delicious though, I wouldn't say the same for their garlic breads. I went with my friends and had quite a pleasant experience. They also gave us a complementary bat and ball per order (the ICC worldcup fever) and for that bat and ball I was sold! :P In short you surely should drop by this place if you like pizzas!",Rated 3.5,20,329,??
Rishnita Bhandari,"Rated My experience at Sbarro proved why it is famous for its range of Pizzas! Built in two floors, it has a light and pretty ambience having red, green, white and black as prime colors. Since we wanted variety, we ordered Pepperoni Pizza Slice, Supreme Pizza Slice and Chicken Makhani (Stuffed) Pizza Slice; Pepperoni and Supreme being with the Combo which includes Garlic Bread and a soft drink. Supreme (Rs. 119 for combo) seemed like a package. It had bits of chicken mince, pepperoni and mushroom along with usual pizza ingredients. Pepperoni Pizza (Rs. 119 for combo) had diced pepperoni with cheese, which made it simple yet desirable. Chicken Makhani stuffed pizza (Rs. 179) was my favorite of the day. Pizza dough stuffed with chicken minces, and curry. The seamless blend of most popular Indian curry flavors with spices gave the traditional taste an International name! Garlic Bread (part of the combo) was freshly baked with a light garnishing of chopped garlic pieces on the top. Watching your pasta made live makes your hunger go uncontrollable. Bolognaise Pasta (Rs. 179) is Sbarros speciality, made with meat sauce. I have had better pastas around. The staff is courteous, quick and really helping! They made our dilemma of which pizza to choose much easier. Sbarro has become one of my favorite at Connaught Place and I would definitely visit again for the lip smacking pizzas! rishnita.blogspot.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Mehar Diwan,"Rated Visited sbarro for the first time today after passing it by quite a few times. Absolutely bowled over. I believe they make their dough, which you can tell. Had the New York style pepperoni slice along with garlic bread and an iced tea and a massive slice of carrot cake. The pizza was packed with flavour and didn't have a doughy processed and greasy feel to it. The bread to cheese to sauce to meat ratio was perfection. The garlic bread, quite different from what one is used to, but delicious all the same. The carrot cake was lip smacking. All I wanted was to curl up with my plate of carrot cake and keep disappearing into oblivion with every bite. That being said I am going to visit this place until I've had my fair share of pizza and assorted toppings. Also looking forward to try out the cheesecake and the brownie.

Madhav Babbar,"Rated Sbarro is an American Food Chain that serves irresistible New York Style Pizzas. Location - It is in the much happening Inner Circle just a few steps from Domino's . Ambience-Simple and well-decorated interiors. Service - The only weak link in this fabulous place. The self service system is something that irritates me too much. Plus , the staff is themselves confused on the various combos & schemes. Food - Completely irresistible. We ordered the UAE mushroom pizza combo and Classic Cheese Pizza and it was fabulous. The Garlic Bread too was good except that it wasa little low on spices. They serve a dip in place of Tomato Sauce which was also noteworthy. Price - It is well priced considering the fame it has in the United States. The combos are a delight on the pocket . Overall , a MUST visit .

Pallavi Nagar,"Rated I went there with a friend early in the morning. A total disappointment.The garlic breads were so raw that they felt like dinner rolls..This is pizza gone gross, gone obese. The base has the weight and consistency of carpet underlay. And with the topping, the whole thing becomes gooey, gunky, squidgy, fatty and filling. And, to confess the ghastly truth, oddly addictive. It appealed to all my baser instincts, which are considerable. The supreme pizza had a wonderful array of toppings, but the base wasnt done properly. The worst of all was the chicken tikka. The pizza was cold and there were chicken bones in it. Apart from food everything else is excellent there. Service is prompt. Ambiance is excellent. But do not expect any authentic food there, go and try some regular dish. It took em around 20 minutes to prepare the pizza's..",Rated 2.0,4,46,??

Filling up oneself, or a meal for two would really not have a person thinking twice on the food going out of their budget. I have always managed to fill myself up more than I came for.

Neeru Singh,"Rated I feel Delhiites can never have enough of Pizza. In every nook and cranny of Delhi, there is a Pizzaholic dreaming about the aromas of this foreign import, that has become our very own. And trust Indians (especially Delhites), to love food and also unabashedly give it their own touch. So now with the ongoing World Cup, Sbarro has come up with the World Cup special Pizzas. To make the menu more interesting, they have divided the different flavours into Pool A and Pool B. The team behind Sbarro has successfully managed to club together the two greatest passions of Delhiites- Desi Food & Cricket. As we were very hungry, we took no more than a few minutes to decide what we wanted to eat. We ordered for: 1) A World Cup Meal Kit- 2 Pizza Slices, Garlic Bread, Chocolate brownie and Cold Drink (Rs 399) 2) Broccoli and Mushrooms Stromboli (Rs 149) 3) Sausage and Jalapeno Slice (Rs 139) In the world cup meal I opted for Chicken Makhni Pizza Slice - for India and Ham and Pineapple- for West Indies. The Chicken Makhni Pizza style was so desi that it felt like having a Chicken Makhni Curry with a naan. Its a generously stuffed Pizza and after every bite the awesome stuffing oozes out of the slice. The Connoisseurs might not reckon this as authentic, but it sure tastes heavenly. The spicy, tangy and cheesy taste makes this Pizza a winner. Ham and Pineapple was a wonderful delight. The highlight of the pizza was the smoked cheese that had a distinct flavour as against the sweet chunks of Pineapple. This pizza had a subtle taste and the thin crust base would undoubtedly be my favourite. The Sausages and Jalapeno pizza is spicy and meaty. The veggies and the thin crust add crunch to this flavourful pizza. Their Garlic bread is baked and then covered with melted butter and garlic. Its an unusual way of making garlic bread and I would any day prefer the conventional bread baking technique for tastier results. Lastly, we had the Broccoli and Mushrooms Stormboli. Stromboli is a turnover made from bread dough and filled with Italian Cheese and sausages/ salamis or veggies. The golden crust on top is sprinkled with sesame seeds. This dish is full of cheese, tastes pretty mild and somewhere lacks the punch that other dishes offer. The total bill for this meal was Rs 807, inclusive of all taxes.

Be it the open-style kitchen, spacious decor or large & filling pizza-slices, this place definitely gives a ""Hatke"" experience from the endless other pizza brands! Their set-up of a very warm staff and impeccable kitchen hygiene is highly commendable. We also got lucky by getting a Value Meal free because the Roulette game (with Cricket World Cup format) we played paused on India! It just set the tone for a cheery meal ahead. Coming to the food, Alfredo Parmesan pasta was deliciously creamy. The Paneer Makhni slice was a little bland, but the Paneer Supreme lived upto its name. Veggies delight was decent.

And yes THERE 2 FLOOR WHITE RESTAURANT WILL CATCH YOUR ATTENTION EASILY .. It's a beautiful place to look at and have amazing staff to deal with .. For those who haven't went there , let me explain the system .. In sbarro the ordering style is different .. like in Domino's and pizza hut you might order and sit on seat and wait for order to be placed .. Sbarro is one step ahead of all in system .. The time you enter , a person from the staff greets you a welcome and offers you a plate and you can now move in a que along with the kitchen .. OH YES KITCHEN .. its a open kitchen restaurant ( the newest concept of all).. and you can order the chef directly and tell them to add things as per you just like subway .. so the time you're done with having all the food you want on your plate .. you reach the billing counter and then billing gets done .. Have a seat in any of the two floors and enjoy food .. Food standards - Not the best but yes still good .. I like Domino's more because of extra cheese now but if you're not a cheese person sbarro will be great for you .. I didn't try chicken yet so can't comment on it ..

Abhinav U. Kashyap,"Rated Bumped into this place accidentally while hunting for a good place to sit and dine avoiding the usual Pizza Huts and KFCs. And this turned out to be a wonderful surprise! I was amazed to see how pizzas and pastas are prepared in front of us. You get the feeling of having the authentic Italian-American cuisine. Ordered Arrabbiata pasta (red sauce) which had a tangy flavour thanks to the real tomato sauce. Cooked with sweet corn, onion, bell pepper (red capsicum), capsicum and broccoli. Nothing's better to watch it getting made in front of you. Isn't that awesome? Serving pizzas in slices isn't very common yet. At least, I don't see this happening at a lot of places. Second thing that I ordered was Chicken Tikka Pizza (slice). Nothing out of the world but it was worth it. Garlic bread was served with both these dishes which tasted really nice. One thing that I liked the most was the tomato sauce which was freshly prepared instead of the regular ketchup. Price is a touch on the higher side when you compare it with the quantity of food. Not complaining but just want'em to be competitive. Overall, the place is nice and tidy. Well lit with nice background music. Not at all overcrowded which is unusual to see in a place like Connaught Place. May be because its yet to gain high levels of popularity . Friendly staff! Scores well on my list.",Rated 4.5,9,38,??

Nidhi Jha,"Rated The concept of serving Pizza per slice has been in India for a long time but it was never like this. To see your pizza and pasta in making from the scratch in front of u with fresh vegetables is a different feeling. The freshness and crunchiness of veggies can be felt with every bite of thin crust pizza. I got such a feeling when I had a pizza slice from Pizza Panini, which is Munich's most loved pizza stop. Moreover, it has very good service, chef will come to serve you on your table if anything is taking to much time. Siting place is quit decent. It like those quick bite places where you can go to have good food and conversation.

The ambience is decent. Speaking of flavors, the pan pizza was delicious and adequate in size (typical Sbarro). It tastes what it looks like. The Stromboli had great zeal, the way it was packaged.

I have to speciallymention that the staff here is extremely well trained. They greeted us well while entering and while we were thinking about which pasta to chose the chef helped us by asking us relevant questions. The food was looking delicious and that gave a hard time to select what to eat. We finally settled for a pizza combo. The stuffed paneer makhani pizza here is great in stuffing and taste. It is the first place I have visited where an Indian paneerflavouredpizza has been perfectly mastered. The spicy paneerpizza was good. The garlic bread was average. The combo also had brownie and coke. After eating all this we were so full that we couldn't have the pasta. The ambiance is really nice. The very fact that they have a clean, open kitchen speaks volumes about their hygiene. Overall, I loved it. Update: I happened to so this place for the second time in the same week. The Arabitapasta was awesome and it was really tangy and cooked in front of us. The veggie delight and new yorkcheese pizza were also awesome. Again, a wonderful experience.",Rated 4.5,194,845,??

Karan,"Rated A friend's friend had recommended this place & then zomato-ed about it. Ratings were good so decided to visit. The concept is somewhat different. Its not actually ""pre-pay"" like fast food chain outlets are & is not even ""post-pay"". Its in between the two.You go to the counter,ask him what you want,he prepares live & then you have to pay. The ambiance is nice, not too fancy & not too dull. The seating is good. Coning on to what we had, since we were 7 people, Ordered two Rs99 meals , one pasta meal plus another pasta & Veggie Supreme pizza & beverages included coke & sprite. The cheese slice in the meals were below average types. Normal cheese topping on the pizza base, hardly had any taste. Garlic bread sticks too were okay, quite different from the ones we get elsewhere. The delight of our visit was the veggie supreme pizza which was the only thing above average. White sauce pasta too was below average & red sauce pasta had too much corn but still it was better than white sauce. Overall 3 rating for the ambiance & the fact that its cheap.

Although it looks like we ordered a lot, but it was perfect for 3 people. The ambience was good, and the staff was also friendly. The best dish was the white pizza, which i ordered, filled with cheese and the amazing garlic bread. Really yummy. Also we got a cute teddy bear for ordering the 399 combo. :) Do go for it guys, if you are a pizza lover.

Sankalp Sharma,"Rated Sbarro is the newest addition to the long list of restaurants at cp and it is definitely worth it. We were craving for good pizza's and the regular joints weren't going to cut it. We reached there in the evening thus it was fairly empty. The ambiance is overwhelming with live kitchen and high stools, it's spread over 2 floors and we chose to be seated just beside the live kitchen. After taking a look around and figured out how to order , picking up a tray we first selected our pizza slices Stuffed paneer makhini and NY style cheese pizza meal. We couldn't even wait to get the billing counter and we were already drooling over the pizza. Self service makes it easy to get things done and our billing was quite fast. Both the slices were heavenly. Stuffed paneer makhini with a typical Indian makhini style paneer stuffed within two layers of pure ecstasy. Topped with cheese and basil,the thin crust of the cheese pizza was delicious. With still having craving for more we wanted to taste the pasta, we went to the live station and the cook helped us chose our pasta according to our taste. With tomato basilica pasta being prepared we waited eagerly. Mushrooms , corn and penne pasta cooked to perfection with freshly made sauce, the aroma was enticing.

Vaishnavi Venkat,"Rated An interesting place that offers wide range of pizzas and pastas.I was with a friend and he suggested that I'll love the place. We ordered their Veggie Delight and Chicken Makhani slice meal. The pizza was really good and freshly made.They were extremely generous with their toppings and that is a great plus point. We were grateful that we ordered just their slice meal.One slice is enough for a person and is extremely filling. Okay so now the negatives. The garlic bread/roll offered with the meal was just disappointing. It was burnt and tasteless. The dessert which was a chocolate cake was pretty decent. But by the time we finished our pizza, the dessert had turned cold and we couldn't eat it Secondly, their service is something they need to work on. we wanted some extra spoons and glasses but there was nobody to help us.The staff was there but just not in a mood to help, it seemed. Also, while placing our order they forced us to opt for the love box which would give us some discount and a pink teddy bear.It was a little annoying because both of us were not interested in getting that.It's a not a question of whether people who are dating should get that box or not.It's just about my choice and were just not interested in getting one.But the staff kept insisting which was a little weird. Other than this, sbbaro is a great place to have some good pizza and definitely gives us a good break from Pizza hut and Dominos",Rated 3.5,36,179,??
Isha Saxena,"Rated Sbarro adds another golden star to the hall of fame of CP eateries. High ceiling with the classic white and red decor spread over two floors, it emits a sense of effortless charm. The much needed break from red brick walls, the place stands tall with the clean and minimal white brick walls and magnanimous monochrome pictures. I love attention to detail, and the fact that the red chairs had a pizza slice cut into them was very impressive again. We chose to sit downstairs where all the action was contained. The spik and span live kitchen where the delectable treats were being prepared casting out mouth watering aromas was a treat to the senses. They have a display of all the pizza slices and breads to choose from which constitute the menu of the day. The general idea is you pick up a tray, choose what you want pasta or pizza, wait for your order and then get the billing done. The only flaw I found was this setup, as till the time we got our billing done, the pizza had gone slightly cold. We ordered a slice deal, a stuffed pizza paneer makhni and later on a veg basilico. Both the pizzas were absolutely palatable. The fresh tomato base with melt in your mouth cheese, amongst the best margherittas I have had. The garlic bread roll was very novel and I really liked the concept of it though it could have been slightly softer. The stuffed pizza was ambrossial, sesame seed sprinkled over and the very Indian paneer makhni stuffed inside. Yumm! A special mention to the fresh and tantalizing tomato sauce! (Y) They have a live pasta station where we watched earnestly as the pasta was tossed to perfection! The slightly smoky tomato zest with dollops of sweetcorn, mushrooms topped with fresh parmesean. The pasta was slightly overdone but we enjoyed it thoroughly nonetheless. Can't wait to go back and try the Stromboli.

As it was my first visit and there were hardly any customers in there I didn't wanted to take risk by ordering anything else.

Fresh Lime Soda,"Rated When I stepped into Sbarro, Connaught Place, the latest Sbarro outlet in town, all I was expecting was the usual Italian fare. But if I say that I was surprised, it'll be an understatement. For the record, Sbarro is known worldwide for high quality fresh handmade products, fast speed of service, value for money and wide variety of 17 extra large New York style pizzas cut into large slices. Naturally, expectations were pretty high. A quick chat with the chef, Rahul, delighted me with options that I couldn't wait to taste. Of all the options served to me, Pepperoni, stole my heart. A sumptuous slice, with an edge-to-edge topping of Pork Pepperoni, has a flavour that was absolutely adored by my taste buds. Fresh pork, fresher dough and melt-in-mouth cheese. In fact till the last bite, it was simply un-put-down-able. Go for it. Next, I decided to sink my teeth into a slice of White. A slice with Ricotta and Mozzarella, had an equally delightful flavour. Here, the flavour of fresh dough was relished even more. Recommended by Rahul, and loved by me. Though, we were pretty much full, still greed had the better of us. So, opted for the next in line. Chicken Makhani. Presumably, this west-meets-east pizza is an addition to the menu to pamper the Indian palate. Thick stuffing of tangy chicken with peppers, its topping has a generous sprinkling of onion slices. Indian to the last morsel, this slice was litttle on the heavier side. Strictly for those who like their western recipes with an Indian twist. While I was wondering the secret behind the delectable flavours of the pizzas, Rahul enlightened me. The dough, sauce and cheese is freshly made at Sbarro outlets by highly trained chefs. All in an effort to help you relish the flavour of freshness. And I was quite impressed by the garlic and herbs dip served with the garlic breads. Finally, it was time for a sweet ending. So, we decided to go with the New York Cheesecake. Nothing out of the world yet satisfies the sweet craving. In just two words, safe bet. Here, I would like to shed some light on a few areas that needs a bit of attention. The ambience needs to be a little more New York. After all, it isnt fun to devour the recipes of a certain place without the feel of that particular place. Maybe, Sbarro needs to fix a few petty things, when it comes to the seating comfort and cleanliness. Because a potruding nail next to the chair can be quite a turn off. Maybe these are teething issues that will be well taken care of in no time. Overall, go for the pizzas in a new avatar. sweetfreshlimesoda.blogspot.com",Rated 4.0,42,446,??

Samyak Ranjan,"Rated Sbarro is nice and I am just amazed everytime I go there.They have interesting offers going on and their 99 meal is I think one of the most sold items being cheap and having a combo of a pizza slice, garlic bread and a drink. The general idea is, you order from the pizza counter and then take your meal to the payment counter to pay the bill. Then you head on to your table to devour it. The pizza slice in the combo is plain cheese pizza. I never order plain margherita or cheese pizza's if I'm ordering anywhere since I like some vegetables or anything more than just plain cheese on my pizza. But here, I didn't feel that need. The slice was amazing and delicious. The outer crust was perfectly crisp and the accompanying sauce with the garlic bread worked well with the pizza slice too!The garlic bread was also one of the better ones I've had in Delhi.So it was a perfect combo meal with a pocket friendly price for the students.

He recommended a garden salad with ham which I declined politely. Next I asked the chef to customise Spaghetti Alfredo by creating a mix of red and white sauce. He agreed to do this instantly and asked me to watch him as he placed a pan on the induction plate. The pasta was fine.

Ic30,Rated Great great pizza. Great quality cheese and sauces. Value for money. Refreshing food unlike the regular pizza which can get heavy. Good crunchy and buttery garlic bread and fresh tomato sauce San Marzano style. Well done crust. A thumbs up!,Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Soumel,"Rated Enter Sbarro and you are greeted with the aroma from the freshly baked pizzas (and their huge size!) . The concept implemented here is a bit different as first you have to collect your order n then pay for it (self service). The pizza's are good... Especially the stuffed ones (I tried veggie extravaganza). Now, the pasta... Well that was a whole different story... Oily, saltless, flavourless. Some might find salt to be less even in pizzas.. But I found it perfect to my taste. Overall doesn't hurt to try it n it won't burn a hole in your wallet. :p",Rated 3.5,2,9,??
Raunaq Kalia,"Rated Loved the pizza. The base was light, thin and very fresh. We ordered the full Spicy Paneer NY style pizza. They were very generous with the toppings and the flavors were bang on. Much better than the Dominos, Chicago Pizza and PH pizzas. Would've given it a 4 easily, if it were not for the annoying self service style where you collect your food first and then pay. In a crowded outlet in CP, this can turn out be a total pain.",Rated 3.5,44,270,??
Shriya Chadha,"Rated Strolling in CP, me and my friends came across Sbarro. We went inside and we were overwhelmed to see the variety of pizzas and salads over there. We ordered margerita pizza and white pizza. Both of them were really nice and diffrent from usual pizzas. They had an italian touch to it which tickeled my taste buds. We also ordered ceasar salad, it was okay. And we ordered white sauce pasta. It was creamy n full of mushrooms. The garlic bread which was served with pasta was great. It is a very pocket friendly place. I recommend this place to all the pizza lovers.",Rated 4.0,20,119,??
Devansh Gilani,"Rated Well I have been away from past 2 and a half month and now I see a bunch of new places to eat in the heart of delhi, a good sign of spreading the happiness by feeding people some good food. :) ;) A recent visit to this place made me write about my experience about the restaurant. Sbarro, serving slices of huge pizzas turned out to be a good deal for us, where we managed to get a different taste of pizza that dominoes and pizza hut has to offer. They have value meals which include a stick of garlic bread and one beverage, the garlic bread tasted good and was fresh. Talking about the pizza slices we got ourselves paneer tikka pizza and veggies extravaganza. Paneer tikka was good enough for one person and tasted decent. Veggies extravaganza was a stuffed pizza which was covered with the dough and then baked, it was good but it didn't have proper seasoning in it. The place was clean and the decor was bright and welcoming, the staff behaved nicely with the customers with patience. I just hope they make a token system cuz you will have to be in a line and wait for your order in the line itself to get your order and then you are directed to the payment counter. The prices are fine..could be a little lower to give a tough fight to the pizza competitors. Overall rating... Food- 4/5 Ambiance- 3.5/5 Value for money- 3.5/5",Rated 4.0,67,167,??
Atul Ranjan,"Rated So after having a good experience in Gurgaon outlet, I visited the Sbarro outlet at CP. So this outlet is slightly bigger than the Gurgaon. CP outlet is similar both in terms of service and food quality. Overall Sbarro offers good quality food at affordable price.",Rated 4.0,22,46,??
Shubhodeep Pal,Rated If you love pizzas and pastas (New York Style) then you'll be thrilled with the Sbarro outlet recently opened at CP. I loved the stuffed pizza I had -- Chicken Makhani -- which brings me to the fact that this is possibly one of those rare places that does Indian/Italian fusion well. The pasta is quite decent too -- it's a rare delight to see the chef not skimp on the veggies. You will be quite surprised to know that a filling meal for two (including dessert) will easily fall within the 500-700 range!,Rated 4.5,35,75,??
Shramikaahluwalia,Rated I happened to visit this pizza parlour #sbarro this evenng in c.p block N . U kno the staff is courteous right when u enter the outlet ... they welcome u wid a greeting and waving and smiling at u from their open kitchen . U can choose ur pasta n pizza from the desk n place your order . u may choose to order a pizza or slices with different toppings . The menu is written as well as the dishes are kept for display for you to choose . Paneermakhani might catch your attention but i do not recommend it . It tastes more lyk a sandwich or footlong than a pizza . Go for classic margharitta or any other pizza as you wish . The only thing that irked me was that they did not have a few pizzaz available which were on the menu and that made my choice limited to what was there at the display . Also they need to work on their pasta .. it was jus average and sadly the worst pasta i've had in months . U pay after placing and getting your order ready . We paid 500 for a pasta and 2 pizza slices from the vegetarian menu which is quite reasonable because the slices r really huge and the quantity of pasta is sufficient . The taste is gud nothin extraordinary. .. 3.5 from me !!!,Rated 3.5,3,2,??
Vishal Verma,"Rated You will find one of the finest pizzas #sbarro. Ordered slice of new stuff pizza, two slices of this pizza is enough for your tummy to be quiet for atleast half day.

Aanchal Goel,Rated Paneer makhni pizza . Not good at all. Took it because of the look but the looks did not justified the makhni taste. It's more of a Kulcha rather than a pizza. 3 stars are for the friendly staff out there.,Rated 3.0,38,204,??
Mohini,"Rated steer clear unless low on cash is all i can say of this place! i went here only because of the great reviews i read online and i have to say i was mislead. first of all i cudnt beilve that the pizzas were already made ( they just heat it up before serving ) and kept on display, without even any form of covering! immediately my mind went to the hygiene factor , but ignoring all my instincts i went ahead and tried the new york style cheese slice. what a huge disappointment! the slice was cold , soggy, the tomato sauce in the base was tasteless and the cheese stringy. i dont know about most people but my idea of the perfect pizza would definitely be piping hot, exuding the yeasty fragrance associated with pizzas and freshly baked with melted cheese. this pizza had none of that( and it was supposed to be their signature pizza) so i dread to think about the other variations. the only thing positive about this place was the cost of the food and the quick service( not hard if pizzas are already made..haha) all i can say is .. if you are in this area and want a pizza, then plz head to the superawesome Chicago Pizza nearby in block A.",Rated 3.0,72,45,??
Joel George,"Rated finally... sbarro's ..!! I first visited their nehru place outlet a few yrs back when they had just entered the market and i was blown away by how good they were.

What a wonderful expereince.. delightful courteous staff, great food, and unbelievable portions..! their pizzas are simply one of the best ive had.. if you love your pizzas, and you wanna try something not dominos or pizza hut, then sbarro's is where you need t come.. papa johns is the other grt chouce, but thats for another review.. this place is grt.. stop reading reviews - just go!! and have their signature cheese pizza...!! :) cheers...",Rated 5.0,59,439,??
Asha Jose,"Rated Lemme start by saying that I have found the best pizza available in Delhi!!! I visited Sbarro with a friend hoping to have a medium bite, and trying to relive some older memories we have of this place. It is conveniently located in inner circle near vault cafe. We ordered a slice of the new York white cheese pizza and one of the new York chicken tikka pizza...and man were both our pizzas delicious. Our bill came to 250 bucks! The NY white pizza is a heavenly delight for all cheese lovers. I must mention that the staff was extremely courteous and pleasant. They greeted us very well and were always smiling. Will definitely visit Sbarro again to try out their stuffed pizzas and live pasta station...",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Gargi Singh,"Rated After being disappointed with the rush at Burger King even on weekday, I stumbled upon Sbarro. When I entered, I was greeted by everyone behind the counter because the restaurant was all empty :P. However in few minutes people started coming in which made me a little comfortable. The place has a self service where u pick up a tray and go to the concerned counter. I opted for the non veg combo which comprised of one slice of chicken tikka pizza, garlic bread and cold drink. As much as I enjoyed the pizza, the garlic bread was a bummer. It was very dry, not quite soft and I had to gulp it down somehow. The red chutney or ketchup didn't help either. The meal cost me a little above 200. I would love to explore the place but steer clear of the garlic bread!",Rated 3.5,33,80,??

Shweta Aggarwal,"Rated My first experience with Sbarro wasnt great but this one was a bit satisfactory. This outlet is quite lively with a great location. Theyve really good value meals. I ordered a Pasta Value Meal and a Slice Value Meal. Both the meals were really fulfilling in terms of taste and quantity. One thing which irritated me was their self-service. Theyve a live paste counter and youve to take a tray and stand in a line to take your order and till the time you get everything in your tray your food turns cold, it feels like that youre standing in a canteen. Theyve a good music and very courteous and enthusiastic staff. You can make a visit and decide yourself. thefoodiefling.blogspot.com",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Smriti Jain,"Rated Two days since it made a debut in Delhi, this place is bustling with so much vibrancy and oh the English classics playing in the background, just what was needed. The interiors are minimal and it gives a very regular feel of any other pizza joint until one comes across their open kitchen concept with some very delectable choices on the menu and a wide range display of pizzas leaving you in a state of dilemma. The value meals offered are very economical and I decided to try one myself. The pasta value meal has a choice of varied pastas and sauces combinations to choose from. Alfredo Parmesan is what ticked my taste buds and was accompanied by a salad, garlic bread and a choice of beverage. The pasta was delicious indeed and the quantity is just about right. The consistency of white sauce and the Italian herbs was perfectly balanced. Next came the New York Cheese Slice Pizza, albeit I had very high hopes for this one but it was nothing out of the ordinary. I would rather recommend to try other toppings instead, like ham and pineapple or stuffed vegetable pizza which looked very appetising. Damages-Around 600 for two with two value pasta meals and one New York slice cheese pizza.",Rated 3.5,2,78,??
Nidhi Kapur,"Rated Good ambiance, great hospitality, awesome food speci ally because you can customize it. We had New York style cheese pizza which had mozzarella with 100% whole milk, chicken stuffed pizza which was Indianized and was mouth watering. Red and white sauce pasta was also lip smacking. Irresistible frosted carrot cake. On the top of everything, the staff was enthusiastic and smiling. Although it was a sponsored dine out but the opinion is impartial. This is a must visit Sbarro outlet",Rated 4.5,44,389,??
