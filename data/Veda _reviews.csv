Manavv Piplani (Bribing Stomach),"Rated This place is in outer circle cp for over a decade. I have crossed it for like million times and have heard alot of positive things about this place. So,I decided to visit there with family and we felt amazing as soon as we entered the place. Interiors are done by Rohit Bal, it was quite impressive and it shows in its work why he is one of the top designers of our country. The use or mirrors,huge chandelier in the middle and king size chairs with candles on tables and dim light gives you the feel of eating like a royal people. We started with some drinks, Apple Cinnamon Mojito,one of the most amazing mocktails I had in a long time and ordered it twice. Apple's major taste with a pinch of Cinnamon. In starters, Nitrogen Spinach Chaat,some chemistry and you get an innovative dish, spinach crisped in nitrogen then sweetened yogurt poured in nitrogen which end up creating crumble of yogurt and served with tamarind and mint sauce. Dahi ke kabab was so filling and delicious,so soft that it melted as soon as you take a bite. Murg Tikka fondue,tikka presented in tandoor type vessel served with its marinated mixture of spices and cream as fondue. Lamb Seekh Kabab was very soft and nicely cooked has all the flavors and was not at all over or under cooked. In mains, Paneer Kundan Kaliya, somethings was different than shahi paneer. It has cheese and pepper to taste different in a good way. Kurkuri Bhedi was crispy as it should be and thin as paper. A very good recommendations. For Deserts, Litchi Ki Tehri, it was amazing and have heard alot about this tasty thing but you have to experience it yourself to get the heavenly taste. Amazing! The service was excellent and really made us feel like home, Served us with smile and patiently described all the dishes and recommend us the best they have. Worth going and you will be highly satisfied for sure.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Dhrupad Suri,"Rated Veda is an amazing fine dining option in one of the most bustling foodie destinations of Delhi. At first I thought that it only serves Vegetarian Food (Going by the name) We ordered for a Veda Spinach Chaat & Kakori Kebab from the Appetisers. Since the appetisers were satiating we went on to the desserts directly and ordered for a Kulfi & Kesari Phirni. The Kakori was the show stealer since I'm a non vegetarian person, thought I've never had this amazing a ""Palak Patta Chaat"". At the end of the meal we were really content and satisfied with all parameters of dining at this restaurant.

Pragya Abrol,"Rated AMBIENCE - 5/5 TASTE - 4.5/5 SERVICE - 4.5/5 This a very late review but I remember every bit of my experience at Veda pretty well because it was simply magnificent! Starting with the decor its done by Rohit Bal so obviously there was no chance it could have disappointed me . The place is just beautiful, the interiors are one thing I couldnt take my eyes of throughout my visit! Talking about the food, it was so rich and flavourful that I just didnt want to stop. In the starters we had kakori kabab,malai broccoli,hara kabab and fish amritsari. For the main course we ordered makhini chicken, kdhai prawn and dal veda with assorted breads that included butter naan and laccha prantha. Also we had asparagus soup and to satisfy our sweet tooth we went for a lichi kheer. The starters were one of the best I have ever had, from the veg ones to the non veg ones all were so delectable. The .5 I have cut here are because of the main course, I expected veda dal to be special but it was nothing like that. It was like the usual dal makhini thats available at other restaurants. Also the makhini chicken wasnt something I would order again, it was ok ok. The prawns were without a doubt amazing. Asparagus soup was very different and fresh, lichi kheer was another star dish here. In all you can't miss on this one, the place is bombarded with great food and ambience. surely a place you shouldnt miss upon!

Neelaakshi Piplani,"Rated Veda, which recently completed 10 glorious years located in the heart of Delhi whose interiors have been crafted by the well known designer Rohit Bal. The choice of artifacts, mirrors, colors, candle stands, cutlery reflects sheer sophistication and royalty. The decor of the place is just perfect for a candlelight romantic dinner or for celebration of a family occasion. The restaurant serves Amuse Bouche which means a complementary small appetizer which was a pudina mater galouti. Loved it totally! We tried Apple Cinnamon mojito, California Chi Chi which was a mix of peach apricot and cranberry. Chilly coriander martini was indeed a refresher and out of the box kinda mock-tail. The starters menu had a lot of healthy options like Tandoori Malai Broccoli which was innovative as well as tasty. Dahi Ke Kebab were one of the best served in Delhi/NCR. It was exceptionally Soft and delicate. Paneer on Fire which was similar to Chilly paneer was just decent. Chicken Tikka Fondue, served in a round matka on tandoor sticks with the marination as a topping, is a fabulous dish with the perfect proportion of spices and cream. Do order the molecular Chaat- Veda spinach chaat which is a delicacy prepared with crispy spinach leaves and yogurt granules at a temperature of -165 degrees topped with bhalla, imly and mint dip garnished with sev and pomegranate seeds. From the mains we ordered Daal Veda, Paneer Kundan Kaliyan and Crispy bhindi. All three were absolutely perfect in terms of presentation, portions and quality. The Veg Biryani accompanied with a creamy raita was another lovely dish which all of us enjoyed. The desserts were appealing- Litchi Ki Tehri which was a blend of litchis and Rabri presented in a cocktail glass. The Shahi Tukda is a delight to have, especially if you are fond of Indian sweets. Mr Aman Sahani deserves a mention, one of the finest host I have met till date. Manger Amit and our server Roshan both were on the top of service. Kudos Team Veda!!

The Feast That's Life,"Rated While many eateries are delving into fusion Indian food, Veda, a decade old restaurant in CP, has stuck to what it does best- typical rich north Indian food. A fine-dining restaurant, boasting of interiors designed by Rohit Bal, the place has a regal feel to it, with dim lights, red chandeliers and countless mirrors. The dcor is quite over-the-top, and it really feels like youre dining in a palace. Though its not too big on space, the place is still warm and welcoming. We started our meal with: Veda Spinach Chaat: This is the typical street chaat of battered and fried spinach leaves, topped with sweetened yogurt, tamarind and mint sauce, but could have done with a bit less sev on top. It serves as a nice bite to get your juices flowing for the meal ahead. Dahi Kebab: The dahi kebab had a thin crispy coating and was extremely smooth and creamy inside, with a lovely sour flavour from the dahi. However, it was a bit too strong on the cardamom, which overpowered the subtle flavours of the kebab. Hara Kebab Chaat: This was a really innovative take on the regular hara bhara kebabs, as they were converted into a chaat by topping it with yogurt, mint sauce and tamarind. A really interesting and different dish. Manchurian Cauliflower: Fried, crunchy cauliflower florets coated with a Manchurian gravy. A nice dish, but the Manchurian sauce could have been a touch less sweet. Malai Broccoli: It had broccoli marinated with a creamy sauce, topped with cheese and baked. A really beautiful dish, something that even broccoli-haters might like. Kakori Kebab: These kebabs were perhaps the best of the lot. The meat was minced really finely and the kebabs were really smooth and melt-in-the-mouth. They were delicately flavoured with cloves and garlic, while still letting the taste of the meat shine. Chicken Lahsooni and Chicken Malai tikka with Fondue Sauce: The tikkas were presented in skewers in a copper vessel, along with a creamy sauce served fondue-style. Not only was this a very unique presentation, but dipping the chicken tikka in the sauce imparted extra flavour and moistness to the chicken. For mains, we tried: Veda Dum Aloo: The dish consisted of whole potatoes stuffed with onions, cashews and spices, in a creamy and rich gravy. Though they were nice, there was nothing extraordinary about them. Paneer Kundan Kaliyan: Battered, spiced and fried paneer in a typical makhani gravy. The paneer, by virtue of being well-marinated, was not bland and the gravy had the creamy texture and flavour we associate with makhani gravies. Dal Veda: The dal was simply delicious. It was thick and creamy, and it came through that it had been cooked over slow fire for a long time to develop those deep flavours. Crispy Masala Okra: Another stellar dish from the Veda kitchen- perfectly crispy (without being oily) paper-thin okra, with just a touch of masala, and some red onions and tomatoes- a perfect little snack to go with all these rich gravies. Shahi Chicken Korma: The chicken was cooked perfectly and the gravy was subtly spiced and home-style. This was a delicate and flavourful dish and if youre not looking for something heavy, then this should definitely be tried. Mutton Keema: Juicy mutton keema, not too heavily spiced so that one could actually taste the keema. The meat was well cooked and ground to the perfect consistency so that it retained a grainy texture, which was just great. Vegetable Biryani with Burani Raita: Though Im personally not a fan of veg biryanis, this one was quite well made. The vegetables were cooked al dente, and each grain of rice was separate. Spices were added with a light hand, so that the flavour of the rice and veggies could shine. Along with the garlic-flavoured raita, this was a pretty good biryani. We had these dishes with some tandoori rotis and stuffed onion kulchas, both of which were quite thick and lacked crispness, so perhaps they can work on their breads. We also tasted a couple of drinks: Apple Cinnamon Mint Margarita: A beautiful concoction of apples, mint and cardamom, this was a refreshing drink and was not too sweet. Rose and Cardamom Lassi: This served as a nice palate cleanser between our starters and main course. The lassi was light on sugar, and had a lovely flavour of cardamom and rose. We ended our meal with a dessert-Litchi ki Tehri: The dessert was served in a tall glass and had a scrumptious saffron rabdi which was thick and creamy, topped with litchi pieces. A really nice way to end a decadent meal. Overall, it was a lavish meal of traditional North Indian dishes, with their authenticity intact and their flavours pronounced. The royal dcor of the place also sets it apart. Veda can surely be visited for a rich and satisfying meal.

Bhawna Pathak,"Rated Veda is a perfect place for fine dine experience. I visited this resto bar for the first time for bloggers meet organised by Dilsefoodie on the occassion of its 10th Anniversary. Everything was so perfect about this place. I am in love with this place. Veda's interiors is entirely done by India's top leading designer Mr. Rohit Bal. What a mesmerising decor. I was totally awestruck. Giant mirrors, chandeliers, and vintage lamps were all around. This place is perfect for romantic date. Dim red lighting and also the soft melodious song played in the background was highly appreciated. Excellent detailings was done. Now lets come to the food. I tried several cocktails and mocktails. They tastes amazing. Apple and cinnamon iced tea with the hint of vodka was the best. In starters, I tried pudine mutter ki galuoti topped with philadephia cheese. Absolutely stunning in taste as well as in presentation. Cheese stuffed broccoli was out of the world. Murg malai chicken tikka with cheese fondue was my favourite among all. This is the best dish I've had in a recent times. Rann with mint dip was tender, succulent and flavorful. Lamb seekh kebab was wonderful too. Kadai chilli paneer was yummy. Asparagus soup was bang on. Starters are very delicious over here. In Main course, I had Veda dal, it was delectable and lip-smacking. Mutton Biryani was flavorful and rich in flavors. Paneer Makhni, Gravy Mutton, Nihari, Veda Dum Aloo, Chicken Shahi Korma, Kadai Prawns and assorted breads were good enough. Absolutely stunning. For dessert, I tried their very own Lichi Ki Tehri, it was heavenly. Simply loved it. Overall, An excellent place which serves North Indian And Mughlai delicacies. Service was quick and prompt.

Siddhant Joshi,"Rated Veda is famous for its Dim light and Mirror Decoration. I've been to Veda Kolkata several times which was pathetic Service and Food both wise but Visiting Delhi's Veda changed my Perception. The food quality was good and taste was fine. It was a lunch so we ordered Paneer khurcha, Veda Aloo Dum, Yellow Dal, Paneer Kulcha, Missi Roti, Rumali Roti and Sodas. Starting with Aloo Dum which was great except the gravy in which there was something jeera type which spoiled the taste otherwise it was delicious. Paneer Kurcha was good the paneer was soft, Dal was fine I wanted to try Veda Dal (kali) but people with me wanted to eat YELLOW DAL. Now comes to service after we entered we sat for 10mins to place the order when the restaurant was Empty which was a negative point. Waiters must have approached as soon as we took our table.

Went their with a friend of mine, as she was American she wanted to taste good Indian food and we decided to land up at Veda. Firstly the place is peaceful with decent crowd. We were welcomed and seated comfortably, then we ordered the typical Indian dinner with as usual dal makhani. One word ""out of the world"".

Mohit Anand,"Rated Veda : Just like the name, this restaurant is classy as ever. The restaurant is not very big in size but offers you an elegance ambience which would be hard to forget. I visited this place for my first candlelight dinner experience and I must say my choice was right. The place was full of foreigners when we visited it and the whole aura was breath taking. Virgini Strawberry Margarita was simply amazing and quenched our thirst appropriately. Veda spinach chaat, paneer khurchan, rumal roti, butter naan were the dishes which we tried and every one of them was lip smacking. We got some of the items packed at the end and their packing was also upto the mark. Some complaints : They didn't asked us our choice to take regular water or mineral water, Instead they just put a bottle of mineral water at our table. In the bill, they charged us more than the MRP of that bottle which is cheating according to the consumer law, kindly take a note of this incidence and change your process accordingly. Secondly, we ordered only one rumali roti but they brought us two, we thought that they offer two as a pair but eventually we were billed for two of them. The total experience at this place was wonderful which is why I didn't raised these issues at that moment.",Rated 4.0,96,679,??

Rahul Prabhakar,"Rated For a food connoisseur like me, a restaurant visit is no longer restricted to food only. I look for the complete experience - from ambiance to decor, from lighting to seating, from staff to service, from presentation to quality - everything has got to click! A foodie who spends a significant amount of time and money on great dining options doesn't want to settle down for anything less. Wifey also believes in being pampered. For a lot of folks like us, dining out is all about a great experience! When it comes to upscale, fine-dining options in Delhi, most brands sell themselves in the name of global cuisine and internationalized interiors. Only a few manage to truly impress! This weekend I stumbled upon a Pan-Indian restaurant by the name of Veda, a decade old leader in fine-dining. Situated in one of the busiest corners of Delhi, this property literally took me by surprise. To say that I had a fairytale like experience would not be an exaggeration. From the moment you enter Veda, it feels as if you're being transported to a royal court from a bygone era. The kinds you've seen in flicks like Mughal-e-Azam. What makes this lounge unique, and in many ways exceptional, is the level of detailing that has gone into the making. Exquisitely ornate interiors bear resemblance to Arabian Nights. Rich-red brick walls, carefully arranged backlit mirrors, dim lighting, and flickering shadows from low intensity chandeliers create an experience like no other. Reminiscent of a forgotten era, Veda sizzles and shimmers in true beauty. Thanks to ace designer, Rohit Bal, Veda continues to impress with its opulent designs and magnificent interiors. As I tried to pull myself together, I was warmly greeted by one of their staff who also escorted me to a reserved table for two. From pulling my chair to arranging the cutlery, this man continued to service for the entire duration of my stay there. Later I was joined by Mr. Aman Sahani, who is the general manager - operations at Veda. Aman provided valuable insights on Veda's cuisine, which is a contemporary twist on classic Indian cooking. If you're a sucker for utterly authentic Mughlai and North Indian cuisine, Veda is the place you should be headed to. What Works Amuse Bouche This single, bite-sized hors d'oeuvre was not accompanied by a complementing wine, but still offered a glimpse into the chef's approach to the art of Indian cuisine. A perfect mouth amuser, this dish in essence is ""Pudine Mutter Ki Galouti"" served with Philadelphia Cheese. Asparagus Shorba We all know that Asparagus is considered one of the world's healthiest foods and a delicacy since ancient times. In fact the fleshy green spears of asparagus are known to be both succulent and tender. Asparagus Shorba is essentially a creamy soup made out of Asparagus. Smooth and delicious, this soup is served hot in a traditional handleless terracotta cup called Kulhar. Drinks I instantly fell in love with the Chili Coriander Martini, a signature cocktail comprising vodka with basil, pepper, lemon juice, and pounded chilis. Left more than a tingle on my lips. Other personal favorite was the Apple and Cinnamon Mojito. Made of apple chunks, lime, fresh mint, and cinnamon simple syrup, the Apple and Cinnamon Mojito recreated the spirit of summer through the spices of fall. Wifey couldn't stop raving about All Of Me Californian Chi-Chi, which is essentially a Lychee drink with peach and apricot syrup. The slush is made of cranberry. Add vodka and you have a near perfect cocktail at hand. Starters - Vegetarian Taking the concept of Molecular Gastronomy a tad higher, Veda introduces a sumptuous Nitrogen Palak Patta Chat. Imagine savoring Nitrogen treated spinach and curd, frozen at minus 160 degrees. Here's a video snippet that shows perfectly how it is made. Dahi Ke Kebab Made of Greek yogurt (hung curd) and dry fruits, these mouth-watering kebabs had a soft texture and were quite easy on the palate. Perfectly cooked and balanced in taste, Dahi Ke Kebab must be consumed with green mint chutney only. One bite and you'll be craving for more. Malai Broccoli This one was not perfectly cooked yet managed to score brownie points for its heavy malai dressing. Paneer on Fire Served in a black circular deep cooking-pot called kadhai, this dish comprises cottage cheese, bell peppers, and onions. The unique thing about this dish is the flavor of ketchup, which I couldn't stop admiring. Non-vegetarian There are a plenty of options to drool over if you're a non-vegetarian. Murg Malai Tikka Fondue Served in a traditional Copper Table Service Tandoor, this dish comprises soft, well cooked chicken tikkas. Lending a fusion flavor is the rich, creamy molten cheese fondue. Lamb Seekh Kebab This flavorsome Indian lamb mince kebab is soft, seasoned, and authentic. Served with green coriander chutney, this highly recommended dish has a potent taste of garlic, ginger, and chili. It'll remind you of just one word - perfection. Lahsooni Fish Tikka Served with mint chutney, this soft and tender fresh fish tikka is prepared in special achari marination. Main Course - Vegetarian Some of my favorite dishes from the main course - vegetarian are listed below: Paneer Kundan Kaliyan - served with pepper, onions, and cheese. Veda Dum Aloo - whole stuffed potatoes served with onions and cashew. Daal Veda - black daal cooked overnight with cream. Vegetable Biryani - served with raita. Main Course - Non-vegetarian Some of my favorite dishes from the main course - non-vegetarian are listed below: Chicken Shahi Korma - cooked in Royal Mughal sauce. Nihari - morsels braised with saffron and whole spices. Kadai Prawns - stir fried with assorted vegetables. Lamb Biryani - served with raita. Dessert Litchi Ki Tehri Prepared with shahi litchis and sultanas, Litchi ki Tehri is essentially rabdi with a twist. Must applaud Chef Amit Shah for preparing a unique delectable dessert that leverages milk reduced in a kadhai. What Doesn't Work Having to consume assorted breads at Veda was a real bummer. But thankfully that was my only pet peeve. Each dish at Veda will take you on an amazing culinary adventure, and while you're at it, don't forget to notice the restaurant's commitment towards preserving their authenticity and identity. 2brahulprabhakar.blogspot.com",Rated 4.5,30,408,??

Priyanka Sinha,"Rated At the risk of sounding like a broken record, Ill have to say that Veda is NOT the place you go to for a romantic fine-dine experience. It is, however, the place you go to for impeccable taste and spot-on flavors! To go into specifics, their Mutton Rarah and Dal Veda are simply amazing. Thats actually all that we tried except the sides. The dal was rich and creamy with the right blend of all that makes the perfect kaali dali. Mutton was really well done too. What took away from our experience was the seating. The tables are laid out in a long hall, along the two walls. So, effectively, you find yourself seated next to another group on the same long sofa (along the wall) with a tiny gap between the tables. The table for two is rather small, and for most time more than enjoying whats on my plate, I was worried about ensuring nothing falls off the table. It was especially bothersome as some of the bigger tables were empty but the hotel staff insisted that we took the smaller table as we were two people. The prices are on the higher side. We shelled about 2.2K for two main dishes, raita and breads. But if youre the kinds who do not care about the moolah as long as the food is great, youd be happy to try this place. The fact that its one of the oldest premier restaurants in CP and candlelit dining happily add to the jazz.",Rated 3.0,11,11,??
Dilsefoodie,"Rated Veda Veda has been in existence since last 10 years and still sustain and consistently good for such long period. We were there to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of VEDA ,last to last week. This beautiful restaurant in the heart of delhi is so great with an eye catching interiors which gives you the Royal feel like a palace. Though the lighting is very dim but it goes perfect with the ambience for any fine dine experience. Now it was time to hit the table with spoons & folks, The list of starters we had were * Pudine mutter ki galouti with chesse Philadelphia (The cheese has a creamy intense taste) which so rare to find in the Capital * The shorba- Asparagus- Served warm in a Kuladd with blanched asparagus, smooth and balance with a delightfully creamy taste. A perfect way to start the meal I can say. * Malai broccoli - cheese marinated grilled touch broccoli, never had broccoli in such a taste and way I think the best way to make the not so broccoli lover eat it like me . * Dahi ke kabab such a fresh , soft and Mouth Melting dahi ke kabab. A must must to order this . * murg malai tikka with a dip named fondue- so unique in nature specially with the dip (first time I ever tried & heard.) * Lamb seekh kabab * Raan * Above all we were so lucky to had a sample of molecular gastronomy, we were served Nitrogen Palak Patta Chaat which was indeed a delight to taste. Unlike the normal fried palak patta chaat, this was something different and tastier. And specially with the concept of live preparation counter, frankly speaking it took my heart away.

Prerit Agrawal,"Rated It was my Dad's birthday when we went to this restaurant. When we entered the first thing which caught our eye was the interiors and they were looking very beautiful in the dim lighting. We ordered Manchurian cauliflower, Dahi kebab and Tulsi Paneer Tikka for appetizers and Paneer khurchan, Dal Veda and Veg Biryani for main course. Everything was good except Dahi kebab and Paneer khurchan didn't had the spices which it should have had. The service was a bit slow. But Overall it's very good.",Rated 4.5,19,32,??
Gundeep Singh,"Rated This fine dining place had been in my list for some time, but unfortunately a visit hadnt materialised. When a foodie friend (Karan Dua) invited me, literally jumped on the opportunity :) for a food review. As soon as I entered got hit by the dcor. Looks like a heritage property and less of a restaurant with huge mirrors/chandeliers and diffused red light all around. Though few of my friends were critical on the dull lights, I enjoyed it and it highlights the old world charm. One of the partners Aman Sahani and shared his vision and about the opening of a Veda Lounge soon; Good job guys!!! Their prime clientele seems to be expats, foreigners and people coming for a romantic evening. Was surprised to notice it was full (its a 65 seater) from 7-11pm that too on a weekday, hence a suggestion Guys do book an advance table before'. Coming to food A special menu was curated for the occasion, tasted a whole lot of veg/Non Veg starters, main course etc. wont go into the nitty-gritty as loads of reviews have been written on zomato. They also seem to have fallen for the Nitrogen brigade doing rounds We tried Palak patta chaat(crispy), for me it is more experiential and aesthetic package than the taste:) Overall the food was neat, but the highlight was Dahi ke Kabab, Dal Makhani and Non veg dishes especially Nihari, biryani among others; perfectly cooked by trained Quereshi Staff (been with them for years). The asparagus shorba was quite refreshing and light. Biryani was well cooked, aromatic and had all the flavours, so was Nihari (fabulous). Infact was so good had 3 helping:). Finally we ended with dessert - Litchi ki tehri was quite different and light. Cons Veg items seemed to me quite ordinary but well cooked. Surprisingly all the non-veg were really light and didnt feel heavy even with all the above bite:). The meal was really heaven to the palate and seemed to have emphasis in quality. Definitely recommended :) P.S the drinks and cocktails for well-made and we tried a few, but for me the killer was Mirchi mocktail (tangy flavoured). ,",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Sanat Malhotra,"Rated Love love love. From the staff to the interiors, everything about this place is perfect for the majestic North Indian dining experience. It's classic in its roots, but modern in its takes. The ambience is perfect, in my opinion, for many different occasions, whether its a dinner out with family, or a romantic date. I tasted many of the appetizers and a few curries and couldn't really find any faults in each thing I tried. The meats/kebabs were succulent and flavorful, and the curries were traditional but rejuvenated almost with new additions to old recipes. For example, I tried a mutton curry with keema in the base sauce - definitely a highlight as everything about it was spectacular. A carnivore's fantasy, the indulgent curry will definitely make me come back for seconds. Another highlight was the chaat, crafted with the help of liquid nitrogen and a CO2 siphon. Loved the aesthetic appeal, as he dipped the fried spinach leaves in the liquid nitrogen and sprayed out aerated dahi into the tub, freezing both the leaves and dahi for a cooling mouthfeel. The core of the chaat remained intact, but Veda introduced me to a completely different version that I hadn't tried before. Loved every bit of it. Yum.",Rated 5.0,18,23,??
Anviti Shiromany(lady.epicurean),"Rated Went to this beautiful restaurant in the heart of delhi. The interiors are mesmerising and give the Royal feel of the palaces of India. The interiors are done by Rohit Bal and a treat to the eyes. The lighting is very dim but it perfectly sets the ambience for any fine dine experience and to enjoy the lavish spread of food. The colour theme is red and beautifully carved mirrors are hanged on the walls. On being seated we were greeted by the owner himself. The first dish that came to us was amuse bouche which is Palak and matter ki galauti with a flavour of mint and topped with Philadelphia cheese. On tasting this we knew that our tastebuds are here for a treat of the lifetime. Then we had some really amazing veg and non veg starters which were Dahi ke kebab these were really nicely prepared with lots of nuts and a distinct flavour of cardamom and kismis. Paneer on fire this was the perfect blend of indian and Chinese with crispy paneer in a tangy Chinese sauce and served in a Kadhai. murgh malai tikka fondue this was the most innovative and creative dish I ever had. The tikka was served on skewers served in a handi which had coal to keep them warm and a bowl of cheese fondue to accompany this. This was innovation par excellence. A definite must have. lahsooni fish tikka was fish chunks well marinated and cooked served on a live tandoor. Again a fabulous dish. lamb seekh kebab was also a wonderful dish and well prepared. Moving to the drinks first of a special mention to the asparagus shorba which was very different and unique it was a thick creamy soup made of asparagus with a indian touch to it. apple and cinnamon mojito was a very refreshing muddled by the owner himself for us it had a very very distinct flavour of cinnamon and blended with vodka peach and apricot with cranberry looked somewhat like a slush but had all the flavours of peach and cranberry. Apricot was a little difficult to find though. But overall a beautiful drink. Coming to the main course we were served Dal Veda which similar to dal makhni but was much more tastier and wasn't that heavy which is a very good thing. Veda dum aloo this is a thick tomato based gravy in which stuffed chunks of potato are fried and served. Chicken shahi korma a very flavour and creamy gravy with well marinated chicken pieces Nihari mutton chunks cooked to perfection Kadhai prawns this again is a very different dish and a delight to the tastebuds. The prawns were cooked along with big chunks of onions and capsicum and were very flavourful. biryani was served in a handi and was great. Last but not the least the dessert. This was definitely the highlight of the evening. The litchi ki Tehri was not just a delight to the tastebuds but also to the eyes. It was so beautifully presented in martini glasses. This was a semolina based phirnee with litchi chunks and rose petals. Again this is a definite must have.

Vickrham (Vicky),"Rated Veda has been in existence since last 10 years and to sustain and be consistently good for such long period in todays world is a breakthrough. We were there to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of VEDA , few days back. To my surprise , it is still flocked by foreigners as it initially was. The menu was special and very well curated by the Chef. The Litchi based mocktail was a great start to the journey. The Amuse Bouche, a galauti style hara bhara kebab was also well created. We were served the Malai chicken Tikka with cheese fondue which was really innovative as it was perfect for the lovely cold weather. The seekh kebab was fine but a little dry to my palette. Being a hardcore non vegetarian , still I loved the Malai Broccoli and the Paneer Tikka. I really liked the whole onion flower which was like onion bhajjia from Mumbai but a whole onion was batter fried cut in the shape of a flower (a little bland from inside though) Chef promised to work on it by adding some masalas to it and improvise it. The Asparagus Soup was awesome; it was served in an earthern cup giving it an Indian touch. The best was creation of the Nitro Palak patta chaat on our tables itself. It was a show par excellence involving molecular skills. The mains included the all time favourite Dal Veda which is one of the best tasting Dal Makhni served in the whole country. The Mutton Nahari was good and the Raan (leg of lamb) was too good. But, we were almost full by now and were not able to relish anything else properly. There were at least 5 more dishes to be tasted but sorry, I could not and even skipped the Biryani , which was also one of the best as told to me by other foodies. Still, we enjoyed our desserts and specially the chocolate paan at the end. Overall, a very beautiful restaurant with the most romantic interiors and the most soul satisfying food, in the whole city.

Ankita Banerjee,"Rated 10 years in the hospitality business and Veda is still as stunning as ever. This high end fine dining restaurant recently celebrated its 10 years anniversary and I was extremely glad to be a part of this celebration. Located in the H block, this place is literally 5 minutes walk from the Rajiv Chowk metro station. The first word that came to my mind when I entered this place was spectacular. Rohit Bal has designed the interiors of this place and his signature mark Lotus is showcased all over the walls. The decor includes huge antique mirrors on the walls, wonderful chandeliers and huge candle holders. Apparently the place looks even more beautiful in the evening because it lits up in the glow of the candle lights. The decor is done in the theme of red and the seating is extremely plush and comfortable. A special menu was curated for this occasion and I got to try a lot of delicacies. Beginning with the starters -: 1. Pudine mutter ki galouti with Philadelphia Cheese - Loved the way this dish was presented, extremely pretty it was. The galouti was soft in texture and the balance of flavors was too good. Totally recommend this dish. 2. Asparagus Shorba - First time in my life I tasted asparagus shorba and I was completely blown away by the taste. It was creamy with an intense taste of asparagus. Amazing creation from the house of Veda. Must try !!! 3. Malai Broccoli - Perfectly cooked broccoli in a heavy malai dressing, quite liked it. 4. Blooming Onion - Feel in love with the way this dish was presented. The onion really looked like it was blooming and was so beautifully crispy and well seasoned. Must try !!! 5. Dahi Ke Kebab - Although am not that fond of dahi, but these kebabs incorporated with dry fruits, had really soft texture and tasted quite good. 6. Murg Malai Tikka Fondue - Soft, juicy and yummy chicken tikkas along with cheese fondue, served in a big copper pot. Loved the presentation as well as the taste. 7. Lamb Seekh Kebab - Extremely well seasoned and well prepared this dish was. The kebab was very soft and flavorful. Recommended. 8. Mutton Burrah - Its not like the dish wasn't flavorful but I found the mutton to be a bit chewy, so didn't enjoy it that much. 9. Achari Fish Tikka - Soft and succulent fish tikka prepared in an achari marination with slight hint of ajwain as well. Must try !!! 10. Paneer On Fire - The dish was served in a small black kadhai, the dish is prepared in ketchup so the flavor of ketchup is quite potent. Although I just tried the veggies particularly bell peppers from this dish, it was very nicely prepared. In drinks I tried quite a few in house specialities and I loved them all :- 1. Californian Chi Chi - This was an extremely pretty looking mocktail. It was a combination of peach sorbet and apricot slush and tasted just wow. 2. Chilli Coriander Martini - This vodka based cocktail had an amazing chilly kick to it, this drink is absolutely made for Indian palate. Highly recommended. 3. Apple Cinnamon Mojito - This was a very fruity vodka based cocktail , apple and cinnamon flavors were quite potent. 4. Pineapple Ginger Martini - I absolutely love the combination of pineapple and ginger. This vodka base drink was an absolute delight, highly recommended. 5. Spider Bite - It is their in house sweet, sour and spicy cocktail with green chilly infused vodka. This was my favorite cocktail of the day, highly recommended. 6. Brain Hoemorrhage Shot - By far one of the most prettiest shot that I have ever tried. I totally feel in love with the presentation. Combination of peach schnapps, baileys and dash of grenadine this was and tasted amazing. Must try !!! Now lets come to the main course -: 1. Dal Veda - By far one of the best dal makhni I have ever tasted, this dish is a must try. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 2. Chicken Shahi Korma - Perfectly cooked chicken in an amazingly flavorful gravy, too good. 3. Mutton Nihari - The mutton was soft and succulent and the gravy was extremely delicious. By far one of the best nihari I have tasted. 4. Kadhai Prawns - Totally loved this prawn preparation. I am not that fond of prawns because of its pungent smell, but this particular dish was so flavorful that I didn't get bothered by the smell at all. 5. Lamb Biryani - My oh my, I can rave about this dish for hours. After eating soooooo much I went for a second helping of this dish, just imagine that. Thats how flavorful and delicious this was. Perfectly cooked lamb with amazingly flavorful and aromatic rice, thats how I would describe it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 6. Bread Basket - Mix of 2 rotis, kulcha & naan, all the items were well and good. Lastly comes the desserts -: 1. Litchi Ki Tehri - Absolutely amazing creation from the house of veda. This is one of a kind dessert that I got to try and am immensely glad of that fact. Wobbly litchi pieces with sweet tehri, taste was fantabulous. Again a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED dish. 2. Phirni - Just loved the way this dish was served. The phirni was creamy in texture with absolutely right amount of sweetness and tasted amazing. So, I will end my review by saying that visit to Veda is a MUST. They have got some amazing dishes to offer that will surely tingle your tastebuds and provide you with an unique culinary experience. spiceslicebite.wordpress.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

When I entered this place I didn't expect it 2b so mesmerising . Take a step in & u enter into red dimlights with candle lit chandeliers, detailed extensive designs with mirrored wall ceilings.

Pudine matar ki Galauti wd Philidephia cheese-- This beauty was yummy 4d eyes & d tummy 2 :) The Philadelphia cheese has a creamy intense taste that compliments the galauti so well. SUPER YUM! 2. Asparagus shorba-- Served hot in a Kuladd wd blanched asparagus, it was really balanced.. Leaving a delightfully creamy taste. 3. Paneer on Fire-- This one's my absolute favourite. Fiery,Spicy,tangy, presented beautifully wd rich never dieing flavours. 4. Malai Broccoli-- cheese marinated delight 4d broccoli lovers :) 5. Dahi ke kebab-- Mouth Melting. 5. Nitrogen paalak ki chat-- Star of the night. It was a delight seeing it being prepared live. Came out beautifully with drooling flavours. Crisp paalak patta in the chat is what u never find anywhere but here it's their major concern & so have adopted the molecular gastronomy technique. 6. Murg malai tikka, fish tikka & raan are nonveg MUST HAVES :) 7. Till I reached the mains, i was full till d neck Still the mains occupied my plate so deservingly dt I didn't hv space 4 my breads.

Prateek Sharma,"Rated The BEST fine dining restaurant in Delhi. No, it's not listed as the best, but no one can deny who has been a patron of Veda. It will absorb you completely as soon as you enter it. I have not been to such a beautiful, magnificent and lavish fine dining restaurant ever. It was on my wishlist since a very long time but there are a lot of good fine dining options available in the city so i didn't consider it much until i read an amazing review by Dr. RadhIka Agarwal and finally visited it 2 days back. AMBIENCE: Lavish Red theme Royal look I got to know from the reviews of some foodies that the interiors are done by Rohit Bal. He has done an amazing job i would say. The entire look is very expensive. I am a big fan of the restaurants sparkling in red and Veda hit me right in the feels. It gives a very premium look. The walls are full of big splendid glasses, giving a very royal look and roofs are beautified with large chandeliers which emit yellow/gold light. It's this fusion of red and yellow that's breathtaking. It took me good 10 minutes to absorb each and every corner because it's dark and the red light is very soft. Creativity is infused in every bit of this place. Besides the tables, tall lamps are placed. I am not very good with the terms of interior decor, so kindly excuse me. Its looks like a lamp post and multiple yellow bulbs are studded on the top. FOOD: Portions can be upped Menu is Simple and concise Very Delicious I regret that i was already stuffed after having starters at some other place and went here because a friend wanted to eat some authentic Dal Makhni. This place struck me then. We had a Dal Veda and 2 butter Naan. The dal was outstanding. We literally wanted to scratch every bit of it from the bowl. Butter naan were very soft and didn't turn rubbery. SOMETHING DIFFERENT- The onions were served in a very stylish bowl. Usually restaurants don't focus on seving onions, dips, mint chutney etc in a different way. SERVICE: Polite, Courteous In a hurry to wind up I called them up on 01.01.16 to book a table for my family, it would have been a perfect family dinner on the first day of the new year but the waiting time was more than 2 hours.

And with the concept of live preparation counter, it took our hearts away. Blooming Onion The pyaaz pakoras never sounded so different to us earlier! As the name was so different, the pakoras were as well. Served with the mint sauce, it was a perfect appetizer of an Indian. Malai Broccoli Broccoli dipped in cream and grilled well was what it was all about. A best way to make the not so broccoli lover eat it.

Innovative with a wonderful presentation of a vertically standing chili, the shorba just touched our heart the moment we sipped it. A must try for you if you havent had the luck to do it till now. Then came the yummy eye-catching appetizers: Nitrogen Palak Patta Chaat - Unlike the normal fried palak patta chaat, this was something different and tastier. And with the concept of live preparation counter, it took our hearts away. Blooming Onion The pyaaz pakoras never sounded so different to us earlier! As the name was so different, the pakoras were as well. Served with the mint sauce, it was a perfect appetizer of an Indian. Malai Broccoli Broccoli dipped in cream and grilled well was what it was all about. A best way to make the not so broccoli lover eat it. Paneer on Fire When the simple Chili Paneer is renamed as paneer on fire, the entire expectations changes to something more exotic and fiery. And Vedas Paneer on Fire met our expectations in terms of its presentation as well as taste. We were still relishing our appetizers even after finishing them; we were offered their Main Course delicacies. Paneer Kundan Kaliyan A different, yet so authentic, tasty paneer dish which a perfect amount of sweetness and spices. It was actually a mashed paneer stuffed into kofta which made it a royal dish. Dal Veda - A perfect Dal Makhani being the Vedas special, it was a perfect complement to the Paneer. Breads There was a huge number of options to choose from the fresh breads The cherry on the cake was the beautiful, yummy, not to be missed was the dessert - Litchi Ki Tehri. Unlike any other dessert, it was served in the tall glass and was a combination of Rabri with Litchi pieces and rose petals. A perfect Indian Desi dessert for a sweet tooth like us! Veda is a place for the people who would just love the authentic Indian food over anything else. The ambiance, the service, the promptness and the seating, are add ons to your comfort and will definitely make sure that you fall in love with Veda!

Rajeev Nangia,"Rated In the past decade had heard so much about this place , the great baroque setting created by Mr Rohit Bal , masterly use of the best spices to creat muglai culinary masterpieces , a must visit kind of place for the lovers of these two styles , for me personally ,all the wrong reasons , being more of a new age guy , I prefer the minimalist settings , more straight lines and clear light and on the food front too , my taste buds had moved away from the strong tastes , preferring more subtle flavours , also I am ashamed to acknowledge that in spite of being a true blooded Punjabi , am not a big fan of either North Indian or Muglai form of cooking , booth are to greasy for my liking. So the entire 10 years avoided dinning here , which I today accept was totally my loss. Last Sunday I was invited by a fellow foodie friend to be a part of celebrations , celebrating the completion of their ten years , a very long time to continue remaining relevant in today's fast evolving fine dine business. Despite the above reasons that had kept me away from this place for so long , the opportunity of interacting with other foodies made me accept the invite.and I was so glad that I did as it broke loads of myths for me . As I entered I was wonder stuck by the grandure , overwhelming , but not gaurdy as I had feared more so in a very romantic way , was a place where one would take their girlfriend to propose to her . There is ample use of rich colours , chandeliers , a lintel spread of Rohit Bal signature Lotuses , the effort that has gone into designing the place was so apparent in the details , the mosaic flooring , beautiful MOP inlayed stone tables and even the classic Italian , mock marble basin in the Men's restroom. Totally breathtaking . Our host for the day was Mr. .Aman Sahani , who is a partner in a new lounge by the same group coming next door , a very pleasant person with vast knowledge and in-depth understanding of the food business. We were also introduced to their executive chef , whose name I forgot , but again a highly experienced and knowledgeable person. He was ably assisted by a team of courteous , well groomed and efficient serve staff ., totally worth the fine dine tag. Now on to the food , one thing that was common to all the dishes as well as the drinks in the service was world class presentation , they were all very appetising visually . The same goes for the quality of ingredients , top shelf undoubtedly. On the flavour front I found some misses but they were so insignifent and also the fact that choice of flavours is a very personal matter. The service started with a beautifully presented amuse bouche , a taste bud tantaliser , Pudine mutter ki galouti with Philadelphia cheese , soft and delicious Kababs made of mint and peas nicely placed on a coin shaped , corn flour flat bread , topped with creamy Philly cheese , it surely served its purpose of tantalising my taste buds. This was followed by a light Asparagus broth , a shorba actually , served in an earthenware khullar , nice presentation and a hearty and comforting broth. Then the appetiser service started , the first dish out , have to admit , a disappointment for me , was a Nitrogen palak patra chat , prepared live on our table ,personally by the executive chef , loads of Theater, but for me , it missed the flavour bus.Molecular gastronomy is the big thing now a days , but just flash freezing every thing in the name of fusion just dose not work , yes the Nitrogen made the spinach leave crisp , but iris the batter and the frying that imparts that special flavour , also tiny white puddles of liquified nitrogen , looking like shaving foam droppings on my plate sure were not appetising. This was followed by Malai broccoli and Paneer on fire , both Kababs reasonably nice , actually the Broccoli was more than reasonable , it was quite delicious. Then cam another not so great dish , the Dahi ke kebab , hung yogurt coins , slightly insipid , shallow fried nicely on one side while the other side was raw. The vege starters cumulated with a beautifully presented Awesome Blossom or as the menu described itBlooming onion , a crisp mixed flour coated , while onion fritter , beautiful and delicious , this was served with a mint dip , a suggestion , the melted cheese fondue that came later with a non veg starter would have paired better with this western flavour , but nice even the way it came. Now on to the big stars of the day , the non veg starters , all better tasting than the last one , first Murg Malai tikka fondue , nicely spiced and well cooked fiery Tikkas served with molten cheese fondue , rich and creamy , which added a new dimension to the traditional flavour. Lamb seekh kebab , flavoursome lamb mince sheeks , cooked firm , just right and great quality lamb , followed by Raan of lamb , just one word for it , perfection. This section was rounded of with , flavoursome , flaky and fresh fish with a garlic based marinate BBQed perfectly in form of Lahsooni fish tikka. Near perfect non veg starter selection. Now it was time for the mains , was not really hungry after tucking in to so many starters but the foodies greed took over , though I ate selectively. In the veg selection they served us Paneer kind an Kalyan , cottage cheese in a saffron past like sauce , Veda dum Allo , their take on the traditional Kashmiri dish and the heart of any North Indian meal , Kali dal , done in their signature style and called Dal Veda , I ate non of those so frankly can not comment. The non veg section consisted of one dish that I did not eat , chicken shahi korma , so no comment there too , but what I ate was truly heavenly. Lamb Nihari , perfection in a pot , Kadai prawns , fresh creamy prawns cooked with just the right amount and flavour of spice and ofcourse another star dish of the day , Lamb Biryani , served out of a dough sealed clay pot , great aroma and wonderfully cooked Lamb in great Basmati rice , just too good to describe. This meal fit for an emperor was crowned with a worthy crown , the desert , Lichi ki tehri , sweet as honey Lichis floating in a sweet and dense milk reduction with a subdued rose flavour, a must try. Though not on the menu they served some nice cocktails too , being lunch and in spite of it being a Sunday I had some business meetings lined up for later in the afternoon so I was avoiding alcohol , but on insistence of my gracious host Mr.Aman Sahani , I did taste a green chilli based martini , very refreshing and unique , am sure am going back soon to have lots more of them , so delicious. So the place is defiantly and highly recommend for big family get together a and cozy romantic date. ENJOY",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Priyanshu Kumar,"Rated one of the best place for fine dining in the capital. The place serves you authentic Indian flavors in soothing dim lights, lovely ambiance, nicely designed chandelliers and artifacts, glazing mirrors, well crafted interiors and furnishings makes it the perfect place for candle light dinner. The classic music/trance complements the place very well. The iconic ""lotus"" of Rohit BAl - the ace designer of India, was adding an external beauty to the place, which beautifully decorated the walls and artifacts, as the place interiors has been designed by him. Thanks to Candid Social and Veda management team for organizing and inviting me for the foodie meet up on their special day - completion of 10 glorious years in the industry. The staffs were courteous, friendly and prompt at their services. now - food & drinks : I had one with the vodka base which was fine but average at taste. Red wine sangria was good. Chilli Mlabar drink & Apple and Cinnamon Mojito. Some malabar drink which came in a original coconut shell was the eye candy. Coming on to the food - I started with * Malai Broccoli - looked creamy a tasted delicious. Then I had * Murgh Malai Tikka fondue - simply loved it. * Lehsooni fish tikka - Seafood is something that is an all time favourite. The tikka was cooked with perfection. Then tried * Chicken shahi korma - the taste was good, but the gravy was slight less thick in nature, *Lamb seekh kebab - great at taste. the mutton pices could have been a bit more softer. *Raan - a perfect marination of mutton & chicken into spices. Delightful it was ! * Mutton Nihari and Biryani were awesome ata taste. Nihari had perfectly cooked mutton pieces and the gravy was well thick and rich in taste. * Desserts - Litchi Ki Tehri - looked delicate and lovely and tasted heavenly. The sweetness was perfect, the essence and presence of litchi made the dish, out of the box and a must try here. recommendation - a perfect place for a romantic date.

Vaibhav Jain,"Rated Was here at the Best Fine Dine restaurant on its 10th anniversary i.e. 10 glorious year celebrations on Sunday the 20th December, 2015. To celebrate with the team of amazing people. The best thing about this place is ""THE PLACE IN ITSELF"" is so sorted and gives you a right understanding about what are planning to eat and feel in the moment in those moments. Interiors were all that my eyes never got off from. ;) Starting with the food reviews for that days meet to celebrate the occasion. AMUSE BOUCHE PUDINE MATAR KI GALOUTI WITH PHILADELPHIA This mini dish on the plate with superb presentation was as delicious for me as it was cute in look. Yeah cute food.

STARTERS NITROGEN PALAK PATTA CHAAT The presentation, the taste all very superb - the concept and i liked this one alot. 4.5/5 Blooming onion You can also call it pyaaz ka pakora - it was something differently designed and nice in taste - I generally don't eat pyaaz ka pakoras but this Blooming onion with green sauce was as one best thing to order and taste here. 5/5 Malai Broccoli It was a broccoli with malai - it was good in taste too.

Sumit Sehgal (foodiesumit),"Rated Vda recently invited us foodies' to celebrate its glorious 10 years long journey, that how it has grown and stayed in business for ten long years whereas its rivals in the same vicinity has come and gone. Having heard so much good things about the restaurant and its ambiance, I was eager to see what it was that people were going crazy about. Ambiance: 5/5 Everybody know that the interiors have been done by Rohit Bal and everything, but trust me guys this place stands out. The interiors are the uniquest that I have seen with the beautiful chandeliers emitting the soft lighting and creating the perfect ambiance for a good meal and the beautifully arranged backlit mirrors makes the restaurant look artistic from every point of view. This place totally stands out in terms of ambiance. Service: 3/5 The thing that I disliked was that I had to repeat a number of times that I wanted a drink, but still it didn't came and after a point I stopped bothering. Though the staff was humble, courteous and well mannered but I didn't see the point of not listening to the customers at all. But apart from it, everything was taken care of. Food: 4/5 The dishes that stood out for me were Asparagus Shorba Having tasted nothing like it before, it was something I loved to the core. Served in a kullad, the flavorsome shorba was tangy and left an unusual taste in the mouth which was creamy and very different. Nitrogen Palak Patta Chat The preparation of this chat was the highlight of the meet. The chef himself made it right in front of us and it looked splendid while it was being made. The taste whereas was usual and pretty average. Malai Broccoli The all so creamy broccoli was definitely worth trying. It tasted yumm, and is a must have for all the vegetarians. Murgh Malai Tikka Fondue I haven't seen a place go wrong with such a dish, and same was the case here. Served in its own unique way, Murgh Malai Tikka was definitely a thumbs up too. Lehsooni Fish Tikka I have never really been fond of seafood, but the fish tikka probably the best I have eaten, period. It was juicy and tender, and melted as soon as it reached our tongues. Paneer Kundan Kaliyan I was having doubts while eating it that whether it was really paneer or some other dish, it was that good. A bit sweet for some, but I totally loved it. It looked different and it tasted much different than the regular paneer dish that you eat. Chicken Shahi Korma The gravy though was a bit watery, but still the taste of the dish was good. The chicken was juicy and delicious. Lichi ki Tehri If you have a sweet tooth, then you gotta try this one. It has the perfect amount of sweetness and was a delight for sure. Lichi lovers won't find anything as good as this. Value for Money: 4/5 A bit on the expensive side, Vda is definitely worth a visit on special occasions. Overall Rating: 4/5 You'll definitely fall in love with the place once you visit.",Rated 4.0,137,576,??
Dr. RadhIka Agarwal,"Rated Veda is my favorite place to dig in for scrumptious meal. The richness of this place is spellbound. The decor is tastefully done with chandeliers, mirrors and red lights. Intricate interiors reflects the style of Rohit Bal's designs. Whole ambience is welcoming. Also the food is exceptionally good. I tried the following items- 1) Amuse bouche- this unique appetizer was beautifully presented. Pudine mutter ki galouti topped with philadelphia cheese-RECOMMENDED. Galouti melted in my mouth and was tasty. 2) Asparagus shorba- oh this was heavenly! This was one of a kind! Also the first time I had something exclusive of asparagus. Shorba was warming and soothing. 3) Blooming onion- again a stunner! Presentation was beautiful- a blooming onion! It was nothing but onion ka pakora! It was delicious! 4) Malai broccoli- I have tried many broccoli starters at various places but never liked it. Thankfully at Veda, broccoli was tastefully made! I loved the creamy broccoli. 5) Dahi ke kebab- this was ok. Not really liked it! 6) Paneer on fire- this was delicious. Spicy and tangy notes were there. Loved it. 7) Nitrogen palak patta chaat- Nowadays molecular gastronomy is new kid in the block to attract foodies! This palak patta chaat was made with some molecular touch. Loved the way it was prepared. I would have uploaded the video only if Zomato had this feature! It was just beautiful. Taste was also awesome. 8) Paneer kundan kaliyan- this was a main course item. It was also spicy and I loved it. 9) Veda Dum Aloo- This main course dish was tempting. Do try it if you love dum aloo! 10) Dal Veda- Of all the main course items, this dish was a stunner. I would rate it 10/10. Perhaps Veda is one of the top places to serve such lip-smacking dal makhni . You would drool for sure! RECOMMENDED 11) Litchi tehri- this dessert was delectable. Presentation was beautiful. If you are a litchi lover, then you will dig in to this beauty and will love it. The texture was smooth and flavour was indeed yummy. It will give you sugar rush for sure. Also do try signature mocktails and cocktails at Veda. Loved it! Do visit this place for classy fine dine experience!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Travelerwithfeetandstories,"Rated This is place is setting New standards in fine dining. The decor is a mix of many elements, unlike the usual blingy decor of Indian Food Places. Medium and large mirrors on the walls balancing whatever little light was being emitted by the dim lamps. The tables have beautiful intricate inlay work and beautiful plates are used. I tried the paneer mutter ki Galauti with Philadelphia cheese- the slightly sour and tasted of cheese balancing the neutral mushy taste Of the galauti. The presentation was just spot on. Asparagus shorba was splendid. The creamy shorba with an intense taste Of asparagus,it was warming and comforting. Nitrogen patta chaat was a treat to watch,however I didn't like the taste of it much. The blooming onion were beautiful to look at. Next I tried the Malai Brocolli,i personally don't like broccoli cooked with heavy dressings hence I didnt Like this one. The paneer on fire was tangy and firm,just right. Lasooni Fish tikka was perfect. Flaky,Melt in the mouth fish,with the pungent taste of Mustard,this was one of the best fish tikkas ever. The dal Veda was yummy. The makhani dal,not overly creamy,perfectly spiced. The star was the dessert - litchi ki tehri. Wobbly litchi pieces and gritty sweet tehri,this became a favourite. I wanna go back just to eat 10 servings of this. Yummy! Overall Veda is a beautiful place with excellent food.

Deep,"Rated VEDA is one if the most majestic looking places that one can find in CP. With very elegant decor, each and every corner of this place looks like a lot of thought process is involved. The seating is very comfortable, the dim lights n slow classical music is spot on. The place was full of expats on their 10th anniversary and they had prepared an exquisite fine - dine menu. Now coming to the food, I had mixed feelings when it comes to what it felt on my palates; else on presentation, plating and service, it doesn't get better than this in most of the places I have been to. Started with an Asparagus soup- I was quite happy with it, but would have been happier if I was sick. In my opinion, it just didn't blend well with the amazing mocktail served to me before. Then comes the Nitrogen Palak chaat which did catch a lot of attention, the way it was prepared, was delicious indeed, but to be honest, it tasted the same as it tasted in all the places I have tried. Imagine having those sugar flowers (*budhiya ke baal* as they call in my hometown), as kids we were so amazed looking at them in astonishment as they were prepared, but in the end, no matter how fancy they looked, they all tasted the same. But in case of a nitrogen chaat there are so many possibilities, textures and flavours to play with, then why every place is sticking with the same receipe. Then comes the star of the lunch- Malai tikka fondue, perfectly made juicy tikkas combined very well with the creamy fondue which created a melancholy of flavours with every step down my palate. Raan was quite tasty, marinated and spiced to excellence, but just a last burnt bite of my massive piece did destroy my mood. I guess the chefs should be paying more attention that none of the bitter burnt chunks go out. The main course was a delight and also something they specialise in. From naans to nihari, chicken korma to laccha paranthas, they have it all what's required to get a tag of fine dining indian restaurant. I quite liked their veg food too. The biryani was nice, but I prefer my biryani with minimal spices with a good raita which sure they provided. Finally the dessert: Lichi ki tehri - well, I don't have a sweet tooth at all, in fact I hate the sweet aftertaste , so I can't review about it. All I remember that I tasted some litchi dipped in milkmaid kheer which was quite edible, the girls liked it though. On a whole, veda doesn't disappoint at all and the chefs know their craft well, but there is still a little room for improvement in the kitchen. None of the dishes are flawed, but I couldn't remember the taste of any dish the day after, except the chicken tikka fondue. In a way, it's like a perfectly functional smartphone, but don't expect an I phone 6 or galaxy s6 or whatever you think is better.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Aruna Bansal,"Rated Vedas a perfect place for romantic date. This is what I felt as soon as I entered it. Beautiful interiors designed by Rohit Bal. Chandeliers and beautiful mirrors totally gives it a royal feel. The ambiance of this place is really beautiful. I visited Vedas for the first time on its 10th Anniversary Celebration. Coming to the food, I had the following: Pudine mutter ki galouti with philadelphia cheese : It was pudina and peas tikki just like galouti served with pita alongwith cheese. The dish was beautifully presented and tasted good. Asparagus shorba : Asparagus Shorba is a soup served nicely in a kullad and was full of flavours. Nitrogen Palak Patta Chaat: The chef prepared this dish on our table and it was presented beautifully and tasted really good. Earlier I have had Palak Patta Chaat but this Nitrogen Palak Patta Chaat was new for me it had frozen yogurt in it and the chaat tasted really good. Nicely presented and served and its a must try. Good experiment with Palak Patta Chaat. Blooming Onion: Its actually a Pyaaz ka Pakoda served along with green chutney. Good presentation again. Murg Malai tikka Fondue: Ahhaaa I was really very tasty. Murg Malai Tikka served with melted cheese. This was heaven. Loved it. Its a must have. Lamb seekh kabab : You can also call it Mutton Seekh Kabab. Nicely presented and taste was also good. Raan : Raan is a mutton and chicken marinated in spices. It looked so tempting and was fill of flavours. One bite and I was like can I have more. Had Dahi ke Kebabs, Paneer on fire and lahsooni fish tikka too all were made to perfection and full of flavours. Had many mocktails too name I am really not able to recall. One was their signature mocktail served something chilli, malabari drinks and much more. My personal fav is Apple and Cinnamon Mojito. In the main course I had Paneer Kundan Kaliyan, Veda Dum Aloo, Dal Veda, Chicken Shahi Korma, Nihari and biryani all were full of flavours and tasted really good.

Rahul Batra,"Rated VEDA has all the veds to ring the bells of your heart!!! This beautiful place just celebrated its 10th anniversary and i believe Rohit Bal has created a masterpiece in terms of decor and feel. The place has a royal look and i believe that is what is the USP now. Serving Indian and Mughlai with a little bit of fusion in some of the dishes Veda has come in my good books already. Drinks They have this chilly vodka cocktail which will burn you off from inside if you try more than one in any case. Asparagus Shorba - Personally I don't prefer asparagus despite having heard about its medicinal properties, but they have made it very well with full flavor of asparagus imbibed in it. Starters Nitrogen palak patta chaat - basically something which you would say dahi papdi which was made frozen with nitrogen. Have it with your bare hands, spoon is not recommended. Murgh malai tikka fondue - Indian have this very bad habit of having any tikka with mint chutney. But they have come out with fondue which made the journey of food exciting for me. Lamb Seekh Kebab Raan - I always get sold on Mutton (basically red meat) and this is what they did to me. I still have the taste of this dish while I am writing at the moment. Some people might find it a little hard but trust me it is optimally cooked with richness of flavor inside. Main Course Nihari - again one hell of a mutton dish, as expected the mutton was soft and gravy was rich with flavors. Lamb Biryani - something similar with the restaurants these days, serving the biryani in a pot which comes with seal of flour all around. although I love Mutton, but i feel rice could still be of better quality to make it better. Dessert Litchi ki tehri - All the sweetness is of litchi and tehri is a simple dish which is garnished with litchi to make it better. You can avoid it. Overall for Indian and Mughlai food, I think it is the best place in CP. Cheers... bragstreet.in",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Sanchi Arora,"Rated The first thing that intrigues you as soon as you enter Veda, is the beautiful interiors. With a royal feel, the colorful mirrors and chandeliers will win your hearts over. Mr. Rohit Bal has done full justice to the concept and the very ambience of this beauty. Moving on with the starters, what is certainly recommended is the Murg Malai tikka with the cheese fondue. Having tried this combination for the first time, I was certainly impressed with the perfectly cooked chicken and cheese sauce. The amritsari fish was very soft and succulent and went well with their pudina chutney which was thick and flavorful. For vegetarians, try the dahi ke kebab and the Nitrogen palak patta chaat, which was different, while the whole nitrogen process was a treat to the eyes. Crunchy and flaky palak, you won't stand disappointed. The asparagus shorba however, was not something that stood out and can be avoided. For the mains, dal veda is a definite yes to your meal. Perfect consistency and balanced flavors, deserves a try. The dum aloo was decent but nothing really to write home about. The lamb biryani was well balanced and went well with the raita, would have loved it even more if it was a notch higher on the spice. The chicken korma and garlic naan were the perfect combination! Balanced gravy with a flaky naan, a must have here. I absolutely loved my apple and cinnamon mojito which had bits of fresh cinnamon, a refreshing change from the usual. For desserts, make sure you try the Litchi tehri, for it is very different from the usual, and the milk and litchi totally compliment each other.

Prashant Singh,"Rated This was my first visit to Veda in Connaught place. Have visited there Vasant Kunj outlet earlier. The decore of both the places is quite on similar lines. Gives a royal feel and matches the Royal Mughlai cuisine theme. We were invited to be a part of the 10th Anniversary celebration of Veda. They have the same menu but now the team have innovated the serving style of the dishes and are trying to be innovative in presentation. They are definitely going to keep the flavours authentic and are not going to do any fusion food. Our meal started with Amuse Bouche. They served us Pudine Matar ki Galauti with Philadelphia Cheese. This was the only dish which was having something which we never see in an Indian food. The texture was perfect and it tasted real good. The Philadelphia cheese complimented the dish completely. The next was Asparagus Shorba. Didn't expect much from it but it turned out to be just superb. The other dishes to follow in the starters were Murg Malai Tikka, Fish Tikka, Raan, Blooming Onions, Seekh Kebab and Nitrogen Palak ki Chaat. Nitrogen Palak ki Chaat was prepared live in front of us. The making of the Chaat was definitely a visual treat. It tasted good as well. The best of the starters was the Murg Malai Tikka. Extremely soft and succulent. The marination was perfect. Raan, Seekh Kebab and Fish Tikka were also good. For the mains we had Prawn Masala, Chicken Korma, Nihari, Butter Chicken and Daal Makhani. Nihari was just Ok. I expected it to be better. Prawn masala and Chicken Korma were good though. We also had Mutton Biryani. The Biryani was highlight of the main course. Full of flavours and was exactly what we expected it to be. The daal was also very good. For desserts we were served Litchi Tehri. Presented in a martini glass, the dessert looked as good as it tasted. Litchi is amongst my favourite fruits, so I was happiest person to have this dessert. I could definitely see that Team was trying to match the newly opened places and also wanted to keep the authenticity.

After reading such good reviews, we were determined to have food here only..so we waited for 90 minutes for dinner.. And when we didn't get any response from management for seating, we entered the restaurant and to our utter surprise, they were busy pleasing international customers while having many seats empty... After this disappointing experience, we ordered Veda special dal makhani and rogan josh. We were served with complimentary papad and chutney which was good, no doubt.

Poorvi Singh Chaudhary,"Rated Veda restaurant is a family establishment situated in the CP. I took my fianc to this place for late lunch on Tuesday and the moment we entered the place, we fell in love with the dcor of the place. It is decorated with shades of reds and with lots of mirror and chandeliers. Although I went there for lunch, according to the senior captain Rameshwar, Veda is a place to visit in the evening as the setting is very romantic and there are candles everywhere. Coming to the food, we ordered tomato shorba followed by cauliflower Manchurian and batti paneer tikka in the starters they also provided us with complimentary papad with chuttni. Out of all the things that I had in starter, I only like tomato shorba, they used matthi instead of bread stick and I loved it and after that Manchurian was good. There was nothing very good or remotely good with the taste or with its presentation. Everything was very average and Paneer tikka was extremely blunt in taste. In beverage, we ordered ginger fizz which was basically stale Miranda with a hint of ginger and Virgin mojito which tasted very strongly of mint. Moving on to the main course, we ordered vegetarian meal plates which comprised of Dal Makhani, mix Vegetable, rice and 2 pieces of bread. If I have to rate this plate, I would give 2 out of 5. As there was nothing which was mouth smacking or good, everything tasted bland, poorly cooked and devoid of any spices what so ever. Mix vegetable tasted better than the daal, but it only tasted good in comparison. After such an ordeal, we decided to skip dessert from this place and settled on kwality walls ice cream. I dont understand what went wrong with their kitchen today and made this whole experience disastrous, another thing which I did not like about this place was the amount of the portion they served with starter, it was way less and not acceptable (no value for money). If there is something I liked about this place was its service, it was quick and efficient and very polite. Apart from this and the dcor, we didnt like anything about this restaurant.",Rated 2.5,27,34,??
Manish Saini,Rated It's not the first time I visited this place... But yea it was after a long time I went to have a family dinner at Veda...

In short A Must Visit Place...,Rated 5.0,7,35,??
Gurneet Kaur,"Rated I was given the responsibility of choosing the restaurant for a typical Punjabi family get together. Pind Balluchi is my usual first option but I decided to experiment and went ahead with Veda. Special mention to the entire staff who took all possible efforts to make our experience amazing. We were waiting for our guests and one hour we didn't order anything. Not even one waiter made a big deal out of it and understood our plight and Delhi traffic. This is happening when the restaurant is packed. The ambience is beautiful giving a place a rustic yet classy look. Such attention to details made the restaurant look perfect! We ordered the following: DAL VEDA Just the right amount of heat, this was a favorite at our table. Not sweet and not overly creamy. With every bite I could taste the flavors and the effort that went into making it. Must try! TANDOORI CHICKEN Eight pieces of delicious chicken as starters! Totally worth the price. However, it was a little dry. MALAI KOFTA This for me was the STAR Dish. Soft koftas in subtle flavored gravy. Mildly spiced, this was a favorite at the table. Much better than the PB version in its vicinity BREAD BASKET Do order this. It has a combination of all types. I opted for the pudina parantha, tandoori roti, garlic naan and onion kulcha. The last one was the best. This entire basket was so convenient as it covered all my favourites. We reordered it. Overall an amazing experience! I recommend this place for all those outings with family!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Aparajita Sinha,"Rated Since rating lower than this is not possible, I am rating Veda 1.0. I visited the restaurant on a weekday evening. The restaurant was almost completely empty but for three tables occupied. Yet, the table offered to us was right at the entrance facing the door. When we requested for a different table, the waiters said that all other tables were reserved for bookings more than an hour away. We were a small group of 3 who could have easily left the restaurant after finishing a meal in that time frame. After witnessing such display of a false sense of popularity, we left for a much, much better experience at Desi Vibes! Very poor customer service, so poor that the customer didn't even get down to tasting their food! One more thing, the restaurant is classified as a Casual Dining destination but the ambience is more suited to a bar or lounge. It was so dark that it almost looked dingy to be a restaurant and I'm quite sure that reading a menu would be difficult. Very disappointing experience.",Rated 1.0,5,47,??

Yukthi Aggarwal,"Rated It's a foreign tourists favorite. Even at 7 in the evening it wasn't deserted despite being a holiday but all we could see were foreigners surrounding us. So I guess food caters to them more than locals, but this fact really doesn't disappoint because the dishes are full of flavor. The tulsi paneer tikka doesn't have the prominent flavor of tulsi but it might be because it's taste can be overpowering for most. Nonetheless it was a good balance of flavored and seasoning, the hint of cheese made it all the more delicious for me. Next comes the main course for which we ordered Daal Veda which I could not stop licking, the best part being that it wasn't super creamy. The breads however disappointed, the garlic n oregano naan did not have the taste of oregano but was still edible in comparison to the tandoori roti. The ambiance is almost palatial more fort like with right settings of Venetian mirrors surrounding the walls a dimly lit red chandelier and flicker candles adorning the inlay tables and even the roof chandelier. It had an old world charm. The service was slow which I think was due to the place being understaffed and the vibe could have been a tad better with appropriate background music. I wouldn't classify the place romantic or family but it's fine dining with a good flair.",Rated 4.0,20,35,??
P Bhagat,"Rated I love this place the very instance I placed my first step here. The ambience will take you centuries back to an era of rajas and maharajas and you will feel like being one of them. The food is equally fantastic and relishing. I specially came here for rarha and moilee, and they did not disappoint me at all. I accompanied my meal with a Malabar mojito and I must confess that I had a great time here. Only thing I feel which is lacking here is the presence of other cuisines apart from Indian. It is a great place to hang out with friends and family.",Rated 4.0,22,5,??

I had the lamb (legs) which is their house specialty , the dal veda (black lentils very yummy) and a plain nan bread.

And if you happen to love Indian taste in the looks this place food for you. The manager gave us place to sit which was just beside another guests and it was a bit intruding.After denying the request to change the place as the tables were reserved he got us a better place. Beautiful presentation I must say. The dal ? I have never ever had something like that in my life before atleast. It melts in your mouth and heaven feels down your throat.

Gurkiran Singh,"Rated My friends and I had won vouchers for Veda cp and we decided to finally go for a lunch (after a year and a half of planning). The place has a warm ambience and intricate interiors that reflect the style of the owner of the chain of restaurants,Rohit Bal. Food- we ordered dahi kabaabs, tandoori aloo, paneer kundan kalliyan and apricot malai kofta. For the breads, we ordered lachha parathas, garlic naans and oregano naans. Their dahi kababs are simply the best ones I've had so far, full of flavours and gently melt in your mouth. The tandoori aloos can be improved. Paneer kundan kalliyan is again their own version of shahi paneer and they've definitely excelled at that. MUST TRY! The lachha parathas and galric naans are well prepared and worth every rupee you'd spend. Oregano naans can be avoided, unless you really have a taste for it. Drinks- fresh lime sodas, cranberry juice and ice tea. They can work on the non alcoholic menu as nothing really intrigued me there. Still I was satisfied with what I was served. Dessert- Shahi Tukda. MY OH MY. even after all the food we had, the Shahi tukda left us wanting for more. If you go to veda and don't try their Shahi tukda then, I'm sorry, but your visit is nothing but wasted. All in all, I had a great experience and would definitely visit again.",Rated 4.5,6,101,??

We ordered crispy bhindi and apricot malai kofta along with an oregano naan, a butter naan and khasta roti. All of them were simply put delicious. The bhindi was as crisp as it was humanely possible, the apricot kofta was heavenly and the rotis and naan were hot. The waiters were friendly and the speed of service was good.

We were served with a veg pakoda and papad to start off with, on the house (basically to keep you engaged till they prepare your order). We ordered chicken platter for starter.. We also wanted to order chicken tandoori but the waiter was truthful enough to tell us that chicken platter would be enough for the two of us, a huge positive! Negative points about it is they tak We booked a table for 2 at 7 in the evening... Never visited it before so didn't want to take a chance.. Was greeted warmly and given our reserved seats!

Now, it wasn't bad. The guy who took our order was courteous, helpful, polite, but if I have to compare their service to other restaurants in Delhi that are top class, which I am sure they consider themselves to be a part of, then they surely need to work on it, And it's not too difficult either. One briefing by a Manager, a training here and there, and making sure the staff is cheerful and smiling because you pay for the experience, not just for food.

Unfortunately the food does not compliment the mesmerising interiors. Ordered the chicken platter, rarha meat, daal veda, chicken chooza. All the dishes tasted strictly average.

There speciality dish, bhatti murg was off the menu and the waiter suggested us to try tandoori chicken which wasn't cooked right in the tandoor probably as the seasoning on it seemed raw same goes for the fish tikka. Vegetarian starters were just okay. The chicken biryani was like having boiled rice with some unseasoned chicken pieces so we decided to send it back to the chef and the waiter said he would get a better tasting one but even that tasted exactly the same as earlier one, only addition was loads of butter and coriander leaves.

Thankfully there were no long lines even though it was a Friday night. The ambience of the place is top notch. Like that's what sets the place apart. It gives a classy royal rich feeling which very few places in Delhi can give! Coming to the important part, the food. Sadly this is where the place looses some of its sheen. The food it seems is made for foreigners (which By the way were aplenty tonight). The normal spices that you'd expect in north Indian food was just missing somehow. And the roti was a little bit dry! A little bit difficult to bite! But, it isn't awful and I am just being a bit too critical since I had a lot of expectations and I paid a huge shit of money for it. I think it's a must try if you have time and money to spare. The ambience and the feeling you get is unmatchable.

Considering there are not many at CP, we decided to try this out. We ordered Paneer Khurchan, a veg dish on their menu .Menu clearly said it had spring onions in it and that was the primary reason we decided to order it. After a long wait , it finally arrived. It looked like sum mix veg with thin long chopped onions and several other vegetables(I really donno wat all) and no hint of spring onion. We called waiter and enquired same , to our surprise he said that long chopped onion is what they meant as spring onions and not the long thin leaves which actually it is. Anyways without arguing for long , we decided to change our order. Service was very poor no water and spoons arrived untill we requested it that too after a long time. Waiter hardly paid attention to us , in case we needed to order something. Finally we decided to talk to manager to give our feedback. He wasnt available as intimated by staff (quite expected ).We spoke to supposedly senior staff giving our genuine feedback and opinion hoping they would improve in future. Meanwhile staff that was catering to us interrupted and said that dish did not have spring onion as ingredient and he had informed us this thing , on the contrary he had confirmed dish contained spring onions!

Services are alright, nothing extraordinary about them and so was the staff. I ordered a Paneer dish, Bread Basket and Yellow Daal. The food menu is lavish and not much variety is offered, in the vegetarian dishes have a lot of innovative dishes so it can be a risky gamble. So try at your own risk.

Kakori Kabab boasted a lot, but failed to deliver. The Bread Basket served dismal breads; we should have just stuck with rice is what we felt. Nihari was good; aromatic and mildly spiced, a thick rich gravy that gave us some relief. The Biryani is a Matka Biryani, sealed at the top and then cooked.

Sadly other than that nothing was fasicinating. Neither the cutlery. Tables. Menu were upto the design standards ..why such miss match we don't know ..the food was good. Not very good neither great to be honest. The mutton biriyani had a lot of saffron flavor which I think was more to do with the luxurious interior than luxurious flavor...

Veda always gave me a good vibe as i passed by ; the red colored lamps, candle lit dinner and the huge crystal chandeliers adding to the beauty of this place. Complete restaurant interior is done in red and golden, be it the wallpapers, the Antique lanterns or the mirrors hanging on the walls. The interior is pretty inviting and that is why we waited outside for approx 45 mintues, But the wait wasnt worth it! As we sat on a corner table, we noticed stained napkin kept on the table. We waited for someone to attend us for 15 mins, alas! no one turned up to take our order. Finally we called someone who seems already engaged in serving at another table. We noticed they have a severe shortage of staff. Finally after 1 hour of waiting(standing+sitting) we placed the order for both starters and main course .Tried their tandoori aaloo, spring rolls, dahi k kabab, daal makhni and apricot malai kofta along with onion, paneer and mix kulcha. Food was palatable, but the slow service ruined our eve Overall an unpleasant experience.

Pramil Gupta,"Rated Veda. I just became a father and named my bitiya, Vedanshi. Short name ought to be Veda. Was looking for some new place on Zomato for veg, north Indian food, name caught the attention. Location wise good, in the quiter parts of CP and on the main road as well. Entrance a bit odd and presence of the staff helps in identifying which one is the door to be. Lighting soothing but ambience a bit Twilight like. Seating comfortable. Staff decent. Variety is very less. But whatever was there, was goood. Took Spinach Chaat for a licking start and it was quite creative and tasty indeed. Main course- I am a Daal wala, so ordered Dal Veda, Dal Makhani, which it was. But awesome, just superb taste. Paneer Kundan Kaliyan a bit like Shaahi Paneer but Paneer's presentation and treatment itself was quite different, liked it. Roti - Khasta was really Khasta and good. Baby walking time.

Akshay Dhanwani,"Rated Lets just say im pretty impressed with this place. From food to decor to service to menu design to variety of items. It just has it all to be a great restaurant in the capital. Situated where you'd expect the main restaurants to be, connaught place, Veda is placed on the outer circle. It starts with a plus point that it has a hypothetical dedicated parking. Yes, there's enough space to park your car right outside the restaurant. So as your enter this place, you get this royal feeling as if youre entering a huge royal eating mansion with decorative lights and flooring. The whole look and feel of the place takes you for a ride. Something that you can expect in huge eating halls in big forts. Moving on with the decor, next was the food. Served well, served hot and served tasty. Ordered for chicken malai tikka for starters and their no.1 serving dish chicken makhani along with garlic butter naan for the main course. This brings me to the only reason why i'd give this restaurant 4/5 because i was dissapointed with the quantity. 2 butter naans were enough to feed 3 of our hungry souls but one full chicken makhani was just not enough. So I was a little dissapointed with that but otherwise, it all tasted pretty well. One must try to place. A little on the expensive side but worth it.",Rated 4.0,17,174,??
Chaahat Khattar,Rated This is a little overhyped place. No need of prior reservation. It's in a very secluded area so it's better to park Carl exactly in the same circle. As you enter you do get to see lavish decor and you can make out that something is special about it. But looks like Rohit Bal overdid it with mirrors all around. The food is expensive (on a relative scale) and cannot be justified. Ordered North Indian dishes and was disappointed to have spent so much just for ambience.

But, after a while, you start feeling like a player in some period dark movie. Ok, about the food - We ordered mostly north indian fare, and the kadhai paneer and butter naan is among the best we've had in a while. The beverages (fruit shakes) are nothing grand to write about. The papad is a must try. The service was not very fast given that it was a working day and only 6 PM and quite a few people inside.

Raavi Agarwal,Rated Veda is by no means up to the hype created for the restaurant. Starting with the Decor which is too loud as per me. The big mirrors are an overdo with the dark interiors and red light. the service was very average and it took more than 10 min to capture any helpers eye. We gave orders for the drinks and snacks and even after their completion no one took care to ask for main course order. The food was average too. We ordered veg seekh kababs and they were a disappointment: cold and tasteless. Drinks saved the day. But we didn't feel like ordering the main course and left. After the whole ordeal the number of expatriates dining there was a surprise for me. Maybe the service staff was also preferring them. Dunno but Veda would be the last restaurant I would visit again in CP.,Rated 2.5,27,72,??

Piyush Jain,"Rated I have been there a number of times with my family but my last visit disappointed me, both with the food and the attitude of management. I did not refer to the latest reviews on zomato, else would have known that Veda is no more a restaurant where one goes for great food. Ambience : it has a decent ambience. Food : - for starter, we ordered dahi ke kabab and crispy aloo chaat... Both at best can be termed average. For main course we ordered Yellow dal, paneer makhni and breads. Dal was absolutely bland whereas paneer makhni was one of the worst i have ever had. It was so sweet that it spoilt our mood for deserts. When we highlighted this to chef, he was not willing to accept his mistake. This used to be a great restaurant where i have had one of the best dal makhani and biryani. But the place where the chef does not feel guilty about serving a disastrous dish and the waiter is adamant on charging you for a dish which has spoilt our evening, is not worth eating at. Now I would rather go to other better restaurants in the vicinity.",Rated 2.0,15,26,??

Criscrossin,"Rated I am pretty disappointed to report that I didn't like this place. I am tempted to give a 2-2.5 rating but then I hate to run anything down. So 3.0 it is. Saturday night 900 pm, I walked over from Radisson blu marina hotel, just a block apart and found few of the seats vacant; quite unexpectedly. It's a long narrow room, with only one row of seats available on both sides of the central walkway. A long black soft sofa runs along the wall on both sides and small tables are just in front of them with wooden simple chairs on the other side of the tables. Somewhat like a student canteen. At the end are the billing counters with the kitchens and washrooms side by side. But what a kitsch of artifacts around. Reflective mirrors with red and black in different combos from floor to ceiling. Service is fair to bad. The uniforms were routine and somewhat ill fitting. They gather around at the end of the room and chitchat in loud voice. But luckily the music being played in the room is like a disco and tears through your tympanic membranes, hence only occasional loud laughs can slip through from them. One waiter was lazily scratching around his nether parts almost in front of my table while talking to his colleagues. Awesome!! It took all my self control to get up and just leave. The seating arrangement is very close. Need to be careful not to hit the next table or the diner by the odd elbow movement. The diners at my next table were both confused and not too happy - specially when hit by a Rs. 3000 bill and called the waiter for explanation- seems to have had gathered a Rs.800 bill portion in tax only!! The diners at my exact opposite table were so unhappy that they called the Chef with the hat from the kitchen and lots of gesticulations and gestures with long dialogues ensued. But some other tables were peeling with laughters though- I don't know if the mirth was caused by the gastronomic misadventures or not. To be fair, food was delivered quite promptly. But my first order was not available- jumbo prawns! A bit of surprise- thought it was a commonplace item. They got three menus- food, beverage and desserts. The deserts menu was not offered and only parchance I found it out when asking if they had any Desserts. Later I discovered that it also doubled as a bill/ cheque presenting folder. That's why it looked pretty weathered. The table had big dents on the edges which was very prominent in spite of the lights being largely dimmed. Finally the food. Appetizers consisted of 5 pieces of small conical roasted papads with a nondescript orange sauce. Onion rings were heaped haphazardly with black salt sprinkled over- it enhanced the taste, though the presentation was lackadaisical. The amritsari fish were six medium to small fillets- ajwain powder was used and again enhanced the taste, otherwise it was bland. Costed 499.00. The Nehari consisted of one boneless chunk with three mutton pieces with small bones attached. No nalli was found. Never knew that Nehari will be very sweet in taste too. Costed Rs.699.00. Tasted like a mix of mutton curry with Rogan Josh- definitely the Chef trained from a different gharana than where I tasted food from. Only the butter naan was good- soft with a right amount of crispy layer- costing 69.00- it's a big one.The lychee ki tehri was not bad. Small morsels of lychee flesh spread over a thick condensed milk base- costing Rs.295.00. Total cost including a bottle of mineral water of Rs. 75.00 was Rs.2115.00 for one person. In deserving cases I don't mind spending , but this place really is not worth it. Avoid unless you are in a large boisterous group or with a person who will make you forget everything else.",Rated 3.0,241,1117,??

The place is very nicely decorated with mirrors in black frame everywhere. Its a lavish place where I found most visitors to be expatriates. I had appetizers, main course and some mock tails. The biggest drawback I found was most of dishes are sweet in taste, not all spicy. So, if you are going there for a good dine in be prepared for less spicy or sweet food. I found service not so great. My overall experience is the place is little bit more hyped than it deserves.

We ordered dahi kebab, total disaster, wrong texture, extremely bland. The chicken tikka was ordinary, but their hara bhara kebab was pretty good. Main course was the same story, an ode to blandness, perhaps the menu has been prepared with a foreign clientele in mind, my indian taste buds like some spice in their meals.

When we got there I realised why they kept calling....they had a long waiting list. I was surprised to see the rush on a Monday evening. Time to order food and we were surprised that they don't serve soup. Our starter order was amritsari fish, lasooni chicken, some potato dish, some palak dish & paneer tikka. The food was super and nothing to complain about. We ordered beer and it was super chilled and rarely I've found such chilled beer at any restaurant. Time came for main course and order was butter chicken, black dal, some veg dish and jeera rice. The chicken and dal was super tasty. We ordered extra portions. We didn't order dessert as we had 2 cakes. I would have given 4.5 if service was better. Whatever food came to the table was not served and it was a bit tedious to serve ourself from the hot pans.

Vedant Thakur,"Rated it was a one fine evening and i took my fiancee (now my wife) on a dinner date here before marriage. this place was recommended by one of my male colleagues who accidentally ran into it after a romantic rainy monsoon evening in Delhi. as soon as we enter the servers greeted us with smile and happily gave us a nice table on left alley of the restraunt. the seating arrangement is a bit boring and awkward in two parallel lanes. i mean i felt as i have entered some board room only a big round table was missing :). my girl liked the ambiance and was happy to see mirros at the wall which were imbibing blush in her every now and then whenever she found me watching her through them. the tea lights in shot glasses were spreading golden aura around us and giving us a feeling of dining in heaven. she was a bit shy in ordering for her, thankfully i knew her likes, kakori kababs, dahi ke kababs, jumbo prawns. we were in no mood to have main course as we did not wanted to waste our evening just in eating.. but i could see in her eyes that she was not yet satisfied with portions (being the food as my first love and and her lethal shyness, she could nt eat properly) hence we ordered main course. we ordered a missi roti and a pudina parantha with Prawn Biryani, rarha meat. i was delighted to see that now she was eating with complete concentration and i had my concentration on her. it was evening of a time, we visited this place again on first anniversary but that first time charm and her cute shyness was all gone. yet a pink blush was still there. In all of this i could only remember is that she licked her fingers - which means that food was obviously authentic and aromatic Thank you Veda for giving me the memories of my lifetime!",Rated 4.0,23,30,??

Samay Thapa,"Rated Just went last night with my friends for a belater birthday get together. The moment we entered i was like ""Nice"" coz the decor is really pleasing. Its not really that big but the way they have designed is really attractive. Now talking about the drinks, the girls ordered smoothies (Apricot-Peach and Kiwi) which they really liked. We guys just had beer which was lager (they only serve lager). With this we had Chicken Malai Tikka, Tandoori Mushroom, Tulsi Paneer Tikka and Tandoori chicken. The appetizers tasted really good and extremely well cooked. I do not eat mushrooms but surprisingly i loved it and had it! For maim course we ordered 2 Dal Vedas, Some paneer dish (weird named), Mutton rogan josh, Mutton Nihari, Chicken Korma, Mutton Biryani and Veg Biryani. After having the tasty appetizers i was confident that the food also will be yum yum and indeed it was! Mutton won my heart all the way! Biryani was amazing, Mutton Nihari was wow and Rogan josh was yummy!. Did not even look at the veg dishes, lol. Overall, the visit was a real pleasure. The service was also really nice. We were 10 ppl and every single person was satisfied. I just wish they had big washrooms coz its only for ""one at a time"" use.

Waseem Ali Khan,Rated Took my fiance out to this place for her birthday. As we entered the place we were welcome by a friendly staff and a nice ambience of a dimly lit interior. The walls r red and black and there are antique shandeliers and wall hangings. The set up of the place however looks like a dining mess. The tables are lined up in two rows in two straight lines n there is no room for privacy of having a seperate table. On all the tables there are candles. It gives a good feel of a candle light dinner. We ordered bindi masala and the waiter truthfully gave the suggestion to order something else as bhindi masala is too dry. So we ordered the highly suggested veda dal. Food came in fast. Food was excellent and upto the price mark. The quantity was too generous and we asked them to parcel whatever we could not eat. Amount came to 1800 for two people. I will visit this place definitely but only for a special occasion.,Rated 4.0,2,12,??

I was so in awe of the place that I never visited Veda but once I got over the ambience and started to focus on the food I really enjoyed what I had ordered. The first thing we ate was, Rogan Josh and Shahi Korma. Now I love wazwan and I am a big fan of Rogan Josh. I have been to many muslim weddings courtesy my friends and I have enjoyed the most authentic wazwan in Kashmir. This was just as good as good can be. I was very impressed with the taste and the aroma. This was a great accompaniment to the chicken and lamb dum biryani, we ordered both as there were 6 of us dining. We have to say we all loved the restaurant and if we hadn't spent Rs. 2000 per head we would surely go back really soon. The service was quite good too.

Ankur,"Rated In spite of reading a lot of negative reviews about the service, I decided to try out Veda for lunch with my office team. This is one of the expensive restaurants of Connaught Place. It was absolutely empty when we arrived, yet not one waiter came for a long time. The service staff seemed absolutely disinterested in attending. And most irritatingly, they spoke English in an affected American accent. When we asked for normal water instead of bottled water, one of the waiters serving us kept on acting as if he did not understand what normal water and bottled water is. Were these blokes hired from US! You don't come to an expensive restaurant to encounter staff like this. We ordered makhani chicken, mutton nahari,daal veda , veg biriyani n bread basket. The daal veda was very nice and the tastiest fare in the whole spread. veg biriyani was average. But he non veg dishes were really disappointing. mutton nahari was avarage, while makhani chicken, which they labeled their '#1 seller' was an insipid version of butter chicken. Average food, above average prices and most importantly some of the most irritating service staff considering the customer service one would expect of a similarly priced restaurant ...

I think its very important for the MANAGEMENT RESPONSE team to hire more educated and groomed staff rather than spending time apologising with no real ground work done - 19th april today went for a dinner with 8 of my close family members, meeting them for the first time as they are settled in London and wanted to have an Indian food experience with a nice ambience and authentic food. Well - one person spoils the image/food/ambience of the whole place, the staff is literally abusive on asking for two servings of papad on a table of 8. Thankfully for the foreigners flocking the place they wouldn't really understand. But it was a shameful experience for me and as far as Food is concerned , the least i expect is to be having it around people with smiling/helpful and cheerful nature.

I guess both....!! We took our clients to this place yesterday, even though the entrance is not as pleasing as it could be, once you enter, the aura of the entire place created by Rohit, impresses u immensely...!!

The staff n the service failed to deliver. As I said earlier, I think it's something to do with CP's restaurants...!! The attitude, the service standards, the managers over eagerness to share Gordon brown's instances (we finally had to request him to leave), it all just ruined the perfect experience...!!

For main course we simply stuck with their signature black dal, crispy bhindi and roti. The bhindi is highly recommended. We finished a wonderful with shahi tukra as dessert. This was the only disappointment. Texture of the shahi tukra was a little wierd. The atmosphere is casual dinning. Veda boasts of an interesting decor and a great place for dinner with friends and family but wont recommend it for a romantic evening.

Service was ok , staff wasn't as royal as the place, I am sure they can afford to be little more pleasant and welcoming. We ordered yellow dal, apricot malai kofta, paneer kundan kaliyan and the bread basket. At first when the order arrived we were slightly taken a back by the portion size of each dish. Yellow dal was to die for and amazingly each dish was so heavy on the palate. Everything was prepared royally . Though small portion size but very heavy, paneer kulcha and onion kulcha was again nice and went very well with the dal. The paneer dish was good too, however the sweetness can be brought down a notch, the malai koftas were very heavy with nice gravy. Dal being my favorite. Beautiful place, nice food, ok staff.

Raj K Sekhar,"Rated A friend had been recommended about Veda, and we end up here for dinner. We landed at around 9 without a prior reservation. We had to wait for around 20 minutes, after which we were ushered in. I have to appreciate what I noticed - that there were people who had come after us trying to get in through favouritism and bribing, but the staff were adamant not to let them in. Wonderful. We walk in to find a spectacular and majestic ambience - mirrors all around, chandeliers, dim lighting, and grand tables and chairs. I thought this place we witnessed was just a section, but it was the entire restaurant. The place is pretty small, and they have done a great job with the ambience. Candles placed on the table added to the decor, albeit without the space between the tables that should be providing privacy. Promptly handed the menu, we scourge through it slowly but ravenously as our appetites build up. The menu is not large in any aspect; a bit of a put off actually. Almost all the items were common, without much variation in the description from what you are used to. So, frankly put, nothing excited us. We go ahead and order a Chicken Platter, Kakori Kabab, a Mutton Biryani, a Bread Basket and a Mutton Nihari. Now let me be frank. There is no superlative adjective that I can suffix to the food served here. The food was completely average. The Chicken Platter had assorted Tandooris and Kababs, all of them just fine; there was no juicy flavour oozing from the meat nor was the aroma scintillating. The presentation, the chutney, etc. were just meaningless adornments if the main matter is not what it was supposed to be. Kakori Kabab boasted a lot, but failed to deliver. The Bread Basket served dismal breads; we should have just stuck with rice is what we felt. Nihari was good; aromatic and mildly spiced, a thick rich gravy that gave us some relief. The Biryani is a Matka Biryani, sealed at the top and then cooked. Chefs at Veda seem to take their spices really mild; I do not mean the 'hotness' factor that comes with Chillies, but the spices altogether in the Biryani, which was so less, the Biryani seemed like aromatic rice. But the masala of the meat was good and the meat was actually perfectly cooked. The Biryani turned out to be a 50/50 dish in ratings. Service was good, for the responsiveness from the waiters was appreciable. The rates, as I believe CP encounters heavy rent, is justified; otherwise it definitely is not for the quality of food being served. An experience that was not bad in any aspect, but just utterly disappointing. It is actually strange that the only reason being the food and nothing else. A great place to spend your dinner with family and loved ones if food is not the main detail.",Rated 2.5,157,1436,??

Because one of the friends had heard good reviews about the place, so all of us agreed to her suggestion and went to veda with some expectations. But I must say it failed to meet up to our expectations. The service was pathetic. The food was not worth of what it is priced at. The food was average...not that great When we were about to leave we even spotted a mouse running there in the dining hall!

Had to ask waiters for petty things like Pudina chutney, this is something which is served by default, but had to ask them specifically and got it when I was already half way done with the food.

It was new with mushroom stuffed in chicken! And the curd just gave a perfect balance to the chicken. For the mains, Butter chicken and Dal Veda were equally scrumptious.

But that's it. Half a star off for the ambiance. But the rest is just pure brilliance. The food is amazing. Really, really amazing. I love their crispy bhindi. I'm not a huge bhindi fan, but their crispy bhindi is terrific! I could eat a whole bowl as an appetizer, without any accompaniments. Their matar methi malai and dal veda is also pretty good. And the garlic naan is one of the best garlic naans I've had. For desserts, try the shahi tukda. I have no words for how delicious it is. There are times when I dream about it - it's that good.

Niharika.Loves.To.Eat,"Rated I first tried Veda at DLF Promenade, Vasant Kunj and clearly disliked it. From taste to service, I found the restaurant deeply flawed. Although the food does disappoint one to an extent, this joint located in the Outer Circle of Connaught Place is marginally better than the other. Here's how : The ambience, although similar to the South Delhi outlet, is slightly better for the lighting is not too dim and therefore reading the menu is not a problem. Moreover, the hues of orange and red are slightly softer than the jarring yellow and green in the other one. Further, the music is softer and a lot livelier too. As for the crowd, well, there are hardly any, but the handful that I spotted on a weekend seemed to be a part of the upbeat strata of diners in the city. So +1 there And the service, well, definitely better. While the servers at the other outlet dropped servings on my clothes, here, they take good care of their customers. My server was polite and well mannered. Also sound with the menu and cared to make suggestions. Further, I liked the way he served the wine. Intent! The way he held the glass was as fine as servers in the West do. It blew me away. So +1 there! However, the food was a disappointment, like before. This time I thought of trying something other than the lamb steak which I did, twice earlier. Instead, I ordered the Burra Kebabs and the Parmesan kulcha. While the kebabs lacked seasoning and flavors and were a little too bland for my liking, the kulcha was dry and a little too brittle ! I had to chug a few pegs to dissolve the big chunk stuck in my throat ! -2 there. As for the drinks menu, yes that is vast. After trying some incredible drinks in the Promenade outlet, I was bold enough to experiment here as well and yes that was a good choice. They make really good cocktails. The quantity of alcohol in one glass is amazing. One LIIT can probably equal the buzz of two or maybe more. I had two and I knew I was tippin'. +3 there! Fabulous is the word. Others : The parking is a pain in any corner of Connaught Place and this one is no exception. The restaurant is conveniently located, though, and so finding it is not hard. The pricing is above average and a meal for two which includes two food items and 6 drinks cost us about Rs. 5800. So slightly expensive. Don't go for the food. Rest, all fine",Rated 3.0,441,6711,??

Bharti Bedi,"Rated Veda -- NEVER AGAIN! The reason we decided to go to Veda was to celebrate. My colleague had received a complimentary voucher for the place for being an outstanding employee and she graciously decided to treat us to dinner. We were three of us and thought the Rs 2500 gift voucher would cover our meal. We decided to make reservations online and filled out the extensive form on their website. However, the only response we got was an automatic reply to the mail. We headed out in the evening, nonetheless. The ambiance and decor were pleasant but we were struck by the rudeness of the staff the moment we told them about our voucher. The waiter's attitude was off putting and we wish he would have consulted his superiors first before giving us weird looks. We may not have been white-skinned like many other customers there but we surely did not deserve a second-class treatment. There was no fixed waiter for a table and we were being served by at least 4 different waiters, further bringing the service quality down. Since the food is ridiculously over priced, we were asked to pay over and above what was covered with the voucher. This, after waiting for 15 minutes for the bill. The bill had another story to it. They had merrily charged us two different prices for the same dish that we had ordered twice (yes, the crispy bhindi is good, but the dining experience ruins it all). On questioning, they said that the prices had been revised and so there was a difference of Rs 100 in the two. Firstly, we were not informed of any revised rates. Secondly, all other items on the bill were charged according to the ""old"" menu prices. Rather than being apologetic, the staff was extremely defensive and rude. We were handed over the revised bill as if they were doing us a favour. It is not that we could not have paid the extra Rs 100, but we were in no mood to be generous for such bad service. I wish Veda improves their management structure and order and teach their staff some manners and courtesy. When you are paying four times the money for a dish, you expect it is served to you nicely. I could have commented on the food as well, but it is not worth it and I am in no mood to visit the place ever again.",Rated 2.0,4,6,??

Prerita Chugh,"Rated The ambience of Veda exemplifies opulence and grandeur to the core. It is meant to pamper and enchant you. Designed by the ever so famous fashion designer, Rohit Bal, he extends his creative prowess to his latest endeavor, Fine Dining and as expected, he leaves no stone unturned. Be it the plush leather sofas or the chandeliers and the sparkling bar, every inch is spectacular. The interiors of Veda are a medley of Soft Lighting, Low hung Crystal Chandeliers, extravagant use of mirrors, red, gold and black hues, intricate carvings on the roof and oodles of attention to detail. As we entered, we were flanked by tables to our left and right and a bar at the end of the room. We were a gathering of 4 people and were very courteously seated on a table for 4. Till the time we admired the ambience and looked around, we were handed the menu card. Veda specializes in North Indian and Mughlai cuisine. It has a decent variety of food on the menu, enough to satiate the whims of people. Owing to conflicting interests of the 4 of us, we decided to settle for the platters - Lamb Platter, Chicken Platter and Veg Platter. For drinks, we ordered LIITs for everyone. Our food took a good 30 minutes to arrive. They served the complimentary papads and mint chutney. We had asked them to bring our drinks first hence we sipped on the LIITs in the meantime while munching on Papad. The LIIT was good. Nothing phenomenal or class apart. Just good old comforting LIIT. The food that arrived boasted splendid presentation and quantities too, I must say. The platters were good sized and the grins on our face made it evident that we were geared up to hog every last morsel. The Lamb Platter had Barra kebabs, Seekh, Lamb Chops and a couple of other things. Everything was well cooked. With all the spices just apt. The consideration they gave to food was evident and we were more than happy with the fact that Veda was not just about resplendent interiors, but wonderful food too. The Lamb Chops was what stood out. They were lovely. Little cubes of Lamb, marinated and cooked to perfection and were simply melt in the mouth. I found the seekh a little less spicy, but that, I'd attribute to the already overpowering spices of the Barra Kebabs; which were excellent. The Chicken Platter consisted of Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Seekh, Chicken Tikka and another dish that I couldn't name. I have eaten better Tandoori Chicken and Tikka. But they were great given the standards of fine dining. Though everything chicken was prepared very well, but the Lamb Platter takes away the prize and when I go back in there, I would prefer to order the Lamb Platter. Now, coming to the Veg Platter. I was not really impressed by it. It was huge. It was a mish-mash of vegetables. There was Paneer Tikka, Tandoori Aloo and Broccoli, Vegetable Seekh Kebab and Tandoori Salad. The Paneer Tikka was a fine preparation. With the mint sauce sandwiched between two slices. The Broccoli and the Tandoori Salad was very regular. The mushrooms in the salad were marvellous though. Eat only if you cannot have anything else on the menu. Even our vegetarian companion was not so happy with the salad-ish contents of the platter. We were just about content with the quantity we had eaten. But for the sake of our vegetarian companion, who was pretty disheartened with the vegetable platter, we decided to order the Dal Veda and the Onion and Parmesan Kulcha (So, they have been inspired by ""Dal Bukhara"" in naming their dish; could have come up with a better name) Dal Veda was their version of Dal Makhani. It was rich and creamy and buttery and slurpy and had it not been for the lamb and chicken I had just devoured, I would have lapped it up happily. The Onion and Parmesan Kulcha was a crackerjack. It was incredibly soft and could be eaten in itself too. A must try over the regular butter naans and lachhaa paranthas. From the beginning, I could feel the service lacking. First, I thought I was just being unreasonable But it started reflecting clearly and my humble companions commented on it too. The waiters were more interested in serving the foreigners who occupied most of the other tables in the restaurant. We requested them for a second serving of Mint Chutney and onions and they brought it to our table only after the second reminder and till then, we had already finished eating. I hope they improve upon this and start taking their 'service' aspect of the restaurant seriously. Veda is ideal for most occasions! Especially when you are looking to cast an awesome impression. Prices can be a setback. But then luxury and indulgence come at a price :)",Rated 4.0,93,2381,??

The interiors of this restaurant are hard to miss, black and red with mirrors sprawled across the walls, personally, I feel it was too tacky and loud. Its confusing if this place is meant for a sit-down dining experience because it gave the impression of turning into a bar/private party location on other days. (I went on a Sunday night) The music was mediocre (but I hear on other nights its much better). As for the food, definitely worth a try. We had the Mughlai: Chicken Biryani and Daal. Also, a must try is the Onion and Parmesan Kulcha, an absolute delight. The quality of food was great and the quantity was abundant.

Abhishek,"Rated Good food in an otherwise garish decor which overpowers everything else is how I'd define this place Veda. Unlike the outfits he designs that are linearly patterned and rarely non-synchronized, this place rescinds the general perception about Rohit Bal by being an exception to his hitherto impressive aesthetic sense. The food is undoubtedly good, as is the service and the staff employed there but I reckon the idea of imparting a rather dark and extravagantly loud touch to the place while keeping it very open defeats the basic concept of comfortable fine dining, giving it a feel that bears a close resemblance to a Hukkah house straight from the medieval Persia (or a dining hall from Harry potter movies with an Indo-Persian feel to it, as defined by a friend). The food is a revelation of sorts, right from the soups, starters, main course and desserts. A special mention for shrimp soup which has such a great complexity of flavours, it is bound to leave you bedazzled at the culinary expertise of the chef. Khasta Kebabs are very tasty and so is Dum Dahi Murg with Mushroom stuffing which is not something you get everywhere. A must try. For the main course, we ordered crispy Okra that was a slight drop from the starters but they almost made up for that with superb Gazala Mutton, which seemed like a close cousin of Irani style Mutton. Do try their Kandahari Kulcha and Warqi Paratha which is essentially a layered Paratha, an old Delhi specialty. These go well with both, dry as well as gravy items. Coming to the service, it was quite prompt throughout our stay there with the attendant visits at the table timed immaculately well leaving no scope for any criticism for the same. There are not many options available for desserts at Veda but the selected few that they have are enough to satiate the sweet tooth tendencies. Litchi Ki Tehri isn't just a Chef's special but also a favorite among the regulars I was told. One may also try the cocktail Falooda which isn't extraordinary but a nice change from the regular Faloodas. Veda is a suitable place if you're planning a dine-out with expat friends or wish to introduce the Indian cuisine to a group in an opulent setting. The prices are on the higher side and the food, although good, does not really justify the money spent here. 3/5",Rated 3.0,26,85,??
Arushi Arora,"Rated I think it's the most tastefully done up restaurant in Delhi. Though I went there with family, I think it's a must visit for couples as the soft lighting, beautiful mirrors and majestic chandeliers complete with the old world sofas add up to the cozy ambiance. The food is great, their crispy Okra and Garlic Naan being my favorite. Service is mostly quick and courteous.",Rated 4.0,25,226,??

Desmond John,"Rated The word Veda means 'Knowledge' in Sanskrit, and this place definitely offers a learning experience. Rohit Bal has done well to keep his baby in the realms of fantasy, and the place reminds you of the grandeur of Vedic architecture. It is bewitchingly ornate in it's decor and the soft lighting casts you into an enchanting world where traditional meets contemporary. The ornate mirrors, candles, chandeliers and soft lighting make it a nice place for romantic dinners or family outings. Soft sofas line the walls while hard backed chairs line the central aisle. If you look up, you will notice the domed roof that is adorned with hundreds of tiny mirrors that reflect light all over the place. We were in for dinner yesterday, and we ordered Paneer Kaliyan, Crispy Bhindi, Zaffrani Subzi Pulao, Plain Naans and Green Salad. The order was served in 15 minutes and the quantity was quite sufficient for 3 people with normal appetites (maybe not for heavy eaters). The Crisp Bhindi was dusted with Chaat Masala and tasted good. Rice was served in a steaming pot and had a lot of veggies. The Paneer had a nice grainy texture, while the Naans were soft. All this was washed down by Classic LIIT (instead of their version), Fresh Lime Soda and Diet Cokes. By the end of the meal we felt so full that we had to leave some Crispies and gravy, and even turned down dessert. We had just 2 negatives through out the lovely evening -- The major grouse was that the AC was turned off and the place was quite warm (had too ask twice to start it) and the minor grouse was that we asked to meet the manager (Mr. Patrick) many times but he never came and we were later told that he had left for the day. Oh ! One more thing - traditional or semi-classical Indian music would have matched the ambiance perfectly (instead of Carpenters and English oldies). Service was good and our server Mukesh was a smiling and helpful chap. The food is tasty (nothing too extraordinary) and the prices are on the higher side as this restaurant caters to the upper levels. Kids are welcome but they also have a separate section for patrons who don't want to be disturbed by the little ones. Highly recommended ! facebook.com",Rated 4.0,179,1215,??

Himanshi Chaudhary,"Rated Veda exudes the personality of the person responsible for it. Rohit Bal has brought concrete to life, at Veda. I just absolutely adore the decor. The motifs on the walls, the innumerable mirrors looking down at you, the chandeliers on the ceiling, the Maharaja sofas and the aromatic food speak volumes of the grandeur. Everything about Veda is top notch! The food is finger licking good, the service is ever so courteous and I really needn't say more about the ambiance. A great place for all occasions. Come, splurge, dine and wine. It may be a petite review, but it speaks volumes of my admiration for this place. Highly recommended.",Rated 4.0,17,51,??
Mohit Gupta,"Rated I have been visiting this place quite frequently & to be frank I quite like the place. Ambance: The moment you enter the restaurant it mesmerizes you with it's great ambiance & class. Interiors are very nicely done, be it the antique chandelier, lighting, colors & specially those big mirrors. All this adds to the magnificent ambiance. Food & Drinks: Food we ordered arrived pretty much in time & I just loved those crisp butter naans & curries. The mocktails/ drinks they serve are nothing special than the others but quite enjoyable. Service: Service was pretty good & i was satisfied. Staff is courteous too & they make sure you enjoy your food in your own way. Conclusion: Alhough a little expensive, Veda has a variety to offer. I recommend it.",Rated 4.0,2,17,??

Vinni,"Rated I have been to this place several times now. Interestingly enough, one of my friends once described this place as a great option when you are out with a big group having wide ranging cuisine preferences. He was probably right given that this place serves everything. Food & Drinks: Although there is great variety available. Chettinad Chicken is good as well. Drinks are surprisingly overpriced and nothing special. Ambiance: The decor is good. Service: Service is usually good and prompt although there were a couple of waiters who seemed to be quite disgruntled for no discernible reason. Value for Money: Good value on food generally.",Rated 3.0,80,488,??
Varun Gupta,"Rated The food at veda's in terms of taste 5* +++. Must try is Paneer Kundan Kalian, Veg Seekh and Kandhari Kulcha. The food here at veda's was the the best I have ever tasted, however still I gave a 3* star. Being a hotlier myself I was initially annoyed with ants crawlling on the table. A reason to be upset, however when the food came, it was the best I had ever experienced (ever restaurants in 5* hotels). The portion size is a little less, however the taste of the food substitutes for the same. A professional approach to the service part can be inproved. A place must visit for foodies!! and of cource for the interior designers!!",Rated 4.0,41,31,??
Deepak Arora,Rated visited this place last night.Its not a very huge place but roof is really a masterpiece of rohit bal on the other hand floor is in real bad shape and as far as the food is concerned i was disappointed had heard of this place alot but it was nowhere near its name.We ordered a mix veg for which they have there own name ofcourse but it was very close to pathetic our second dish a paneer was making up for it and we were just able to have our dinner so over all not a second time place at all.,Rated 2.0,8,5,??
Brian Simpson,"Rated I loved Veda. I was visiting Delhi from Toronto, Canada back in 2008 and it was recommended to me. The food was good, but not fantastic, but the decor and ambiance were unlike anything I've experienced before.

Nakul Gupta,"Rated The place is nicely designed and gives you ethnic cum cozy feelings, specially light effects, flooring is dull and table is also not that appealing. Coming to food, taste is good but nothing too special and serving is also normal. High price is due to ambiance and Rohit Bal tag. Things to improve: waiters could have more warmth and pro active in serving, serving dishes could be changed. Liquor is a bit expensive.",Rated 3.0,3,8,??
Vikas Grover,"Rated I had earlier visited the one in promenade which was quite impressive. The one at CP is one big rectangular hall converted beautifully into a visually appealing restaurant. The candle lit tables add to the ambiance, making it a romantic place to dine. The food is quite good the only let down is service from the person at front door to getting the bill. Then had to ask for the food menu twice. The food was served quick but the overall service lacked warmth. Veda is expensive compared to other places and interiors are nicely made up. Only issue is that they need to raise their service standards.",Rated 3.0,17,24,??

Manasvi Sharma,"Rated The moment you take that first step towards Veda you know you are in for an utter surprise. The look on your face will be gobsmacked. The decor is something out of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland with almost a goth touch to it. The lighting is dark and dim.The golden creepers, high up on the ceiling, along with the touch of glass in the shades of red is worth a watch. The decor is no doubt an absolute delight. It looks expensive and designer and the feel is very classy. The place has high, button cushioned old era King's throne chairs that gives the place a very 18th century feel to it. The waiting staff along with the Matre D' exude confidence and efficiency. The drinks menu is extensive and on the lines of high end society. The wines are the best of them all. It is very rare to find a wine menu in an Indian restaurant and it comes as a welcoming surprise. That being said, the food is not worth much of a holler. It is centralized in the Indian cuisine but it seems a little over the top and not very sumptuous. The servings are huge and don't really excite your taste buds. The best part of the whole restaurant though is the bar. It is big, wooden and shiny. It reminds you of the Irish Bars but with a little panache. All in all it is a place worth visiting.",Rated 3.0,2,2,??

The exquisitely crafted and almost overwhelming ambiance leaves you speechless for a moment and it takes you a while to get acclimatized to the grand central dome, the candle lit ceilings, the vibrant colours, the huge mirrors , and the palace like artifacts. The food is good, pretty good but nothing spectacular. They allow you to sample a couple of dishes as well and ask for an honest feedback. The service is decent and the crowd classy. I have been visiting this place for a while now and would definitely suggest you to do so but keeping in mind the potential hole in your pocket that can be dug. But then again it's like watching the fashion week from the front row rather than your television sets, if you know what I mean.",Rated 4.0,61,3326,??

They advised us the right dishes which would suit her taste eg. less spicy etc. I could see the manager going up to every table to check if the food was good. The decor is very ""palace"" like. Good use of mirrors , glass and lights. The volume of the music is perfect to allow conversation. Indeed, it turned out to be authentic Indian food.",Rated 4.0,4,39,??
