Somya Pandey,"Rated This place is the new in Connaught Place which opened recently. If I want to use the word Amazing, I would use it for this place. Now, coming on to the food I had here. We had few Tandoori Chicken Salad , Ricotta,Pine Nut,Raisin Ravioli ,Golden Prawns and Panko Fish Bites there. All the Dishes are tasted really good and they looked very presentable.",Rated 4.5,15,17,??
Ashish Gautam,"Rated The most awaited launch of the year in CP of such a fine establishment was indeed memorable. The place is huge, way huge considering its location. It has a vast open air dining area and equally big closed one. In both of them the ambiance is good with bright white and vibrant colors outside and elegant wood theme decor inside. There is also a dedicated smoking are in backyard which itself is impressively big. In all the decor is good but still has scope for further improvement. Now coming to service which was most questionable thing during the launch. They initially went into some trouble but managed it smartly and later, made up for it real well. That is why it is said, patience always breeds sweet result. As the place is new they should work well to build up a strong customer base and they are indeed doing it well. In drinks I tried sangrias which were well made and tamasha special which was a vodka based cocktail fused with cranberry juice and maple syrup. In food there are a variety of cuisines they serve but according to me the north indian here is indeed having a clear edge over others. They served me one of the most flavorous chicken biryani with heavy yet balanced and adequately harmonised spices which are sure to impress any fan of good blend of spices in his food. Dal was also impressive and so was butter chicken. Beyond this cuisine the thai red curry was also delectable and even better than many restaurants serving asian as their highlight. Pita and hummus is another thing recommended here. The starters though were not in same league as main course but were still good in their own preparations. Desserts were also acceptable. In all the food is excellent and deserves good appreciation. In all this place is highly recommended for its multi layered beautiful ambiance and good food. My Rating: 1. Food: 4.25/5 2. Ambiance: 4/5 3. Service: 3.75/5 4. Value of Money: 4/5 neverknowsbest.in",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Nalin,"Rated After the much awaited Launch party of Tamasha, a never seen before stand alone restaurant property in the heart of Delhi, KG Marg, CP we were there for a sit down meal with friends next day. The launch party was truly commendable with the best crowds and service. We really enjoyed the meal service at the amazing Tamasha terrace and one could see and take pictures with the Tricolour, the Indian flag too! The music is not to be missed.

Ridhi Arora,"Rated Another new place to hang out in cp, however this one failed to impress me! Not only was it unorganised and waiters seemed confused about the menu items, but there were several items listed on the menu which weren't available- now that's not cool! Ambience no doubt is great and the terrace top is where I sat both the times I visited this place. I figured the place had a theme of all black - I might be wrong - but the plates were black, tissues were black, seating was in black and blue, waiters were dressed in all black. Seating confusion- We had a reservation and on arriving we were given an inside seating, we however insisted on an open seating - which we were refused to, although we saw that the terrace was not fully occupied and we could get a seating there! Total chaos in terms of that I would say - wasted atleast 30 mins in that. Food- menu looks different and interesting. Names of the dishes are well thought of. We ordered: 1. Tandoori quesada bites - which was a naan having a stuffing if chicken in it - served with three types of dips - tasted bland! Did not quite like it 2. Tikka tasters - 2 types of chicken tikka - tasted ok, chicken seemed a little hard though 3. Kadhai Paneer nachos - nothing more than normal nachos few of which were topped with some paneer makhani gravy 4. Paneer bao 65 - tasted horrible!!! Returned it, asked the chef if this is how it's supposed to be - reply YES - suggestion - please remove from the menu!! (It was basically balls of maida filled with paneer bhurji which tasted bland and maida was undercooked and stuck to the mouth) 5. Arabic chicken sandwich bites - chicken sub - tasted good 6. Red sauce pasta - probably the only thing which was delicious 7. Thai spring roll - dripping with oil - like literally Pizza and dimsums were not available. Cocktails were not available Waiters were shabbily dressed, often seeing pointing out at the guest too Sangria was bad! They didn't have Bira either Sorry but hugely disappointed with the kind of service provided, and the food options as well. The only thing good was the valet parking system and the terrace ambience.",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

We complained the manager also about it and was shocked to hear his reply - "" sir do din pehle he khula he thoda time lagega routine aane me"". I was there on valentines day with my wife and the food and the services just turned us off. Even they added extra item in the bill.

Vishi Khandelwal - EnticingFoodCruise,"Rated Invited for the bloggers meetup, I became part of 50 odd bloggers launch that happened over the weekend. Located on the KG Marg (Outer periphery of the CP Outer Circle), this is a huge standalone property. The place has a huge Open Air seating all set up with white and grey couches with a long and masculine truck which was has been converted into a bar. Sounds interesting and looks fabulous too. The interiors of the one story building is impressive too. The ground floor of which has been left undone with raw bricks and unplastered walls. The natural daylight seeping in through the huge arched Windows was indeed amazing, which essentially gave the place a retro and rustic feel. Climb up the stairs will take you to the first floor with a similar but small seating area and further climb up would make you witness to amesome views of the fluttering Indian Flag and the Statesmen house on the other side. All this excitement could lead to huge disappointment, never thought so. The entire meetup went awry after I witnessed 20 odd people crashing on a single portion of the dish, as the food came after 45 minutes of waiting and moreover the service was super duper slow which resulted in huge disappointments all over. Thankfully got the opportunity to taste a couple of bad starters New Way Caprese and Beetroot Roulade with the former one tasting like a jelly tomato ketchup and the latter one being a Beetroot thing with cheese to go along. Could hardly gulp them in. Got to taste single bite of a Malabar parantha. The Mocktail weren't great either, firstly the choices were limited and over that average Mocktails killed the party completely. Easily gauging that I can't review basis the food snachted from the waiters hand or taking a bite from somebody's else table. However I could see better service and food being served at other tables which were apparently more esteemed guests for the restuarent. Could not have been worse than moving outside in the open air and not being cared to serve by any server despite asking a couple of times. Rude behaviour, bad service and disappointing hospitality from Tamasha clearly destroyed my precious Saturday.",Rated 1.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Tushar Vaidya,"Rated I was called for a foodie meet to tamasha last Saturday. I had been super excited for this place to open up and it didn't disappoint. The place is aptly conceived according to it's name. It has multiple outdoor seating areas, one at the front and a couple at the back as well. One of the only places to have a separate hookah counter. I really liked that idea. The indoor seating faces a huge bar and has been done tastefully. The food was delicious and the chef and management seems to have put in a lot of effort to put together an amazing quirky yet lip smacking, fusion oriented menu. We tried the braised butter chicken, baked butter chicken penne pasta, their dal makhni and chicken biryani. Everything was top notch and oozing flavor and aroma. We stuck to red and white sangria's and their tamasha special cocktails. The red sangria could have been much better. Had tiramisu for dessert, which again was spectacular. Service was welcoming but a little slow. Although, the place was over crowded. I'm sure on a normal day their service would be prompt. All in all, tamasha is one of the most happening places to have come up in Connaught place recently. So I suggest you let your hair down and dance the night away at tamasha the next chance you get. :)",Rated 4.5,22,181,??

Giant American Truck Bar is the first thing you notice and its amazing ,specially in the evenings. Liquor is quit pocket friendly but they don't have most of them in their inventories. Food menu needs to be a bit more customized. Very Disappointed by the service.

I asked more than 3 servers to repeat the beer but i guess stags are given less importance and my beer was not repeated and thus i had to ask for my bill which came in two minutes.

Sharadh R D Sharma,"Rated #Tamasha #Safarnama What else you want, when you are accompanied by #friends #food #Drinks and overall a place where you can hangoutzs with them. Arguably the best outdoors in an around Cp or can say in Delhi overall. Just wow This new entrants in Cp area is having 3 sections , Outdoor, Inner lounge and Rooftop from where u can see the CP outer circle and the Statement house. Outdoors section has a truck on the left hand side The Optimud Prime Truck Bar, once you enter the compound bang straight is the heaven for #Sheeaha lovers a seprate section with lots of variety. Trust me it won't disappointed u at all, Must Have Tamasha offers a multi cusine range from Continental to Indian, Mexican to Italian, a perfect blend. Talking about Food as a vegetarian we tried Dahi ke kebab which was soft & yumm, Paneer tikka Bothe version were just to gud, Cheese nachos were excellent. Beetroot roulade & Veg Dimsums along with new way caprese were just ok Types, personally i am not Dimsums fan so u can give a try yourself. My fellow Non veg friends like the Amritsari style fish, chilli chicken and mutton seek kebab. Chicken chettinad with Malabari Porantha which was super hit dat steal the show for them. In the main course Daal makhni, Veg Briyani, along with assorted Indian breads and pasta U must have as an vegetarian, highly recommend. I tried all the Mocktails and like 3 to tango and virgin apple mojito. Tamasha all d way. Thanks Suchana Bera Rahul Batra & specially #VetaRatra Veta Ratra for all the Hospitality .

Amit Talwar,"Rated Undoubtedly a mind blowing place. Tamasha gives a casual ambience yet its very classy . Just the sight of the Optimus bar( Massive American real truck) took me back to my US days. I sat in the outside area for a couple of hours and dint feel like getting up ,Beautiful weather combined with excellent cocktails and the sight of the bar to die for. The music was more iike a lounge in Ibiza which kept me in that area for an extra hour. For the food i could never imagine that i ""l get to eat Calamari in Chaat,,,was simply yummy. Also the Biryani,,,where on earth one would infuse Vodka maintaining the original Biryani Flavours of cardamom n clove.Must say very innovative.

Kartikeya Tiwari,"Rated The entry to the place was exactly how the name suggests, TAMASHA. The real life size truck (read bar) in the open area will put the transformer series to shame, and on the downside this makes you expect more. Not an easy situation to be in when the bar gets raised so high on the very entry point of the place. Hence starts the review, we were in some sort of a healthy eating mind frame so we ordered Calamari Chaat, Prawn Shumai and Harissa fish cakes, offcourse with few beers (forget health now). The food was served on time and looked delicious and beautiful on the plate, and yes it was delicious otherwise as well. The servers were very attentive which made all of us have atleast a beer more then planned, I like such places as there are places where you go with a mind frame that I will have 4 beers but you come back home after 3 itself, here we all exceeded the number which proves that the mix of ambiance, food and service was top notch. The dent on the pocket was also not much after such an evening. My opinion, wow, its a fantastic place, one of its own kinds, with everything going for it. I will come back here again and again, infact I am going there tonight also. Its a must try place, I guess it soon will feature in top 3 places of Delhi.",Rated 5.0,52,222,??

Bhawna Pathak,"Rated Tamasha is located in KG Marg. It's one of Delhi's biggest outlets on the ground floor. If you are looking for a great place to party, with good food and relaxed atmosphere, then head to TA MA SHA. This place promises lovely ambience and excellent food. This place have spacious outdoor sitting and courtyard, cozy rooftop, from where one can see The Stateman's House and a Truck Bar, a truck installation to serve drinks straight from their itself. The outlet looks innovative, contemporary, it has rustic interors, chic as well as modern and woody tones. Sheesha bar looks pretty amazing. Their sheesha are awesome.Sitting is casul but has few plush elements as well. This place is perfect for brunch, lunch or dinner date. One can simply chill out with friends because its an outrageous, grand in itself and fun experience out there. Their multi-cuisine menu conprises offerings from Continental, Indian, Mexian and Italian cuisines. The place also focuses on their presentation as its the only key to being different. The food is cooked in modern bistro style. Service is okayish too. As I visited on weekend, it was already jam packed, may be that's why service was little slow at that point of time. So I really can't give my verdict on service matter. I tried both cocktails as well as mocktails from the Truck Bar. Most of the drinks tastes wonderful. Now let's talk about the food. Honestly, New Way Caprese and Beetroot Roulade tastes pathetic. Veg Momos were little uncooked. Mushrooms vol-e-vents tastes delish. Dahi kebabs ravioli with mint dip was wonderful too. Both veg and non veg tikka tasters were nicely cooked. Amritsari Beer Batter Fish tastes heavenly. It was a perfect dish. Nachos with salsa were delicious. Chilly Chicken, Mutton Seekh Kebab were hit. Chittinad with Malabar Parontha was bang on. Totally yummza. Cheesy Russians were pretty good. Overall the food is pretty nice and innovative.

Maninder,"Rated the restaurant is done up nicely and has lots of open space to sit n relax but somehow the place is completely miss managed when it comes to staff training, etiquettes and service..i really hope that the management takes a note of issues faced by us and does justice to a place which has a lot of potential to be amongst the best. firstly, the server had no clue what drinks were available and made 3 trips to the bar counter/senior staff to check the availability. it took good 10-12 minutes to order basic drinks coz of ill informed staff. the basic drink(vodka) arrived after 10 minutes without an ice bucket and a juice decanter..we had ordered 2 drinks but got one so had to reorder the second drink. the glassware for serving the juice along with the drink was just not right and was impractical. server EXPECTEDLYspilled the juice onto the table while pouring into the main glass and UNBELIEVABLYdid not return to clean the table. we had to clean the table with the paper napkins kept on the table. all these things wasted more time and also spoiled our mood and appetite. the server who had taken my order simply disappeared and never returned. i got fascinated by the dish mentioned as paav bhaji fondue which is nothing but very basic paav bhaji. i don't know why its even a part of this kinda fancy looking restaurant. it took them 40 minutes to serve this paav bhaaji as the server had not placed our order of two starters to the kitchen team. it was only after i complained to the manager they took a note of it and we were finaly served.... the manager to whom i had complained about the delay never returned either to clarify or to apologise but sent a junior staff to say that there was a misscommunication on their part. other server who came to clear the plates after we were done with the first starter never returned with the fresh plates and we had to call for the plates for our second starter which had already arrived onto the table. the second starter was shanghai tofu which was soft and could have tasted better but was served COLD and therefore i was left with no other option but to leave for another restaurant at around 10:15 pm :( :( i wish to have a better experience in future.",Rated 2.0,2,1,??

Roaring over 1500 +sq ft of area, this bar flaunts an admirable open sitting space, large area, good decors and aesthetically innovative theme on bar (Giant Truck Look) and Sheesha counter. The location of the place is its plus point, right at the start of KG Marg in CP which is a big relief from CPs regular traffic jams. To add to your delight, you have hassle free valet parking facility as well. Excellent menu rich with variety of food and drinks. Among key non-veg delicacies they have Chicken Tikka, Chicken Goyzos, Tandori Chicken, Chicken Chettinand, Prawn Salad, Chicken Dimsums and Afghani Chicken Crostini and what not. The rich bar menu offers all sorts of cocktails, drinks and spirits; the key being Sangria, Bloody Mary, Tamasha Smash, Rum Punch, Desi LiiT and Cosmopolitan. Although on the day of launch, there was some initial trouble due to failure of kitchen equipment/oven. However, the management and the organisers took charge of the situation, geared up and things started happening. It was an overall good experience.

Deepika Bali,"Rated And I got to know the reason for the many people in New Delhi going gaga over the newly launched place at Kasturba Gandhi Marg in Connaught Place : TA MA SHA. This amazing place is on almost everyone's mind specially the foodies like me. So finally got a chance to visit TA MA SHA to attend our Bloggers Meet on 13th feb. Thank you so much Suchana Bera & Veta Ratra for inviting me to this fantastic newly launched place. The whole decor and interior is very classy and the ambience is very sober and amazing. It's a combination of luxury infused with a raw touch. Having a big open area at the front side along with a decent open area at the backside makes this place unique in itself. And the best part was their specific Sheesha Counter & A Big Giant Optimus Premium Bar ( A Big Truck ). Here comes the drinks part. I had a Virgin Mojito : Pretty good in taste , the sweetness and the tangyness is well balanced. Overall a great mocktail to have. Another mocktail which I had ordered was a fusion of orange juice and cranberry syrup with some mint leaves. This one was amazing. In the starters I had CHICKEN GOYZOS : Those were so awesome in taste that I cannot explain it in words. Those were the Roasted Chicken Dumplings served on a soup spoon with having garlic air sauce. Chicken was perfectly done and the quantity was also pretty decent. METHI MALAI TANGRI : Amazing in taste. Roasted beautifully and the texture was soothing. Spices were well balanced. CHICKEN TIKKA : This one was really one of the best non - veg starters I had. Lip - Smacking was the taste & the chicken was actually melting in the mouth. CHICKEN CHETTINAD WITH MALABARI PAROTTA ( PARATHA ) : One of the best combinations I love to eat. Typical Kerala style chettinad chicken with the taste which was bang on for me. CHILLI CHICKEN : Perfectly cooked chicken awesomely done in sauces & spices. Wasabi Pistschio Lamb : Mutton Seekhs served in pieces with some slices of pita bread were really smooth in taste and spices. Amazing dish to try!! In the main course I had Dal Makhni & Butter Chicken with Ginger Garlic Naan & Mint Naan. Both were really great in taste but I felt that the sweetness of the butter chicken is more on the higher side. Rest everything was amazing. Deserts : We were served a platter of a Red Velvet Cake , Chocolate Mousse & Tiramisu. I am a big fan of the Red - Velvet so I love my Red Velvet cakes a bit more creamy with fresh velvet chunks. And that was exactly the same. Awesome in taste , less sweetened. Tiramisu and mousse were also delicious.

Decently and simply done up in the heart of Delhi, huge covered area , Indoors, Terrace, front and back open area. Ample space to move around with around three hundred and plus covers. Another plus point, easy to locate or to reach there with valet parking available. It was mesmerizing sitting outdoor in sunny afternoon in front of the Bar which is made like a Truck. Had very colourful and refreshing Vodka based cocktails with fresh Green Apple, Peach, Lemon, Watermelon. Quite soothing, I must say. SPICY CHICKEN DIMSUMS.the stuffing was okay but the covering was a bit thick. SPICY PISTACHIO LAMB..spicy Seekh served with soft Pita and the perfect Hummus. BAIDA ROTI WITH ACHARI MUTTON.minced mutton stuffed roti served with mutton sauce. CHICKEN GYOZAS.steamed dumplings served with spicy roasted peanut dip. ARANCINIDal khichdi arancines were good to taste with crisp covering. NEW WAY CAPRESE.here baby bocooncini with tomato puree reduction were topped with honey balsamic caviar. BRAISED BUTTER CHICKEN .chicken was well done , curry was a bit sweet. MUTTON ROGAN JOSH.just perfect. Teething problems are there as it is launched just a few days back which is quite normal, but it is going to be smooth sailing in another couple of days as I could see a very big team is there to cater to the guests. All the best to Priyank, Jaideep and their team !",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Vinayak Bali,"Rated This Newest Entrant In The Main Hub Of New Delhi , Connaught Place , Has Left Many In Talking & Praising About This Place. Welcome To TA MA SHA , Another Rockstar Model By None Other Than Mr. Priyank Sukhija. Located In Beginning Of Kasturba Gandhi Marg. One Can Easily Spot The Board Very Easily. TA MA SHA Has Been Standing On 16000 Sq. Ft. , That Is A Whole Lot Of The Area. But I Must Say That It Has Been Designed Beautifully. The Ambience Is Superly Awesome. I Really Loved The Open Area In The Backside. One Can Actually Feel The Luxury Dining Infused With Modernised Tamasha. Finally I Got A Chance To Visit This Rockstar Model TA MA SHA On 13th Feb. I Really Loved The Optimus Prime Bar ( A Giant Truck ) & Specially The Sheesha Counter. Interesting!! Let's Talk About The Food & Drinks Part : To Start With I Only Had Three Drinks. 1st One Was The Tamasha Special. An Amazing In Taste Cocktail Made With Orange Juice , Pineapple Juice & Cranberry Syrup With Having Vodka As The Base. A Must Try!! 2nd One Was Even More Amazing. It Was A Chocolate + Espresso + Vodka. I Am In Love With This Cocktail. A Must Have!! 3rd One Was The Red Wine Sangria. A Glass Of Red Wine With Having Chopped Fruits. Loved It. Coming Onto The Food Part , I Had Some Of The Lip - Smacking Dishes. To Start With I Had Chicken Goyzos : They Were Literally Lip - Smacking. I Have Not Tasted Something Like That. Roasted Chicken Dumplings Served On A Soup Spoon & Topped With Garlic Air Sauce. The Quantity Of The Chicken Was Perfect. Chicken Chettinad With Malabari Parotta : I Only Wanted To Try A Bit Of This Kerala Style Dish , But As I Had My First Bite , I Had To Take Almost 4 Or 5 Bites. It Was So Flavourful I Cannot Explain In Words. The Malabari Parotta ( Paratha ) Was Complimenting This Dish Perfectly. Methi Malai Tangri : The Roasted Chicken Tangri It Was. Great In Taste. But I Found The Salt On A Higher Side. Otherwise One Can Enjoy The Tangri With Drinks. Chicken Tikka : One Of The Best Chicken Snacks I Really Love To Taste & I Am Very Peculiar About My Liking Of Taste Which I Want In Other Variants As Well. So This Chicken Tikka Was Just Bang On!! The Chicken Was So Awesomely Chargrilled That You Just Need To Open Your Mouth And You Will Feel The Chicken Melting In Your Mouth. Amritsari Beer Batter Fish : I Had Really High Expectations From This Dish. But Lemme Tell You This Was The Best Amritsari Fish I Had In Recent Times. Cooked To Perfection. The Fish Was A Melt In Mouth & So Soft. However I Did Not Really Feel The Taste Of The Beer. Amazing Dish To Try. Chilli Chicken : Awesome In Taste. Chicken Awesomely Cooked. Spices , Sauces & Seasonings Were Spot On For Me. Wasabi Pistachio Lamb : These Were The Mutton Seekhs Served In Pieces With Slices Of Pita Bread. They Were Really Awesome In Taste. Cooked To Perfection I Would Say. I Started My Main Course With Butter Chicken With Naan. I Found The Butter Chicken More On The Sweeter Side. The Dish Was Fine For Me. It Missed The Butter Chicken's Tangyness Or Sourness With A Little Bit More Of Spices. Then I Hog Onto Dal Makhni. Favourite For All The Punjabis. I loved The Dal Makhni. It Has All The Elements Which Is Required To Make A Proper Creamy & Medium Thick Dal Makhni. Topped With Lots Of Cream & Butter. Loved It To The Core!! However , I Did Not Like The White Sauce Pasta. It Was A Regular One For Me Topped With Grated Cheese. In Breads Part : I Really Loved The Ginger Garlic Naan & Mint Naan. Their Textures Are Worth A Look :) Tasted Awesome!! In Deserts : Deserts Are The Most Important Part Of The Whole Meal. We Were Served A Platter Of Red Velvet Cake , Tiramisu & Chocolate Mousse. I Really Loved It & The Main Reason For Loving Is Those Were Less Sweeten Which I Really Like. The Texture Of The Red Velvet Was Divine!! I Had One Of The Best Chocolate Mousse In Recent Times. Well Balanced Quantity Of Chocolate Was Just Spot On!! Overall A Must Have!! So , This Places Is A Must Visit. Everything Here Has An Element Of TA MA SHA In It. However , There Was Some Service Glitches But I Can Understand How Difficult It Would Be. And I Know This Will Be Sorted Out By Next Week. I Will Surely Be Coming Back Soooon To See More Of TA MA SHA..!! Best Wishes :)",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Vaibhav,"Rated Tamasha.!! We chose V-day brunch to visit this newly opened 'everyday' BAR by Priyank Sukhija, Who is a well known name in Delhi's FnB industry and this place certainly is good . I will rate it 5 on 5 for the ambience . Perfect sunny morning for a beautiful setting. Wonderful live music perfect to suit the taste and environ of V-Day. We took the V-Day brunch which included the salad bar , and a variety of preparations. And must say I haven't seen the huge menu for buffet snacks for long . ( similar to that of Kebab factory/barbecue nation ). The preparations are wonderful and well presented and of course a very good variety. The only part they need improvement in buffet was choice of dessert which was very limited. Also the service was little slow though this may be a part of teething problem for any new place . Overall I will rate it 4on 5 It has wonderful outdoor as well as indoor seating Must Try",Rated 4.0,23,13,??
Anuj Kumar,Rated A newly launched mess... We decided to go to Tamasha for Valentine's day however an awful service combined with the fact that they didn't have most of the items listed on menu made the entire evening a tamasha for us. Waiting time for drinks/ starters was over 40-60 minutes and almost everyone seated around us (on terrace area) was quite frustrated. Not sure if the positive reviews are just a PR push. Not recommended.,Rated 1.0,5,1,??

Dennis Nagpal,"Rated A lot of hype in just 2 weeks of opening. Beautiful place, outdoor and indoor. Menu not too costly like flying saucer. From ambiance to music everything is perfect but the food needs to taste better and quantity should be a little more. It's a new place so the staff is not very organized, they served me a wrong dish but changed on request. I'm sure that would be sorted out soon :) otherwise a very good place to spend evenings.",Rated 3.5,2,220,??
Bishmeet Gujral,"Rated One of the biggest launches of 2016Tamasha bar at CP!! Coming from Priyanks Group the place is already talk of the town. Recently visited to unfold what the Tamasha is all about and I can certainly say that the interiors are unique and the place is huge (first floor and rooftop). Things I liked: Bar in the form of a truck- unique concept! I went here with few friends and was disappointed seeing that the food service was so slow and it was a chaos. Initially they gave us the reason that there is some electricity issue and later when it got resolved the food was served in bits and bytes. We requested for two three dishes to be served again and still they did not serve it. I totally didnt like New way caprese, some tomato with filling inside and beetroot roulade..Just not my thing. Also, the veg momos were undercooked. The food that was good includes Chicken Chettinand with Malabar paranthas, Amritsari beer batter fish, tikka tasters, chili chicken, paneer tikka and Mocktails. The presentation is amazing which makes the food more tempting. Need to improvise on service.",Rated 3.5,83,348,??
Gaurav Mahajan,Rated last night waited for 30-40 mins before we were served with couple of cocktails however alcohol was missing from them. after 1 hr of wait we had to leave and story was the same on other tables. 70% of items in the menu were not available. even after compalining to the manager 2-3 times nothing happened. I would suggest to avoid this place for the time being before the management comes to their senses and start managing it better.,Rated 1.0,3,9,??

Vibhav Dwivedi,"Rated +MUST HAVE's+ Chicken Gyozas Chicken Chettinad - don't miss it.. +Intro & Location+ TAMASHA is the new entry in the heart of Delhi - Connaught place and the most loved and favourite place of Priyank Sukhija (from the ones he own). This time he has kept it away from the very busy and crowdy inner and outer circle. Situated on the entrance of K.G. Marg just next to Emmar building, can be found very easily.. +Service+ As it was a bloggers day event and busy Saturday the place was almost jam packed. The waiters were finding it difficult to serve the food on time. And as soon as the lunch time was over and most of the people had left, I found the real time service to be very good. I appreciate the food manager who took care of each and every order from all the tables and provided them in proper time. +Ambiance+ Oooooo la la.. No reason to hate this place. As soon as you enter this place, you will see the statesman house building in the back. And the place.. It is huge.. 3 different place to sit. With a big lawn in the front an a giant truck - 'Optimus Prime Bar' that serves as the bar along with an open sheesha counter that serves some amazing hookah Then the internal part..the interiors are done to perfection, it the very trendy wooden theme with yellow lights. The better part was the tables they are the highly decorated tables with various small small posters. Then the backyard. Again an amazing one with 2-3 trees left as it is and classic blue soft and couchy sofa.. Just so waowww.. +Food+ How come a place that has an amazing sitting lack in food. Some of the dishes that I liked: STARTERS (#)Trio of Chicken Tangri: as the name says it was a set of three leg pieces. And all had a different one. The one being the tandoori leg piece, second one being the malai one and third one a achari one. I liked this one all the pieces were cooked properly. Specially the tandoori one (#)CHICKEN GYOZAS: Well amazing it was. Just so amazing. Served roasted dumplings(momos - Indian name) on the soup spoon and dressed with garlic sause. It was amazing. The filling of chicken was in handsome quantity. (#)CHICKEN CHETTINAD: aahhh.. Hardly anyone would have hated it.. Cooked and served in a proper Kerala style. And served with malabar pratha. The chicken was just amazing cooked to ultimate perfection. The pratha was also very soft. (#)Mutton Seekh: the mutton seekh was good. Equally partitioned pieces. The better part was they were smooth and soft to eat. (#)Paneer Tikka: no big fan of paneer tikka if chicken is around. But yeh the the paneer looked good and cooked properly. (#)Chicken Tikka: well this is my liking. The boneless small pieces chicken. And it was good to have them here as well. Just open your mouth to have soft chicken pieces. Cooked to perfection; they looked too good. MAIN COURSE (#)BIRYANI: the biryani cooked very well I had the chicken biryani. The pieces were medium sized and spices were in proper content. (#)DAL MAKHNI: I liked the dal makhni a lot. A proper creamy dal makhni. Dressed with proper cream and butter. (#)BUTTER CHICKEN: well I did not like the butter chicken at all. It was more on a sweeter side rather than on the tanggyness. (#)PINK SAUSE PASTA: the mix of white and red sause paste. I like this one when in comparison to white sause one. (#)WHITE SAUSE PASTA: though I am a big liver of white sause pasta. But this was not cooked good at all. May be they forgot to add the spices over it. Also the white cream.lacked in the bowl. The pasta pieces were also not properly boiled. (#)ASSORTED BREADS: ginger garlic naan was what I had and liked it a lot. DRINKS (#)VIRGIN MOJITO: well like the way it is everywhere. Served in a stylish beaker shaped glass and dressed beautifully with onion and mint leaves. (#)MOJITO: well the content of vodka was equal to the other ingredients of the drink. Not much strong not light. (#)SANGRIA: a glass of red wine with some fresh fruits. Liked it. (#)an unknown drink offered by a friend. I don't know the name but its composition had coffee and vodka.. And I loved this one.. DESERTS We were served with a custom made desert platter beautifully decorated. It had: (#)RED VELVET CAKE: though I am big lover of red velvet cake but it was not much surprising.for some the bread base was hard, but likeable. (#)CHOCOLATE MOUSSE: Well a big lover of chocolate dishes. And live this one the content of chocolate in the middle.of amazing. Truly loved it.. MUST HAVE (#)TIRAMISU: I am a big coffee lover. Though many people don't like it, but if you are a coffee lover, do go for it. +Final Verdict+ In the heart of the city we have a huge place that has so many things to offer. Not only it will surprise you with the beauty of the place, the food is good also. Though most of the food meets the standard of proper Punjabi shop but there are many dishes that can surprise you. I would recommend to order something that looks and sounds interesting rather ordering the regular food that we order from nearby shop..

As i reached the place was almost dead and there was no food as they have some electircity problem with their kitchen and they said thay it will fix within an hour. We waited for almost 3 hours and we didnt get any food. They have large place with many tables but we felt like they were tottaly not interested in serving as i ordered sheesha which i thought must be speciality over here but it was worst. Starting sheesha with 850 bucks i got broken sheesha with broken pipe and then i ordered for change which i gor after 15 mins which also not made properly. People serving was least interested in making anything right. Too much disappointed as head lot about the place. I asked for cheque and they didnt even have machine.

I went there last night with a few friends and had the most amazing time. As soon as u enter the place it's hard to believe that ur in cannaught place. This place has a lovely outdoor area with a Truck bar (not to be missed). As there were no tables available we went to the lovely terrace.unfortunately being a Saturday night the whole place was booked prior maybe. We had to adjust with a small standing table next to the bar. So make sure u book in advance if u wish to visit this place. The food again was extraordinarily good. We ordered baida Roti, chicken chettinad and some pan fried dimsums ( don't remember the exact name of this dish on the menu). I would definitely come back to this place soon to try more food.

Garag Keshaav,"Rated Tamasha as the name suggest the place is a total package . One of the best outdoors that i have been to is this place . Once you reach there you can see tamasha written in flying colors. Ambience : You can feel the place , the ambience is rocking . The place has a separate sheesha bar and the sheesha they served was crazy as hell . The most loving part is their bar in that transformer truck . Hahhhah Food: Talking about food , it was a hassle because the place was flushed with crowd so the service eventually got slow . But then they conquered it all . You can see they have done some new experiments with the food . My recommendations Paneer tikka - Nicely done Cheese nachos - Yumm Dahi ke kebab - Soft as candy floss Daal makhni & pudina parantha Veg biryani - Next level * Did not like their beetroot roulade and new way caprese or maybe because i have a 'Desi Tongue ' . Drinks : Aaahh the place has a lot to offer to quench your thirst . Started my ride with virgin mojito as always and found it good . For mocktails i could only see the regular names . But they had amazing cocktails like tamasha special , both red n white sangaria . Ohh not to forget the chocolate +coffee+vodka , turned out to be a hell of a drink . Even liked their cold coffee , can't get over it . As far the place is good , not everything can be perfect . Yesterday wasn't a good day for team tamasha but i hope they will see through it .

Gurneet Kaur,"Rated I was invited for the launch party yesterday along with my foodie friends. The fact that there are so many resturants to choose from in CP puts a lotof pressure on the resturants to make their food do the talking. This resturant has been the talk of the town lately. Did it live up to its expectations? Yes. Did I enjoy the food? Oh yes! So Tamasha is right next to Parikrama so it is easier to reach here without getting stuck in the CP traffic. There is a huge open seating area which is perfect for a weather like this. You see a separate shessha counter right on the entry. Honestly this is the first time a resturant has taken shesha so seriously. There is an indoor seating area which is where the bar is. So finding a table here shouldn't be very challenging beccause of the ample space. It is such a refreshing change to go to a resturant wherein one can actually breathe. I started my meal here with Red Wine Sangrias which was just what I needed after a crazy afternoon! I ate the following: BRAISED BUTTER CHICKEN: I loved the fact that the butter chicken wasn't too creamy or overly sweet. It had the right texture with generous pieces of chicken. The garlic nann went perfectly with the gravy. BAKED BUTTER CHICKEN PENNE: I love it when resturants try something new and the outcome is as good as this pasta. Just the right amount of spices, this was cooked well. DAL MAKHANI: I enjoyed this more than the butter chicken meal. Our all-time favorite served right! I loved the presentation and also the fact that it was kept simple without too muuch experimentation with the flavors. The STAR DISH for the meal for me was the CHICKEN BIRYANI. Having studied in Jamia for two years, I have had some really good biryanis but could never enjoy a good biryani at a resturant. Boy you have to try this one! I can still imagine the taste while writing this! Basmati rice cooked along with some delicious herbs, spicy yet notoverpowering the dish. Full marks for this. I ended my meal with Tiramisu which honestly left me wanting for more. But being thelaunch, I can exscuse the team getting one dish wrong. An extra half mark for the staff who inspite of the place being so packed took so much care and ensured we were served food on time. The server, Anant, needs a special mention who afetr finding out that it is my friend's birthday brought the best drinks for him. I honestly had an amazing time and can't wait to go back and try the more fro m the menu!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Now, coming on to the food I had here. We had few mocktails, Sangria, Hummus Martini, Japanese Bento Box, Deconstructed Tiramisu and Pav Bhaji Fondue there. Their Jack Daniels infused Dal Makhni is a must try. Loved the Pav Bhaji Fondue and Hummus Martini. Deconstructed Tiramisu was droolworthy.

They have an array of cocktails, mocktails and more to get you ready to party. The hookah is a huge hit with the young crowd. The food is also spot and decently priced. I loved the Dahi ke kebab ravioli it is super soft and tastes great. The nachos served with cream cheese are good for munching on as you drink. The main course is multi cuisine. The desi butter chicken, dal, mutton roganjosh is delectable. I tried the Thai red curry bento box, the rice and chicken Thai curry are my comfort food and I loved it. The kimchi is tangy and crunchy. The fish lovers on my table were happy with their Phuket fish. The chicken chettinad with malabari parantha was yummy and not over the top spicy.

Staff was very confused and was not at all prepared for a food meet. Guys learn the basics if you have an equipment malfunction in your kitchen then where is the backup???. At least have the courtesy to inform the guests. I was more surprised to see that food was flowing for normal visitors for not for the bloggers who were invited today. GROW up guys don't humiliate people who came driving from far.,Rated 1.0,18,19,??

Ajay Mago,"Rated I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours. The chef knows how to please the guests. This is a very unique place and the best terraces in town . Staff was very attentive, smiling and very welcoming. Highly recommended. Must place for a hangout with your friends over drinks, food and music. Don't forget to take a pic with the giant truck which is actually converted into a bar. Congratulations to the owners.",Rated 5.0,9,154,??
Namrata Gambhir,"Rated I had gone to CP with a bunch of friends on a bar hopping trail. We started with Odeon Social, then went to Farzi and kept Tamasha as the grand finale. I think this place absolutely completes the revival of CP as a chilling hub. The ambience is spectacular! The open air bar on the terrace is really contemporary and chic. I also really liked the truck as a decor accent. Also, I am glad that this place focused on the food and drink quality as well. We ordered jagermiesters (the molecular version), desi LIITs and mojitos. The molecular drinks deserve a special mention as they were quite unique. In food, we tried Spanish baby tangy potatoes, spicy margherita, and their Thai box. I felt that they could make the potatoes tangier, but apart from that the food was sumptuous. The service was good and the staff recommended stuff to try so that was helpful. The place isn't that expensive so the high doesn't wear-off once you look at the bill! :p",Rated 4.5,77,723,??
Faraz Signage,Rated So this was the most awaited restaurant in delhi by priyank sukhija and man .... This guy knows how to pull the job . We went there on Monday night and they were still awaiting liquor license but they said they would serve this weekend for which I'm going back already . The ambience is unparalleled and the place is huge. The location on kg marg is the best located restaurant in delhi.we had a shee sha which was amazing and had baida roti and pav bhaji fondue. I met the manager and he said that liquor prices are going to be same as Lord of the drinks which is also owned by the same group so it can't get better . This is by far the best place in town. Found my new home.,Rated 5.0,1,2,??
Rahul Oberoi,"Rated So we ended up going to CP once again but were confused regarding the cafe's because all the places were so ""been there done that""- a friend had heard about this place from one of her friends and we thought lets give it a try! We started off with cocktails like ""LIIT"" priced at INR 695 plus taxes for 1000 ml which is value for money and one can send you flying to space! Between the six of us we had 8 cocktails and did not go straight drinks at all, We ended up ordering The Tom Collins, Black Russian, and Manhattan! woooshhhh! Loved every bit of it. The place is very beautifully done has HUGE! Seatings! FINALLY a place i can visit several times without getting bored with 4 sections - rooftop - courtyard and a small patio! Ambience - 5/5 Service - 4/5 Food - 4/5 Cocktails - 6/5 ( ;) To die for ) Overall : 4.5 / 5",Rated 4.5,26,970,??
Manasi Taneja,"Rated This being one of the most awaited and happening places in the extremely mainstream area of KG marg was sadly a huge dissapointment! It was so badly mismanaged, servers dint know the menu, they coudnt take our order well! Coming to the food, we ordered everything almost on the menu hoping something that would fill our empty stomachs! Had to literally yell for the servers to take our drinks order( just kept telling us that they cant serve us alcohol which is fair , we were thirsty only for mojito's man!! ). Portions are so tiny amongst the starters and maincourse which consisted of chicken chettinad and mutton roganjosh which is like basic, instead tasted just like outta low grade wedding!! Only thing nice was ambience given the fact it was a lovely sunny day and we were a bunch of 10 Chika girls! Sorry I am not coming here again better places to go man! Ciao.",Rated 1.5,5,102,??
Ishrat Jahan,"Rated Brand new place and second day of serving guests. Went to check it out with a colleague today for lunch. Place has a few kinks to work out. Ordered the Chinjabi which was great but too much for lunch - maybe great portion for others. Definitely generous portion sizes. Servers were friendly and accommodating. We sat outside by the fence and they were testing the mist cooler- felt like we were in the rain and water all over. They did turn it off upon request - avoid tall table by fence if the mist spray is on. Food took over 30 mins - close to 45 mins to arrive during lunch. Will forgive for now since they are new, working out kinks, and two large groups were being tended too. Very promising and look forward to visiting again to try out more of their menu.",Rated 3.5,7,14,??
Piyush Nahata,"Rated Before you start reading I've not given a 5 star rating to any restaurants I've reviewed except, This! When you think of Tamasha, you cant imagine the place hence we decided not to look and directly leave it to surprise and it was worth it This has to be the place Delhi was waiting for, 16000 sq ft! 3 layers of seating including one rooftop over looking the massive Indian Flag at CP! The Courtyard has to be one of the finest layers of the lot with more European comfortable seating having cushions at every table and hence we decided to anchor our-self over there! Our waiter guided us to the table and took care of our order! We started the evening of with The Kadhai Paneer Nachos, which were off the hook, Being from Bombay i had to try the Pav Bhaji Fondue and it was next level, it reminded me of Bombay with the first bite - I kid you not! We ended our starters run with Baked Mushrooms and it did not disappoint. Phew! We moved our-self to main-course the thing which caught my attention was ""ChinJabi"" Punjabi X Chinese - The taste and the flavors so properly blended, i wanted to order one more. The highlight of the evening was the Deconstructed Tiramisu! - The bitterness was just perfect to give you a hit and remind you of Italy! Everything from the Professional Service, Decor and Music was perfect! Our waiter took the time to suggest the drinks to go with it and the overall experience was just divine. Definitely need to comeback and explore more!",Rated 5.0,42,516,??
