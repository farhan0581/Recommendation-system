Sonia Chhillar,"Rated Going to Dunkin' Donuts is always a happy experience. Pleasant music and to add to charm is the dining area. A very filling variety of burgers, Naughty Lucy veg. is a must try. Wicked wraps are something unavoidable if you go there. Coffee tastes very nice, even the simplest Classic has its own taste and so are the milkshakes especially Fruit berry. Love it. Simply Awesome!",Rated 4.5,6,2,??

Kaustav Datta - Foodiepanda,"Rated Owned and operated by the Jubilant Foods group in India, Dunkin Donuts is one of the best global food chains to have come to India and establish their business. My experience at their Connaught Place outlet is a testimony to that excellence. ABSOLUTE LOVE!! That's what I feel for this place. I went there with a group of friends and tried out some of the best items I'd heard on their menu. Much to my delight, they were all amazing! AMBIANCE: The place is easy to locate and the decor is simply beautiful, comfy and warm. CCDs, I feel, are pass for dates these days. One needs to explore newer and better options for a simple lunch date or a place to hangout with friends and chill, and Dunkin Donuts is just the place you might want to be. They have the same kind of decor at most outlets: a blue wall with colourful face murals hanging, white brick walls with black boards and chalk drawings filling them up and probably, a soft corner area with some sofas and a lampshade. Perfectly comfortable and cozy. SERVICE: The place is a counter service outlet where you place your order and collect the same at the counter itself before you leave. The food is served quick and fast and the person handling the counter was agile and courteous. A polite staff is always a welcome sight at major food chain outlets. FOOD: We went in a group of 3 folks (all non-vegetarians) and one of us was giving a treat, so we spared no expense in trying what we really wanted to. We ordered - Double Mutton Burger - Spicy Grilled Chicken Burger - Jamaican Rum and Almonds - Mocha Chip - Virgin Mojito Coolatta - Death by Chocolate Donut - Nutty Strawberry Donut The BURGERS were good. I specially liked the Spicy Grilled Chicken Burger more than the Double Mutton Burger. The Chicken burger was really delicious; right amount of sauces and beautifully spiced patty with soft and fresh bread. Not much of a dressed up burger, but certainly tasty as such. The Mutton burger had a slight hint of mustard sauce and some onion rings stacked on a mutton patty. A little less meaty I guess, and also lacked some strength in taste. I've heard much about the Naughty Lucy burgers here and certainly intend to try them next time. Amongst the drinks, we really loved the Jamaican Rum and Almonds and the Mocha Chip very much. Certainly a delight to accompany any burger or croissant here. The Virgin Mojito Coolatta was good too! Strong and fresh minty in taste! I really loved them all. The DONUTS were perfect!! The Death by Chocolate is my personal favorite pick of the two. The chocolate layering was so warm and yummy! It kinda melts in your spoon itself even before it reaches your tongue. The smell and taste is so so enticing! I loved every bite of it with equal undivided love :P The Nutty Strawberry was tasty too. It was a ring type donut with a layering of strawberry cream and small chunks of nuts scattered over it. Certainly a good choice. I personally though want to try out more of their Chocolate donuts. Make sure to take an entire pack of all their different chocolate flavored donuts when you're there. You WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!! VALUE FOR MONEY: The place is certainly a good and viable choice for its donuts and accompanying drinks. For the food, the place might be a bit over-valuing the items. Overall, I'd say a decently priced place that provides some really good options compared to other chains.

Shagun Garg,Rated This one has a great variety of doughnuts available in different flavors. I just love the ugly Strawberry one and tried it twice. They introduce new fare after every few months. Their Naughty Lucy burger is a must try. It is filled up with a huge amount of cheese inside the patty. Everything here is high on calories so choose your option wisely!,Rated 4.0,20,80,??
Manavv Piplani (Bribing Stomach),"Rated A great place to visit if you have a sweet tooth but also if you are a burger lover, They have alot of variety in burgers & wraps and their drinks can't go unnoticed.

Aditi Malhotra,"Rated Given Enough Coffee You Could Shake The World!!! This is what Dunkin Donut claims as they launch some very interesting new coffees. Its not a very regular thing when innovation with coffee happens. We may visit different cafes, and they might name their coffees differently, but they all end up tasting the same, with hardly a difference to make out. To bridge this gap, Dunkin has really gone overboard in their research and come up with not one but four new coffees, and these coffees are of the kinds that we normally don't get in coffee shops. The first coffee is named Bangalore Start-Up Coffee. As the name suggests, its for the night owls busy working on ideas that will one day(hopefully) change the world. A 100% Arabica roast coffee beans decoction, in piping hot milk, inspired by South-Indian filter coffee and the start-up culture. But you really don't need to be in a start-up to drink this one. This coffee reminded me of the coffee I drink at home every morning, which is basically coffee added to a warm glass of milk. To get this kind of homely taste in a coffee shop, is something we never expect. We go to coffee shops for fancy coffees, but sometimes what you really need is that feeling of home comfort, home like taste and Bingo, this coffee gives you exactly that. The next coffee, is meant strictly for bold and daring people, because this guy is tough and its actually named Tough Guy Cappuccino. This coffee is like the real friend who has no sympathy for you, he is like the friend who tells you, your face is dirty and you look like an idiot, when other friends like your pic on the social media, this coffee makes you wake up and smell the coffee. The triple shot of dark roasted espresso with a tint of brandy is so tough that you can't escape the reality. Do not drink this one if you are clear-headed! I personally liked this coffee the most, though the comfortable Bangalore Start-Up Coffee reminded me of home like taste, this one truly became my best friend. The aroma of coffee, the tint of brandy, made it a more than perfect combination when in need to think clear. I am gonna go back a lot to Dunkin for this tough guy, because you don't find guys like this easily these days ;) I even clicked a selfie with this one :) What do you do, when somedays you felt like being held, you hold a cup of fuzzy mix of chocolate and coffee, with whipped cream for some extra love and cinnamon for the feeling to linger. This is the coffee you hold when you need to be held. Its your partner in therapy, its called the Therapeutic Cappuccino. And just as the name says, it is that therapy you need when sometimes you are too low or even too happy, its a coffee, you at back and relax with. Its a coffee that makes you forget things happening around you, its a coffee, that even after its finished, makes it difficult to part with. So its really not a coffee, its a therapy, its a coffee spa, its a massage, that you want to go on and on with. The chocolate and coffee mix, the sweetness of whipped cream and that dash of cinnamon, all put together make it more than a perfect combination of tastes. And last but not the least, came the coffee which had no story, it was too direct and straightforward. Simply a no nonsense stuff, a straight up black coffee, minus the bitterness. This is one thing that we all drink black coffee for, for it being straight, strong and directly hard hitting, and at the same time, we still dislike the too much of bitterness it comes with. I am personally very fond of black coffee, but yes honestly speaking, the bitter taste it leaves me with, is not quite liked. Duncan has really found a solution to it, and come up with a coffee, which is black, but doesn't taste bitter. And to substantiate the difference, we were served a Dunkin Black along with a regular Americano Black Coffee. The difference was very very evident and Dunkin gives me another reason to go back to them. In fact Dunkin has really given me 4 new reasons to go back to them again and again and I definitely will. I am very sure that these four new coffees will give coffee lovers a lot of reason to visit Dunkin Donuts soon and I recommend tasting all of them, so at least 4 visits for that and then keep going back for one or the other :) facebook.com",Rated 4.0,10,66,??
Mansi,"Rated Love this place specially after the renovation...their service is amazing even if its crowded...and the burgers are neatly packed always...love their donuts alive by chocolate, death by chocolate, ugly strawberry, breakup party clair and the best part they are always tasty....",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Reetika Ralhan,Rated A nice place to hangout with friends. The burgers and donuts are amazing but the beverages are not upto the mark. I'm a regular here and I try new things. My latest find was Crunchy Joe. It was a nice burger and does justice to it's name as it was very crunchy.,Rated 3.5,25,27,??
Diya Negi,"Rated I ordered 3 Non-Veg and 1 veg burger. I received all 4 non-veg burgers. Just when the vegetarian lady was about to take a bite one of us thankfully noticed the mistake, I immediately called up Dunkin and they said they will send a veg one. First we wait for half an hour for the order to arrive (which is understandable) then again we wait for another 45 minutes for the other ""correct"" one to come. After allll the wait a very smiling delivery boy who does not even apologise in the first place asks us to give them back the previous wrongly delivered non veg burger and then in return he will take out the veg one from his bag. Not that I had any issue in paying for this one or returning the previous one but it was just surprising to see such a customer service. Found it a little cheap and not expected it from Dunkin. I did spare a few minutes to call up the manager and confirm wether he actually asked him to do so and to my surprise he did. Really shocking to see such a service. I would rate this Dunkin a 1. Food is amazing but service is poor.",Rated 1.0,1,0,??
Lokesh Dagar,Rated No doubt dunkin donuts is the best place to have yummy donuts .hot chocolate Is also yumm. Too much burger is not that good but donuts :* Love for donuts,Rated 4.0,6,0,??

Krishna Narayan,"Rated Visited for an evening coffee got a nightmare instead, the woman left to Shakti K, just didn't want to take my order and murmured something to herself, the guy left to her was staring at me blankly, when I asked whether placing an order is so complicated the woman became very vehement and vociferous, then Shakti K offered to take the order, but still it is not over,the short girl at the delivery won't touch the receipt and from a distance squinted saying coffee and without telling me kept a coffee at the side, then very badly told ,yeh coffee AAP hi ka hai, le lijiye, as a cleverly hidden smart insult. In what unnecessary matters people acquire smartness one wonders, why can't they simply serve and leave us alone instead of becoming extreme smart devils with satanic misbehaviour just to insult and disturb the evening of an unsuspecting visitor not suspecting that such networked conspiracy is lurking to get the better of your evening mood in addition to taking your money",Rated 1.0,4,0,??
Surabhi Seth,Rated Great location. Ample amount of tables. Always soo full. All time favorite burgers are Naughty Lucy and Tough Guy burger. Check out their schemes for donuts cause they keep having great offers on them.,Rated 3.5,51,122,??
Simon Rodrigues,"Rated This Donut shop , located in the N Block of Connaught Place bustling with people carrying big dozen boxes of donuts is way better than the outlet at GIP, Nehru place and other CP outlet. It now have lot of options in the burger section and is a perfect place who crave for spicy stuff!! The wicked wrap would make your mouth go watery.. no mater how much stuffed you are..

Shruti Bisht,Rated So I am a hard core non vegetarian and the biggest turn off for me was- DECEPTIVELY SMALL POTIONS OF BURGERS. I have tried the spicy chicken grilled..which was neither spicy enough nor very tasty. The sweet corn burger was still better. And the saving grace had to the POTATO WEDGES.,Rated 3.0,33,66,??
Deepika Bhagwani,"Rated Dunkin has always been a nice place to chill! This dunkin donut outlet is located very near to the rajiv chowk metro station, and is spacious and well constructed. Interiors are nicely done. Been here a couple of times, service and staff both are pretty good. I used to be a dunkin fan! But lately their quality has deteriorated. Donut range is limited, and the burgers not upto the mark. Gear up Dunkin!",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

We had #Chocolate Milkshake - Awesome taste! Shake was creamy, sweet, and soo chocolaty...every sip was worth it. #Classic glazed donut - Mine favourite... Simple & Best! #Double crunch sweetcorn- This is the new addition in the menu. It had crunchy patty of sweetcorn along with fried babycorns in it. It is messy but awesome taste of the burger will make u forget about surroundings. Loved it!

Akanksha Gupta,Rated The favorite dunkin outlet due to the cool look this place posses with decorative walls and lights! Simply attractive. Located in the heart of Delhi this place is a decent good one. Famous for their donuts obvious. Although I like most of their donut categories but yes their 'Death by chocolate' needs a special mention here. For all the chocolate lovers out there it is a perfect thing to grab on a chillin winter evening! Ahh! Lovely it was. Coming to other things on menu.

Namrata Shankar,"Rated One of the favourite budget food hangouts at CP. And apart from Donuts, wide variety of Burgers, Sandwiches and Wraps to choose from. I always go for a coffee or Dunkachino here. Pretty good. I wish they would come out with more variety of donuts though, apart from the regular chocolate ones. The highly recommended burgers here would be The Naughty Lucy(N. Veg) and The Heaven Can Wait Burger. Not disappointed at all.",Rated 3.5,28,107,??
Aarushi Mittal,"Rated The donuts are to die for. The place has a great ambience. The coffee is inconsistent, sometimes great and other times it is okay. Some of the Burgers are really delicious. I love to go to DD whenever I am near by. No one can be better at donuts than DD!",Rated 5.0,5,6,??
Aditya Singh- The Wanderlust Foodies,"Rated I have been to this place only once and it was a good visit. The setup is nice and comfortable first of all. The staff is cooperative and friendly which made my visit even better. I had the Naughty Lucy Chicken burger and Butterscotch Dunkaccino. The burger in itself is pretty heavy and enough for one person with the Dunkaccino. The burger was amazing. It was neatly presented and wasn't falling apart and it was absolutely delicious. The chicken was cooked to perfection. The sauce was exquisite and did wonders to the burger with the lettuce and onions. This burger could not have been better. The Dunkaccino was great too. The smooth shake with amazing butterscotch taste. I would visit this place for this Dunkaccino alone. It was great. I also had the Cinnamon and the blueberry doughnuts. Both of them were soft and good. I liked the blueberry one better because it had more taste than the cinnamon one. Overall, a great place for burgers and shakes. Doughnuts are good as well.",Rated 4.0,45,243,??
Sangharsh Borse,Rated I am becoming fan of their burgers. They serve one of the best donuts in the town. Burgers are also giving though competition to other joints. Perfectly baked buns with tasty patty makes their burgers awesome. Chicken was perfectly cooked and tender. Next time It will not be surprising if I visit this place just to try their burgers.,Rated 4.0,50,301,??
Malika,"Rated I really didnt get the fact that why people praise Dunkin's burgers soo much. Tried Crunchy joe, Classic and Lucy Veg here, well everything was much below the average. The buns were too oily and too stiff to bite. Avoid the burgers range guys, they are not worth the shot. Not a good experience!",Rated 2.0,19,58,??
Havyas,Rated One would be surprised to hear that the burgers of Dunkin Donuts is something which is as fine and sumptuous as their famous Donuts. The donuts however are legendary especially Death by Chocolate or Alive by Chocolate or Cinnamon Rolls. You can live n die again and again for them. Nothing like a warm Donut on a chilly evening.,Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Sagar,"Rated This was my second experience with Dunkin. And not a good one. Again. We ordered one wicked Paneer wrap, one cold coffee and one iced tea. We didn't even finish one thing. Not even half. Wrap was not warm. It was dry from inside. Very little sauce. Just fried or grilled chunks of Paneer. Cold coffee was too sweet. Iced tea had almost no flavour. Couldn't finish it. Probably they should sell their donuts only.",Rated 1.0,48,50,??
Vaibhav Jain,"Rated Taking my 2 ratings back. The staff at the order counter being ridiculously rude. I having no idea about what burger can be best to eat. As i always had donuts and dunkachino and coffee here. What i get as an answer with a rude tone is , i don't eat veg. So I can't tell you and started laughing. Should i make a complaint of this like do you see a counter guy telling his personal choice to a guest. To his ""non-sensible humour"" (offcourse for himself) told him - you can atleast suggest you work here and then he suggests me what i can have. I mean what the hell is this. Now, if i start writing something wrong here you people will make an issue of this as well. He was rude in so many other things. While i was clicking pictures for zomato. Was not asked to not click in a polite manner but told again in a very rude statement ""hey don't do that you can't take pictures of our interiors"" really? My friend told him why i am taking them and he says - giving the menu and saying ""iski lelo"". You are not allowed to take pictures of this. Seriously? Dunkin's I generally don't but if this repats i am complaining. Also, when we were given our order - no sauce no sugar nothing was served along. We had to ask again and again. What's wrong? Dunkin's was such a nice place in these things atleast. 3 is for the quality & taste of food you serve nothing else.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Arun Vasudevan,"Rated This is the third dunkin I review and for some reason the ambience wasn't up to the mark. I had visited this outlet on Dec 11, as I entered I noticed that the ground floor is pretty chaotic, so I eventually went upstairs just to find that it's worse over there. They have filled all the space with chairs making it tough to commute within the outlet itself! Especially when it's crowded. So not dunkin. Coming to the food about which I can hardly complain, the newly chicken burger is great and the ugly strawberry donut has stuck the right chords for me. :) Not to forget, the voodoo wrap is still the king.",Rated 3.5,30,55,??

Aanchal Mathur,"Rated The best place to eat and have a good time, chic ambience and a whole variety of menu to chose from. Apart from the new Interiors and seating arrangement, the menu has also been revised and for good, though they've reduced the sandwiches which were amazing but the new burgers are also a must try. The home delivery system can be a little improved as the call is unanswered a lot of times. Kindly check the phone number that you have mentioned here as I think it's not the right one. Nobody answers on that, instead the other one with a 6 in the end is answered.All in all it's a great place to have a great meal and relax !",Rated 4.0,3,69,??
Akshita Nanda,"Rated I think it'll be safe to say Dunkin' burgers are one of the best burgers in Delhi. Their CP outlet is one of the super amazing ones, colorful ambience and nice music. On my most recent visit here, I ordered a chicken Naughty Lucy Burger (isn't it just the best?), a Jamaican rum and almonds dunkaccino, a hot chocolate and well, a break up party clair. Words can't describe the cheesy heaven you are in while eating the Naughty Lucy. This perfectly prepared burger has a cheese center chicken patty, the cheese starts flowing after the first bite and goes on till the last. The Jamaican Rum n Almond dunkaccino is a strong coffee based drink, with a slight rum flavor and loads of crushed almonds. This is even better when taken with an extra shot of cream. Yum. Yum. Yum. Their chocolate is good, but I've had better. It's a refined version of chocolate milkshake. The breakup party clair, my personal favorite, was , as usual, amazing. Well heated and really nicely prepared. The caramel sauce on top lightens the flavors even more! Amazing food, and good preparations. Loved it!",Rated 4.5,45,302,??

Shweta Aggarwal,"Rated Dunkin Donuts comes in my mind when Ive desire of filling my stomach with donuts. A friends visit in CP ended with Dunkin. Its a well-lit two floored outlet. The interior is colorful with hanging lanterns everywhere. We got a corner table on the first floor. We ordered Crunchy Joe Veg Burger, and Voodoo Wrap Paneer with Coke Zero, and Large Iced Tea in drinks, and Hug Me! donut in dessert. Crunchy Joe Burger has crunchy buns with soft tikki inside, liked it but not something which I prefer to order myself. Voodoo Wrap Paneer was filled with veggies, but the mix of chutneys was sweet for my palate. Didnt enjoy the Large Iced Tea at all. Hug Me donut was the best of all, cinnamon based shell donut, sweet and subtle in flavors. I liked the place because of the chill ambiance and their donuts menu. thefoodiefling.blogspot.com",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Siddharth Verma,"Rated Staying till donuts Will be better. This outlet is cool and ambience is nice with decorative walls and hanging lights. Donuts are nice, obviously it will be. They are known for donuts. But hold on before you go beyond donuts. Tried burger and lemon tea, both didn't meet the expectations. This was the worst lemon tea ever had, more like nestea ice tea with extra water which ruined the whole taste. Burger only the packing was nice, it didn't look nice, forget taste. Big onion pieces and rough texture of the bun made it difficult to swallow.",Rated 2.5,36,188,??

Except chocolate one's, there is no doubt in trying the others. I love Classic White and Stuck on You. They all tastes awesome. For burgers, Potato Hash is yummiest!! The crunchy veggie was a big disappointment. I will also avoid the Iced Tea. But the shakes are cool and worth trying.

Heaven can wait came highly recommended and I decided to take my cousin's advise and go for it. And man it did not disappoint. I didn't really care for the ingredients and all I knew about the burger was that it was made of Mutton. The amazing blend of ingredients and the flavour was astonishing.

I have tried 2 veg ones ( chef's special and naughty lucy) and the bread had a very different and fresh taste. They were humongous and enough for 2 people alongwith a drink. Now the best part- VODOO wraps. The best wrap i have tasted yet. Crunchy fillings, sauces, veggies and enormous size.

Mohammad Hashir,"Rated Growing up on Dunkin Donuts' Long Johns and coffee, it's very strange to see Dunkin Donuts sell burgers. Having tried them, I don't understand why they have to be so Indian-ized. I had Naughty Lucy and Tough Guy and while I loved the cheese filling of Naughty Lucy I was highly put off by the masala flavour of the patty. Same for Tough Guy. Also there's no fries + drink combo. If dunkin can sell burgers then they can definitely sell fries as well; having a burger without fries seems blasphemous. As for the donuts, most of them taste good but I yearn for simple chocolate covered donuts. Not Death by Chocolate or Alive by Chocolate. Fast food chains should be same around the world, why is Dunkin India so different?",Rated 2.5,12,37,??

Agrima Bhutani,Rated It is the place to be when you have a major craving for cheesy burgers or donuts with a wide range of variety also available.

The donut had filling of blueberry puree in one part and on top it had strawberry sauce and chocolate. Along with donut i had the brute tough guy chicken and hot chocolate, they use bagel instead of normal burger bun in dunkin, burger is enough for your satity. They dont take extra chages for adding cheeze, they already put a slice in burger, the sauce in the burger is quite good, patty is tasty, there is ham alomg with patty, and they put bellpeppers and capsicum too into the burger.

With the head of the people in kitchen partially open I am not spruced that strands of hair made into the Naughty Lucy Veg Burger. I am sorry I do not have a pic. Was too agitated to do that.

Whenever I ve visited,the CP outlet is brimming with customers though there's never been any waiting time.The service is fast and efficient and smiling.This time was no different. I tried the Veg Wicked Wrap which fully justified its name ;it was hot n spicy n really delicious, very different from the paneer based mildly spiced Not So Wicked Wrap. The Wicked one had a lot of nachos which added a wonderful crunch to it.Had to wash it down with a chilled Cold Coffee,nicely made.Also had a Veg Cupwich with mushrooms and cheese.Sinful n delightful.Had a bite out of a friend's Veg Crispy Joe Burger but it was very oily and I didn't like it at all.Also tasted the Alive by Chocolate doughnut and it was good but then I can't rave about it.I ve already confessed to not being a doughnut lover. I love this outlet over the others because of its ambience....(see the pics) It has a fresh ,young feel to it and is a bright cheerful place. Would certainly recommend this outlet over the others.

Akshay Garg,"Rated Always liked their donuts before krispy kreme came to Delhi. Later i realised how mediocre these donuts are in comparison to krispy kreme. ALTHOUGH the best thing they served were the chocolate filled sugar coated dough balls called munchkins or something similar which were available in a set of 4 pieces. havnt been to any dunkin since an year and now i can only see that burgers and wraps have dominated their menu offerings. I think they have discontinued those dough balls kinda thing coz i cant spot them in the menu. Coming to the burgers..... I never liked them that much. Tried the tough guy which was too dry for my liking..... hardly any sauces... just a big burger with too much of bread... The second time i tried the chef speacial which was also a regular burger, nothing great. In my opinion their newest competitor is the best for burgers. To conclude i would say, it is not that bad either, and one can try it once in a while",Rated 3.0,65,108,??

RaJat AhuJa,"Rated It was a busy sunday and i along with my 5 friends was waiting for our reservation in a newly opened lounge bar to get confirmed and as we were hungry we decided to order here so we bought 2 hash brown burgers , 2 classic chicken burgers and a DBC donut . As it was a busy sunday so their wasnt any space for us to settle down and when we got one the AC their was not working . Out order was completed in 10 mins , we were served burgers without ketchup then the hash brown burgers were not upto the mark as we had them earlier , the reason is all clear due to the rush in there , though chicken burger was ok and ya lastly DBC was the best out of em . So i suggest their should be a better way and management during peak hours and days like sunday. Overall: Taste : 3.5/5 Service: 3/5",Rated 3.5,41,581,??

AG,"Rated Can't give a less than 5! I'm so in love with this place! This outlet of DD has one of the best interiors.. The sketch of whole of their connaught place on one of their walls in green colour is so beautiful! Plus their new seating arrangements(which was very much required because this place is always so full) n new interiors n designing are truly marvelous! Theirs always a queue here in but from taking your orders to serving them they do it as swiftly as they can! For food.. I never ever miss the chocolate dunkaccino with a shot of whipped cream it's such a heavenly n delectable blend of coffee n chocolate! I have never been let down on this... Joe's burger is there new thing.. It has a filling of rajma (kidney beans) sauted in some dry cravy with a crisp tikki onions cheese slice n some yum dressing ( something like mayo spices n sauces) also it has a smoky or barbecued flavour... Chefs special burger n veg sandwich too good but there's problem handling the veggies n a burger this size! Talking abt donuts, Death by chocolate is such a delectable treat.. If u want less of chocolate go for alive by chocolate.. I took home a box of 6 which is always worth wherein u get 6 donuts at the price of 5.. Chocolate cake donuts n cookie cartwheel are no less! The crunch frosting n the freshness of these donuts is amazing! For the food (from taste to serving size), staff service, ambience decor and everything 5! P.S.: For the food that couldn't be captured the reason wholly is that it was hard to wait to click a picture! It had been attacked as it arrived n empty plates wouldn't look nice for a picture ;)",Rated 5.0,30,20,??

I also ordered a Chocolate Ham and Chocolate Donut with it. We were in group of 3 Service was promp, no doubt but the burger was in bad shape, probably smashed around by the ruthless machine in the midst of high walkins so as to reduce the time, but boy I dont appreciate this kind of preparation at all. The server who had come upto us just served the food, I needed to call him all from the downstairs to ask for Sauces, Tissues and Spoon, I felt this very odd. Probably the boy was new to this.

It did not take much time for me to savor them. I found the same exquisite flavour of what I had in Germany. I love the original donut flavour and the blue berry flavour the most.

Monis Yousuf,"Rated Dunkin donuts is a place not only known for its donuts.. but also for its burgers. Being very fond of its burgers, i did not find them very impressive at this outlet as compared to others. This place offers a variety of burgers (even for vegetarians), which your McDonalds or Burger King wont. Though a bit pricy, but i find it filling. We tried:- 1. Chef's special Veg burger: It has a plain potato patty with some veggie toppings and awesome sauces. They use mostly whole grain/whole wheat bun. The bun was appearing to be a bit stale (not too much) which dimished the essence of this burger. 2. The Brute Tough Guy Veg: As much as delicious it looks, its actually not. I wont recommend trying this, as anyone who has tried this one did not love it. 3. Potato Hash Brown Burger: Normally a single burger fills you up, but if you're really hungry, this is a small one which can completely fill you. Its nice and can be definitely had as a side. Next, we tried a couple of donuts which complement each other by name.. 1. Alive By Chocolate: If you're into chocolate, this is a must have at dunkins!!! 2. Death By Chocolate: Its good and has a slight cruncy taste. I found the previous one better than this one. Overall:- 1. Hospitality: 4/5 Its self-Service, but waiters deliver at your table. Plus, if you want something extra, you can pay the waiter and ask him to get it for you. Nice attitude for a self-service outlet. 2. Cost: 3/5 I find the burgers a bit overpriced compared to other outlets. If McDonalds/BurgerKing would've been making burgers of same standard, they would've charged 70% of what dunkins charge. 3. Food: 3.5/5 Usually the burgers are great, but i was not very much impressed by this outlet. Donuts were great though..! 4. Ambiance: 4/5 Great! I find all the outlets equally good in terms of ambiance. Gives you a proper american restaurant feel..",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

And, please burger king has nothing to offer for us vegetarians.Tried naughty lucy, brute tough guy, classic tough guy, chef's special, potato hash brown, crunchy joe in veg burgers, guess that covers most/all of it :P Naughty lucy and brute tough guy are simply yummy, I can relish the taste while I write. Naughty lucy has this spicy+tangy sauce along with the dripping cheese, gives you a feel of mango chutney at times. Brute tough guy is super duper spicy, might leave you teary eyed. Potato hash brown is also good but it is more of a snack not very filling. Chef's special is just okay and crunchy joe is also fine but for a small appetite while classic tough guy I did not like. Even some of the dunkaccinos (java chip and caramel one) are nice, iced tea is good if you like the actual bitter-sweet taste of it n not the McD/nescafe iced tea version.

Talking about about the price,this place is perfect for those looking out for reasonable quality burgers with a great taste and great quantity. With its mouth watering burgers to its chocolate dip doughnuts,it has left no stone unturned. Its new addition of burgers i.e. crunchy joe veg. and chicken are perfect for a light supper in the evening with a meal for sure. Naughty Lucy Burger is one of the best burgers Dunkin' can come up with. I have not tried that brute tough guy burger yet,but with the face and expressions of one of my foodie partner i am sure it is heaven for our taste buds. And now their Doughnuts,in my opinion they prepare the best fried dough in our country.

Gurneet Kaur,"Rated Major burger cravings took us to dunkin' today. Located next to Nandos and Sbarro, this is an easy on the pocket outlet. They run various promotions which are a steal! We ordered the chocolate smoothie which was full of sugar n very ordinary. I won't have another for free let alone pay for it. It was disappointing! The regular iced tea was nice. The classic dunk was very okayish, very sugary. I don't like my beverages very sweet so was kinda disappointed on that front. The brute chicken burger was nice which a large chicken patty loaded with flavors. Though the spicy chicken wrap stole the show. Full of sauces n veggies n large chunks of chicken, I loved it! For the veggie burgers, we chose potato hash which is the cheapest burger n is nice. A little plain in terms of flavors. Wish there was enough sauce in it. Chefs special veg was recommended by the staff. It was nice though again underseasoned for my liking. The burger broke into pieces the moment i took a bite. The major disappointment was the bean burger. Too dry, hard bun, party was just not right. I have made much better patties than this. The sauce was very ordinary The best burger was the veg naughty Lucy burger. What flavors! Delicious patty n sauce. Perfectly seasoned. One burger will fill up your stomach. Must try ! My favorite donut is death by chocolate having stuffing of liquid chocolate. Finding a table can be a task here.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Komal,"Rated Its a good place for a quick bite. The Donuts are definitely good but the burgers and shakes are just abouts average. We took Classic Dunkaccino & Chocolate Dunkaccino which was ok. The tough guy burger was not good, will never order that again. The donuts - the chocolate glazed and the classic one both were nice.

Half Thalli Full,"Rated After a bike ride to CP we quickly fired up the 'Open Now' feature on zomato. Given the limited choice of places that were open, my veto against south Indian breakfast and my friend and my wish to have cold coffee, we decided to visit Dunkin Donuts. This outlet is pretty big and airy and offers a lot of seating. I thought the interiors were dine pretty well by fast food chain standards. The service was fast and polite. We ordered the following: 1) Chicken crunchy Joe burger: good burger with a deceiving name. The party isn't crunchy, more like course keema. The burger is made desi style with fried bun. Tastes pretty good if you don't mind the mess and fried bun. 2) Naughty Lucy chicken burger: the first thing that struck me after taking a bite was how similar it actually looks to what they show in their ads. The second thing was that its a great burger. The cheese and the mango salsa elevate it beyond most fast food burgers. 3) Donuts and cold coffee: we had a couple of donuts, both of which were good. The cold coffees were great, specially the one with butterscotch. Overall Iam glad that dunkin donuts is more that just about donuts and coffee. I'm glad its about burgers too.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Srishty,"Rated Since Dukin Donuts opened in India they have been launching new dishes every few months, and this time it's the Crunchy Joe Burger. Coming to it later. For now, the ambience of their Cp branch is fun, quirky and comfy. If you want to hang out with friends I say go for the first floor seating, with sofas, high chairs and music. If you want to grab a quick bite their downstairs seating has pop-up color chairs and wooden tables, with people hustling everywhere. The service is great ! So much better than the other branches. The overall quality too, is much better. (specially comparing to the ambience gurgaon branch). Food Review : Crunchy Joe Burger - The latest addition to their long range of burgers. The potato bun is super crunchy along with a tangy, spicy chicken filling , that tingles your taste buds and leaves you wanting more. Cheese and Chicken Cupwich : If you are looking for a small bite, this is ideal. Chunks of Spicy tangy chicken in combination with cheese (lots of it!) in a bowl shaped cup base. A must try indeed ! Paprika Salami Croissant Sandwich : I hate nothing more than a dead croissant, and this was exactly that ! Just a huge flop! The stuffing was great, overloaded with salami, lettuce, onions and their signature spicy chilli mayo, however nothing could make up for that inflated croissant. Lemon Iced Tea : It's not for you, if you are used to the Nescaf iced tea powder. However, I loved it ! Favourite Donuts : Bavarian Kreme, Jelly filled. Overall, it's a great place to hangout with friends, grab a nice burger followed by donuts. Update : I recently visited Dunkin Donuts again and to my horror, the second visit was nothing like the first one. Consistency in the quality and preparation of food is one of the most important things in the food industry and sadly, Dunkin Donuts completely lacks any consistency. The Crunchy Joe burger which I absolutely loved before was soggy and deficient of the pungent sauce which tied all the flavours together. The Original Tough Guy Burger was no better. The quality of salami isn't that great and the burger was cold. The service too wasn't as good as before. Our order took almost 30mins and was still cold ! Dunkin Donuts completely disappointed and hence I'm reducing its rating from 4.0 to 3.0 . They do have really nice seating for large groups and some comfortable, cosy settings for a nice hangout place with friends, which is pretty much the only reason I'm still giving it 3.0 rating. lebensmittelsite.wordpress.com",Rated 3.0,43,139,??

Sankalp Sharma,"Rated The CP outlet of dunking donuts is one of a kind, its not similar to the other outlets. White brick walls, with hanging art, with high tables for two and even a table with chairs having huge backs. This is very different from the regular interiors of Dunkin which are always bright. Anyways we were there to try the new burger of course, Chicken Crunchy Joe. We also ordered a chicken Naughty Lucy, a large mocha chip and a side of hash browns. With Dunkin spread over two floors ,We took a seat upstairs after choosing a seat right underneath the AC where we were shortly served with our order. The dunkacino was shockingly bad , dont expect the same quality as of other outlets like Rajouri. The Naughty Lucy wasnt as good as heard. The hot patty should have the cheese oozing out but sadly , we merely tasted it. The burger bun was amazing on the other hand, lined with bell peppers and jalapeos made the burger passable. The new Crunchy Joe burger was epic. A Really Crunchy bun with spicy minced chicken an amazing dressing and crushed lettuce and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Its similar to sloppy joe which is a sandwich burger consisting of ground beef and dressing of Worcestershire sauce except this one had chicken. This was another top class burger server at Dunkin.A must have :D",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Isha Saxena,"Rated What makes me an ardent Dunkin fan are the new additions to their menu that make you return to this place over and over again. And after the huge success of the Naughty Lucy, it was time to test Crunchy Joe's skills to impress. This was my first proper visit to the CP outlet having ordered take-aways before. White brick walls, black chalkboard art and the unique assortment of furniture came as a fresh change to the otherwise bright Dunkin interiors. We ordered the new kid of course, Chicken Crunchy Joe, a chicken Naughty Lucy, a large mocha chip and a side of hash browns. We took a seat upstairs where we were shortly served with our order. The dunkaccino was bit of a blow - not as thick as the ones at other outlets. The hash browns were crispy and delectable as always. The Naughty Lucy was not upto the mark. Cheese should have been oozing out of the patty but we could barely taste any cheese at all. The patty was juicy with interesting flavours of bell peppers and jalapeos. The Crunchy Joe stole the show. A very crunchy bun with sumptuous minced chicken, onions, dressing and lettuce. The intermingling flavours of the minced chicken and crunchy bun were very palatable. An excellent take on the classic sloppy joe's. A must have! chompslurrpburp.wordpress.com",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Ritika Roy,Rated Dunkin Donuts is a great place for a quick snack. When you are tired of roaming around in CP you can always go there for small relaxation and a scrumptious bite. Donuts are amazing especially if you get them heated a bit. We had Classic Glazed & Chocolate Frosted. Both were very satisfying and nice. Also tried the Classic Dunkaccino that was good but was not very happy with the Burger as the taste was not that great. I guess one should stick to Donuts and Shakes only while visiting this place as this is their specialty. For Burgers of course we have Mc D & Burger King. So not their fault.

(already in love with your donuts <3 ) Craving for something light and delicious we went to Dunkin' just to try their spicy veg burger. Ambiance: The ambiance is good! The seats are colourful and very comfortable. Good music! You have plenty of space to sit as they have divided the total area into an upper and ground floor. The upper portion is pretty good but I personally found it a bit suffocating, probably because the AC was not working. The walls are beautifully decorated to make the environment more lively and active. Staff: Quick and efficient. We were served in less than 10 minutes. Food: VERY GOOD! Burgers were saucy enough to keep the ketchup away from me- the thing I loved the most! and also, the patties were crisp! Overall a good experience! Will be back again :)",Rated 3.5,43,450,??

Kul Bhushan,"Rated It is tough to review a food chain store, as they are consistent across the city, and more or the less have similar set of services. I just visited the N-Block outlet. The store unlike the one we have in The Great India Place mall in Noida seems little smaller and perhaps congested. I was at the ground floor, which I found little inconvenient (but as is the case with KFC and McD in CP).First floor, however, seems better, only challenge is you don't get to order food on that floor. Coming back to the main thing - that is food -- it was alright. Liked the wrapping of veg and non veg wraps I had ordered. Ketchup was okayish - and overall looked like any other food outlet. Dunkin needs to understand the Indian taste buds. I found their non veg not so wicket wrap little tangy, perhaps unlike what North Indians crave for at 5pm in evening. The roll could have been hotter and thinner. Pros: Speedy service, neatness, location Cons: Congested sitting arrangement, lesser warmer food, lack of variety.",Rated 3.0,3,21,??

I would recommend the Tough Guy series of burgers. They are too huge and tasty. The bun is soft and fresh...the burgers are a little on the spicy side but offer a new kind of taste which Mcd and Burger King of the world do not offer.

This CP branch went through a major overhaul and renovation with respect to its interiors, furniture and wall arts and paintings. As I have been a regular visitor I can tell the difference and I must say that this has been good for the franchise. Most importantly I can see more visitors here than ever before. Food is all same and of good quality. No compromises with that. Since its a donut speciality therefore you should go for them but also try shakes, and burgers. Personally this outlet holds a lot of significance for me and my college society as all are event and activities have been planned here, every damn Sunday.

Rajeev Nangia,"Rated Walking , post lunch ,in the corridors of CP , enjoying the freak , pleasant weather earlier today , looking at all the new establishments that have mushroomed here , I suddenly came across the familiar Dunkin Doughnut logo. And with that came memories of ,what arguably was the most robust coffee in any quick serve restaurant I have had in the USA. So I decided to walk in to reintroduce my taste buds to that flavour. During my visits to USA , whenever it was about yummy Doughnuts , first choice was always Krispy Kream but if it was coffee , it had to be Dunkins. As I walked in , the first thing that impressed me in this , not so big , outlet was the warm and open feel , inc outages by the same I stood in the long Que. to place my order. The place was quite full and the wait time in the Que. real long. As I was placing the order for my large Americano and a cold Latte for my friend , I wondered why none of the MNC quick serve chain do not serve the plain smple filter coffee , like they do in their home markets and instead served only higher price barista brewed brews ? On placing the order I was handed a no and was told that my order would be served on my table , I need not wait for it by the counter. After an abnormal 10 minute wait the coffees finally arrived. One sip from my cup and I crash landed in reality from the dream world I was flying in , the brew was very mild and now hear near the hearty , robust flavour of Dunkin's house blend , internationally . Maybe they have toned down the flavour in line with Indian taste buds , whatever , I was heart broken. However here let me hasten to add that all six of the assorted doughnuts I had ordered to go with the coffee were outright heavenly , so some redemption. So am I going back ? Yes , but never for my breakfast fix , because a breakfast doughnut needs to be accompanied by a great cuppa coffee , but will surely visit again sometime for by post meal sugar fix . A nice desert. Hey befor I forget , these guys also serve quite a range of burgers , which , of course , I did not try , after all you do not go to a place , whose claim to fame , as immortalised in its name itself , is Doughnuts and eat burgers there. :) maybe some time in future , when they introduce breakfast sandwiches , but till then Doughnuts , it is.

Its a nice experiment .Caramel Butterscotch is HIGHLY recommended.

Didn't expect much from it due to its pricing but it impressed my taste buds just like the other one I had last Sunday. Ambience is totally awesome for the price they offer their products for.

The burgers have fared excessively well in the market and customers have generally given a positive feedback. The Brute Tough guy burger lives up to its name of ""acting"" tough on the palette. The tangy flavors on the meat are strong and the bagel buns offer a distinctive experience compared to the regular buns at McD and KFC. Personally, I'm not too impressed with it but would recommend it to anyone who's looking to try something different among the large burger restaurant chains. Please don't bother with the hot chocolate. It is a disaster. I've tried their hot chocolate at three different DD outlets and I would only recommend the Nehru Place outlet for the beverage.

Tanya Jain,Rated Dunkin Donuts is situated in N Block of Connaught Place and is very easily visible. It has always been one of the most popular meeting place for me. More than the Donuts its the seating space which it offers which makes it comfortable for quick meetings. Though always crowded yet its a delight in the sense that one fills up in a very nominal out. I have tried almost everything here from wraps to burgers to donuts ofcourse. It's Delicious. Its economical. Its worth it. Bingo!

Amar Arjun,"Rated So, me and my friends were really hungry after giving our Mid sem exams and were starving for some good food. I insisted on either going to the good old 'Wood box Cafe' or 'Cha Bar' at CP as i wanted to try it out. But, my suggestions were quickly struck down as no one was in the mood to experiment or take any chances with the taste of the food. So, two names were finally short-listed by them , KFC and Dunkin' Donuts (I hate these the likes of KFC and MCdonalds). After a lot of convincing that DD serve good savory items too, they agreed on Dunkin' Donuts. We went to the Dunkin' Donuts in the N block , this outlet is really spacious and is spread on 2 floors with vast seating arrangement. After going through the menu, we ordered 2 'Classic Chicken Burgers' , 1 'Heaven Can Wit Burger' and 2 'Triple Choco Nuts'. It took almost 15 mins for the food to arrive which is really disappointing, i mean come on you are a fast food joint !!!!!. The Classic Chicken burger had a fresh bun, it was good in size, had a decent filling (although they should reduce the amount of raw onion) and the patty was a bit dry, overall the burger tasted good. The 'Heaven Can Wait' burger was a great disappointment, it had a very complex flavor, the amount of sauce was less and it was quite bland. I was happy that i did not order it but 1 bite was enough to know how it tasted ( RIP 190 bucks :P) ! The donuts were really great, crisp and chocolaty on the outside and soft and salty inside and we were happy. It was an OKish experience, partly because of wrong menu selection maybe, but i would point out that i was really upset by the manager who stopped me from clicking pics as it was according to him"" AGAINST COMPANY POLICY"" -_-.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Vandita_Roaming Gastronaut,"Rated Welcome to the most grand Dunkin Donuts outlet. This one sprawls across two floors and is very spacious. The ground floor has the kitchen area, main counter and seating area. The floor above is exclusively seating. The staff members of all CP outlets are generally very agile and professional as they are experienced in handling customers round the clock, as the center of Delhi never sleeps. The service here as well remains very prompt and the staff is experienced. A bustling outlet is also synonymous with fresh stock of food, which made their donuts and burgers delightful to eat. We ordered a pack of six donuts and they were all so soft and fresh. One of the rare instances when I liked doughnuts at Dunkin Donuts. Totally yumm!! Besides this, we ordered Not so wicked wrap veg, brute tough guy chicken burger, java mocha chip dunkaccino and jaimaican rum & almonds dunkaccino. I am not a big fan of their wraps yet. I think they go overboard with the sauce and makes the taste too tangy and overpowering. I do like the filling of the not so wicked wrap of cottage cheese and lot of veggies. The wicked wrap is extremely spicy so I would recommend going for the not-so-wicked version if you cant handle spicy food. Until now, I used to think that one needs a big appetite for the tough guy burgers and heaven can wait burger but Dunkin Donuts took the concept of massive burgers to the next level with their brute tough guy burgers. This range is definitely for the hungry! :P We had ordered a brute tough guy chicken burger. It comes in a different bun than the rest of the burgers. The bun itself is quite big. It is filled with lettuce, red, yellow, and green bell pepper, minced chicke and herbs. Alongwith their star ingredient of harissa sauce, this one also has spicy mayo in it. Truly brutal !!! roaminggastronaut.wordpress.com",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

My favourite here is Choco Dunkacinno and death by chocolate which I order almost every time I happen to be here. The donuts here are always fresh and the coffee tastes so creamy, chocolaty and strong, just the way I like it. The burgers here deserve a special mention. The bun they use has a taste of his own and most of the burgers are much better than those of McD. Although there's still some scope for improvement when it comes to the chocolate donuts. The restaurant scores well on the ""Value for money"" meter also. The staff is quite generous and the decor with the music playing in the background makes it a place where you can sit and be relaxed.

Though, Donuts were available at many places that time but international brands surely bring some change to the existing ones. I'm not a big fan of donuts, but tried few of them and loved the chocolate ones. Even the coffees are pretty good and can give healthy competition to other coffee brands. New menu lined up including various options like brutt burger and all other burgers are awesome and no one should miss them. There are various combos which is a very good option to choose from such a large variety of items. Prices are farely placed and sudexo's are accepted too which is always a upper hand for working class. Not giving a complete 5 rating as few more options in drinks menu can be considered.

Their Orange Coolattas was something that I tried along with the donuts once! It was crushed ice treated with orange flavor and served with Straw! It was indeed cooling but too much of ice wasnt really pleasing with the donuts. Their chocolate Milkshake is something that I never miss! Its too good!

Samrat Ray,Rated This is one of the few fast food joints that had compelled me to shed few words of appreciation..But this review is strictly dedicated to the awesome wraps of dunkin donuts!!! After coming across their catchy pictures and the caption lines in the newspaper almost everyday on their super WICKED wraps i was quite enticed to try them out... So i decided to go for the wicked chicken wrap one hungry afternoon!!!...(despite the warning given by the sale person: Sir u r sure u want to take this one...its very spicy!!!)...The best part about the wrap is the very light and thin multigrain covering...so you don't end up feeling filled up to the brim...But a warning would be: take the wrap with a donuts...because you would surely need it to extinguish the fire generated in your mouth after the wrap!!!.. The chicken wrap mix is a combination of spicy pepper and raw mango sauce with cheese and yellow bell peppers and onion rinds...with every bite of the wrap you would surely crave for more despite shedding some tears!!!...Definitely way better than the wraps in the contemporary KFCs Mc donalds n stuff!!!...A must must try!!! Try the Bavarian chocolate and the hazelnut donuts...Tastes best when just slightly warmed!!!...The centre is filled with molten gooey icing n butter/hazelnut crme...it oozes with every bite to create magic in your mouth...Indeed a sweet ending to your snack time!!! The caramel butterscotch col coffee and the chocolate shakes are decent!!! The only minus point in the whole experience was the meagre miserly amount of tissues they provide on the tables...and unfortunately on the day of our visit the ACs were not functioning properly!!!...so it was quite a brutal experience to bear the dual heat: inside n outside our mouth!!!.. But all in all...surely go for the wraps!!!...Presently the best among all the fast food joints!!!,Rated 4.0,91,713,??

Kashika Jain,"Rated though it is famous for its donuts, i mainly go there for their amazing burgers and beverages. have tried their heaven can wait(non veg) and tough guy chicken burger, both of which are absolutely delectable. they are also pretty filling. in beverages, the choc and caramel butterscotch dunkaccino are both equally delicious and thick shakes. coming to the donuts, have tried many, both round and filled, but found alive by chocolate the best. dusted with chocolate on top and filled with molten choc inside, it is yummy. their sandwiches are good not exceptional. the best one is paprika chicken salami sandwich. they have a reward point system, for every 25 rs u get 1 point...and for 120 points, u get a flat 50% discount. u can also avail 10,20 or 30% discount based on the no. of points u have collected. the maximum discount is however limited to rs.300. also, they have nice deals which help u save. on my last visit tho, i was disappointed to see that my favorite deal has been replaced by the new wraps deal :( the only fault is that this outlet does not have good air conditioning. had we not been sitting right next to the blower, would have found it tooo stuffy inside.",Rated 4.0,10,14,??

HR,"Rated Though I've been to Dunkin Donuts a couple of times to enjoy their doughnuts, we recently went to have lunch. We ordered the a Not so Wicked Non Veg Wrap and a Classic Mutton Burger (this is one of the few fastfood joints left which still serves a Mutton burger !), and the food was surprisingly good. Combined with Classic Dunkaccino, it would've made for an ideal meal. However, the Air Conditioning of the outlet never works (as per my experience from the last 4 -5 visits), and even the blower barely manages to circulate any air. In the absence of fans, closed doors, frequent visitors and an open kitchen, one almost wonders if the good food is a worthwhile trade off for the oppressive conditions. Overall: 3.5 (only because the food was fabulous and the service is good, despite their working temperatures) Service: 3 Food: 4.5 Ambiance: 1.5",Rated 3.5,80,367,??
Parth Rohan Singh,"Rated Whenever I visited conaught place I used to crave for good places to eat a snack or two. My earlier destinations were the KFC or the McDonald's until I visited dunkin. The special thing about this place is a vide range of menu and affordable prices. The quality of food that they provide is best in their competitive brands of food chains. I visited the place with my two buddies and we ordered Potatohash burgers, a not so wicked wrap and donuts ofcourse and the food was just exquisite. The taste was different for every dish and was unique and I would like to point out that it's the best wrap I ever had so far. The food is twice the quality as compared to other brands and almost the same price. Moving on to the Interiors, the restaurant is well furnished and since it has twin floor seating there is ample space to Chuck in a large crowd. The environment of the place is good and you can expect to have a great time with your friends as nobody interrupts you or hassles you. Seems like the dunkin chain has something promising that will convince you to return to that place and also the food will bound you to change your choice from other restaurants to this one. The one drawback I found was the service is a liitle slow. Either is the lack of staff or it is the lack of production capabilities but the average services time can go upto 10-15 mins depending upon the rush. But the food quality is worth the wait I guess. So my suggestion is that if you stroll on CP a lot and you are bored of your ususals atleast visit this place once who knows it might become your usual. It is mine now!",Rated 4.0,50,172,??

The price makes it reasonable on any day of the week, and they've got good combos too. I don't really like their donuts as much, but the Wicked Veg Wrap, Potato Hash Brown burger and Cream Cheese Bagel are some of my favorite picks! I'm not a fan of green tea, so their drinks don't really please me, but I'm yet to try their chocolate shake, so we'll see how that goes. ;) I'm taking away half a point because they've discontinued by favorite Irish flavored donut, darn! :(",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

We tried the Heaven can wait, Tough Guy Burger & Smoked Mutton Burger. Huge, chunky and meaty is all I can describe them as. We were surprised that their burger breads are so awesome, then why couldnt they replicate the same with their donuts?!! The staff is wonderful, though we did have to personally go up to them and ask them to warm the Donuts twice. Despite this, the staff was friendly and welcomed us with a smile. The brand has some serious potential to grow big and like every other American fast food chain they too need to just figure, what gets us Indians ticking.",Rated 3.5,17,158,??

Sanskriti P,"Rated This outlet is situated in CP. The outlet is pretty spacious and always abuzz with young college goers and the like. We had our table on the first floor..so u need to order downstairs and the food is served at your table. We ordered a fresh veg. Sandwich, a veg wicked wrap and classic duncaccino. The wrap is worth every penny! It was heavenly, very spicy and had a very tangy and spicy mango flavoured chutney inside. What was unique about the wrap and which I liked the most were the crispy nachos inside. Also, it is heavy and filling. So that is a must try. Apart from that, the sandwich was not too flavourful and we didnt like it much. So one can skip it. The dunkaccino was good and the texture was fine, but I found it a little too sweet for my liking..nevertheless, it did taste fine. The place is very lively, especially the first floor, and had a very informal vibe to it. The service is quick and the staff is polite. Overall, a great experience!",Rated 3.0,68,4702,??

Otherwise, everything else is great, especially the cupwiches, the coffees... everything. I like the iced tea here. It is not overly sweet. Also the donuts are my favourite. The quality is phenomenal. Once I got the diwali special gulab-jamun donut, and my god, the tiny gulab jamun in the hole of the donut was phenomenal! THAT is called dedication to quality.

I Loe Food,"Rated The love for food is truly greater than any other kind of love. Dunkin' Donuts has been in business for a long time and people all over the world have loved and supported it. Now it's time for India. There is a reason why a brand goes this big. It cannot be attributed to just good service, freshness or timely delivery. It has to be taste. Taste is what distinguishes and brings us back to the food we love or crave. My love with Dunkin' Donuts is such. When I crave a donut nothing in the world can stop me from wanting to come and get one. The plain sugar glazed donuts are a piece of heaven in your mouth. The taste is something that you will not be able to erase from your mind ever. The tiny bits of textured sugar grains with tender dough with a hot cup of coffee is the best combination you can ever imagine as a snack. Another such fabulous combination is the chocolate glazed donut. Premium quality cocoa is used in these preparations and that gives Dunkin' Donuts an edge over the competition. The service is friendly and there are no complaints there. britishchippysfoodadventures.blogspot.com",Rated 4.0,173,2116,??
Shobhit,"Rated The very night after visiting the DDs. Flashes of a burger and a slight mumbling of 'smoo chh buuur'.. Followed by a scream, SMOKED CHICKEN BURGER!! Hell yeah, that is exactly how amazing this burger is. Not something as lavish as the ones served in outlets like Fork you and Garage inc. but it had it's own charm. It tastes exactly how a burger should, JUICY AND CRUNCHY at the same time. You can taste the amazing smoky feel of the chicken followed by the crunch of the lettuce. And the best part, the way the burger is done, nothing spills out and even the bun taste good. Even tried a donut, to complete the feel of the visit and do justice to the name of the place. Had a very very blueberry donut, it was good, would recommend it to eveyone who is not into chocolates much like me. In the end, bhai washroom.

The bread crumbled too much and spices are not balanced.",Rated 3.5,5,11,??
Ankita,"Rated In life everything and everyone moves on. Why not? You get better things to choose from. Strange enough that hasn't been the case for Dunkin. I love their donuts more than MOD any day. They are softer and lighter. Toffee nought and the Bavarian chocolate are the best according to me. The munchkins are equally good. Funny enough, now-a-days I like their burgers and sandwiches more than the donuts. Nothing wrong with the donuts but for the moment I'm in the Krispy Kreme original glazed phase. :) Anyway, the mutton burger and the pepper chicken are my favourite. The patties are juicy, soft, spiced well, not oily and can be further crisped on request. The sauces compliment the patty and the bun is firm yet soft. The tough guy chicken bagel is definitely meaty. The chorizo sausage, the chicken patty with the veggies and mustard is absolutely delicious. The bagel is soft. Overall this burger is pretty huge and I suggest getting it halved for a non-messy experience. The potato hash is another burger which is simple but lip smacking good. The hash browns are brilliant here. Among the sandwich the chicken croissant is another favourite. The croissants are buttery, and the filling is great. Not a fan of shakes and hot coffee. I usually take an iced tea which I like actually a lot. Fresh lemon slices and mint with not too sweet concoction makes it a flavourful drink. This outlet is open till midnight which us plus point. Also the offers at Dunkin are amazing. The combos are competitively prices. Do register yourself next time you visit any of their counters.

I heard good reviews about their burgers, so thought to give it a try. Their smoked chicken burgers are quite tasty. I would recommend these over the plain chicken ones at McDonalds. But besides this burger, the remaining food is quite low quality with stale ingredients.",Rated 3.0,12,9,??

I tried the Heaven can wait burger, a pepper based burger and the tough guy burger. All of them have been amazing.. Its a great change and every burger has a good separate taste to it!

It's a bagel sandwich not a burger . It a good bagel sandwich . I have tried the veg version and it's really jaw breaking . The crusty veg patty is good , the cheese , salad and the English mustard they use are amazing . I think it will sell more if they just call it sandwich which is the trust as people are ore health conscious now days and would love to know if the bagels are fried or baked at Dunkin Donuts ----- 21 Jul, 2013 ----- This place is were wimpyburger operated and closed down giving it's huge place to mcdonalds , dominos and dunkin donuts . Dunkin donut got it name from a handle shaped donut which could be dunked in the hot coffee and drank away . seeing all the american sitcom and hollywood movies Donut seems a staple food of all the cops in the US. Food - Most of the donuts are friends but some are bakes as well . They have eggless versions as well . The taste of dunkin is better than mad over donuts as i found MOD to be very sweets and nothing else . Dunkin is a complete package with good coffee and sandwiches. I have tried most of them and loved the bread which they use in their sandwiches . Egg and cheese , mushroom are the best one i have tasted till date from their menu . Not many people are the fan of cold Black coffee beside me and walden schmidt lol .. love it with donuts and all .

Shashank Kumar Nair,"Rated Dunkin continues to serve quality burgers. My latest order was for a heaven can wait chicken, chefs special veg and the new tough guy chicken burger. I have already reviewed the first two and they were as good as my previous experience. Top marks to Dunkin for maintaining its consistency. Since, my order was a takeaway I requested I be served the tough guy burger in a bun and not a bagel. Even without that this burger is another delicious innovation from the Dunkin team, Chorizzo chicken patty, layers of paprika chicken and lots of mustard- it is quite an experience. The paprika chicken in particular blends in beautifully with the patty and the sauces. An overall bill of Rs 564/- might be a bit skewed on the higher side, but quality comes at a price and this place certainly has the former in abundance. ----- 18 Aug, 2013 ----- I have to admit I am fan of all things Dunkin except for the Donuts! For an outlet which has donuts in its brand name the quality of donuts its a crying shame. Their CP outlet has an amazing ambience and is a great place to have a relaxed meal. By ordering experience was ruined a bit, because the guy at the counter seemed to be having a bad day and wasnt talking properly to customers. But, I was here to try the Heaven can wait Chicken and the Chef Special Veg Burgers. The heaven can wait chicken burger lives up to its name. The first bite gives you a feeling that no other burger chain in India has offered so far. The whole wheat bun is a Dunkin speciality and it really is something. The burger contains two different patties one seekh style and the other in tikka style. They are both brilliantly done. Together with a good spread of veggies, the burger offers a heavenly taste indeed. The Veg Burger is basically a stuffing potato wedges and veggies. But the wedges are so nicely done and their special mayo is so delicious that you would really enjoy it. For a vegetarian, this burger is as good as a heaven can wait chicken is for a non vegetarian. Well done, Dunkin, you really have aced it this time with these burgers. ----- 07 Jun, 2012 ----- Brilliant place, great ambience, the chicken jalapeno in ciabatta bread is pure delight.

Sheenam Puri,"Rated Have reviewed this place before and would give them a 4 this time. This is not for the much hyped dunkachino or the Donuts which are extra sweet, rather I always prefer eating the munchkins instead. The best part about this place is, that its very very close to our office and they deliver too! Have been ordering a lot since 2 weeks, and mainly the snacks and the sandwiches. To start with their new range of burgers and sandwiches. I have tried both their veg and non veg recommendations. The Chef's Special Veg Burger is really delicious. Its HUGE and has a biggg slice of cheese and nearly 3 aaalo patties! Loved every bite of it. Have this in the evening and you would definitely skip dinner that night! The Heaven Can Wait burger is a combination of Smoked chicken burger and Pepper chicken burger and tastes good too. It was huge too and both the patties were packed with flavor. The buns were soft and the burgers were served hot. The mediterranean mushroom sandwich is also a good option. Basically like a sub but loaded with mushrooms and onions and a little bit of mayo and spicy sauce in it. The mushroom quiche is the most enjoyable quick bite option for me. I absolutely love the mushroom filling with onions and white sauce. The spicy veg burger is good too and is loaded with loads of fresh veggies. Sadly their donuts are a let down! The only good donut they have is the Death-by-chocolate, which is sold out by every evening I guess. The irish coffee donut is just another good option and is a filled donut with coffee cream inside. I ahve also tried their toffee nogut donut and its pretty ordinary and has a caramel filling inside. The berry donut and the chocolate bawarian can be given a miss. They also have started a new one called the ""allive by chocolate"" which is more or less like the death by chocolate but only addition that its covered with some crumbly fudgy crushed choco cookies I suppose. Most of all I love the Munchkins here! They have been my favorite and are great value for money too! A pack of 10 little munchkins (donut holes) costs 110 inc taxes and they have 3 options for the same (Sugar coated, bavarian custard, chocolate filled). The custard is my favorite and I usually get all 10 for custard itself :p The service is quick but make sure you ask the server to revise the order once for you, because a lot goes out for take away and the orders here get mixed too! It happened once with us and we got the wrong box of donuts (pack of 6) but the server was quick enough to come to our office and get the new ones for us :) ----- 29 Nov, 2013 ----- Unlike others who visit this place for its wonderful variety of donuts, I visit this place for its spicy vegetarian sandwich! 2 huge breads almost dipped in butter n seasoned so well packed with lotssss of jalepenos and roasted bell peppers and lots of cheese, this sandwich is really a delight! Must try! Among the coffees, their cold coffees are really tasty specially the choco cold coffee. Apart from this, obviously the yummy donuts, death by chocolate being the most popular and my personal favorite too. Then cafe is very neat and clean and offers seating on both the floors and its a lovely place to have a yum cup of coffee accompanied by sinful donuts and a wonderful bunch of friends :) ----- 24 Jan, 2013 ----- After the opening of the CP outlet, I almost addicted to their yummy Donuts but after a while got bored with the same. The very very popular Dunkin Donuts offers a LOT of variety of Donuts and its cheaper than Mad over Donuts, which on the other hand offers just about 10-12 varieties. What I love the most about DD is ""MUNCHKINS"". They have 3 varieties - chocolate, plain and custard. They even offer a pack of 3, 5 or 10 with our choice of munchkins. Highly recommended. Negatives : Although they offer a large variety of chocolate iced donuts, they have absolutely nothing with white chocolate. And also, some of their donuts are just TOOOOO sweet. foodonmyplatebysheenam.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,118,1863,??

Durvankur Surendra Patil,"Rated It was my first day in the capital city of India and I was pretty clueless, as to where should I have my first meal. I had done a bit of research before coming down to Delhi and found out that Dunkin Donuts is amongst one of the best places to eat a filling breakfast. As luck would have it, my hotel was located near Connaught Place and I could just take a walk to look around for this place. Connaught Place is actually a very huge and locating restaurants might be a little taxing job. This point is applicable to only those people, who are not from Delhi. A quick look on the GPS and I found Dunkin Donuts on one of the blocks on the Outer ring Road. The atmosphere inside DD is nothing different from any fast food joint. Yes, they have done the dcor a little better than McDs, but nothing that could stand out for you to go Wow!! over it. Well, ambiance is not something that matters to me much, as much as the food does. Being a newbie in the town, I went by my instincts and placed an order for Chicken BBQ Sandwich and a Strawberry Milkshake. The sandwich was not something that I had expected and was totally let down by the entire assembly. It had a very meager filling of Chicken between 2 breads, layered with a mild sauce. They had thrown in a bit of lettuce to add some glamour, but it falls flat on its face. Subway, probably adds more Chicken in their subs; thats now what I feel. On the other hand, the Strawberry shake was very refreshing and soothing, considering the sun already at its peak over Delhi. I was expecting a lot more from this place, which was one of the most recommended on CPs list. I guess, the Donuts would have been a better option to go for, but then I had to fill my stomach with something more substantial. The total bill came to around Rs.250, which could have been a bit curtailed, in the wake of the sandwich being average.",Rated 3.0,171,1145,??
Mayank Swarup,"Rated Well finally, its about time for my first review on Zomato...there was something about the burgers at Dunkin' that has forced me to move from just reading to writing. Honestly, I wasn't a fan of the donuts at Dunkin' as I'm not much of a sweet tooth, but their burgers have changed it all and now I'm going to be one of their most regular customers. Being a hardcore non-vegetarian, I ordered the 'Heaven can wait burger' and it was simply out of this world. It had a combination of two types of chicken patties, delectable spices and sauces which left me wanting for more. I also had a bite of the 'Veg Spicy burger' and it was easily the best vegetarian burger I had ever had, and it made me realize that burgers are not all about the 'tikki' as we Indians have known them to be. The combo offer made the whole deal more than reasonable (Rs.400) considering it included a drink and a top-of-the-line burger. Dunkin' can give the likes of McDonald's and KFC a run for their money if they open more outlets in and around Delhi.",Rated 4.5,6,156,??

It had put my ex- favourite burger (chicken maharaja mac at McD) to shame. It is really juicy and tasty. Thought priced at rs.170, close to the complete maharaja mac meal, it seems a lil expensive.

Honestly,I was sick of McD serving the same 3 burgers from the past grazillion years and dunkin is my escape and that to a great one. Their chefs special burger is really very very good. For some reason the bun of the burger is very light so even the burger which size wise is pretty big,is still very light on the stomach. The burgers are around 80 to 110 rupees which is not very costly. Their ice teas are one of the best ice teas. They are authentic and not the regular nestea ice teas.

Nitai Utkarsh,"Rated It is one of those weekday mornings when you haven't had any food hitting the belly and in addition, have that extra hour you can squeeze in before the next meeting. As we walk through the doors of Dunkin' Donuts and I notice the name extension in the form of ""& more"", I smile to myself, recollecting the various ad campaigns around their new food additions, especially the ""Heaven Can Wait"" burgers. The place is buzzing and the ground floor of this refurbished CP outlet is almost full. People here are cheerful for a weekday morning, smiling and talking to each other, reminiscent of a typical European or American cafe with the right mix of teenagers, middle aged couples and a few senior citizens adding to the melee. All of them seem to be reasonably satisfied with what they have had of the Dunkin' experience so far. As the ambiance sinks in and we make our way towards the ordering counter, we can see some really tantalizing pictures of food and for once, I feel happy to see that there are almost an equal number of vegetarian as the non-vegetarian options on the menu (not to mention the egg containing food). The display cabinet is full of colorful and inviting doughnuts which by themselves can complete a menu and make you drool. As we are busy taking all this in and deciding our order, we are greeted by the server behind the counter with that cheerful yet professional smile, something that tells you that she is going to be nice and yet quick and effective, something which we take to immediately. She helps us through our order of one Heaven can wait burger, one veg chef's special burger, a snacky cupwich and a couple of doughnuts (classic glazed and death by chocolate). We are informed that if we order beverages (which we were about to, anyway), we will get the doughnuts free and we readily accept the suggestion, ordering a couple of iced teas. As we find a place for ourselves on the crowded floor, we can't help but overhear some of the conversations around us. We see the teenager on the table next to us drooling over the dripping chocolate from her doughnut as she feeds some of it to her friend sitting next to her. The early-thirties couple next to us is busy digging into the burgers with a pretty satisfied smile playing on their faces. We are talking about the origin of Dunkin' as the server comes over with our food, a big smile, and a sincere sounding ""what else can I do for you"". The food, in one word, is delicious. The burgers are juicy and cheesy (pun unintended) and the beverages potent (some may not like it but the distinct tea flavor in the iced tea does it for me)...and the doughnuts... Just a moment ago, I was benignly smiling at the foolishness of today's yuppie generation and the way they exaggerate when it comes to anything, even a simple doughnut...and there I was, sucking the last drop of molten chocolate dripping from mine...simply divine. If there could have been a more cheerful start to the day, I haven't been fortunate enough to witness many of those. A buzzing ambiance, some really genuine (apparently at least) staff, and some finger-licking food, Dunkin' has it all to make it big in the Indian market.",Rated 5.0,29,128,??

Pros: They've recently expanded their menu to squeeze in burgers, croissants, etc, which are a good value for money, once in a while. It's larger compared to other branches, eg Saket. Cons: However, being in CP, it's noisy, and you cannot sit there for hours. The original DD menu isn't great either. The coffee isn't very good, definitely not worth the price, the donuts are far lesser as compared to MoD and they've ripped off the Choco Bomb.

Srj,"Rated Dunkin Donuts is not just a chain famous for donuts anymore!! Now all of a sudden they have become more of a burger and sandwich serving restaurant and the change is more than welcome. The new burgers are a delight and there is good variety available. P.s: The review is just for their savory stuff and not the donuts and if at all if you would like to read that then please read my review of their Punjabi bagh outlet. I visited DD at Cp a couple of days back as I really wanted to try their new burger range which looked very tempting. The outlet has come up in place of the now Wimpy's and decor wise is nicely done up over 2 floors with some bright and nice seating options. Taste and preparation wise, the really good thing is that they use a Bran wheat bun bread for all the burgers which adds a healthy touch, the hash brown burger was good but tasted just like putting a hash into a bun with some toppings. The Chef's special burger was the best burger of the 3 we had and I can say amongst the best burgers I have ever had. The patty had good stuffing of potatoes etc, was fried and super crisp, the bell peppers and other toppings really went well with the burger. The green burger is for the health conscious foodie as it has a hara kebab type patty which did taste fine along with the other toppings but the taste does remind you that it is a healthier burger. I had a pina colada coolata mocktail and it was filled with ice and was nice but was too sweet. This was not the end of the meal and my friend ordered for a Spicy grilled veg sandwich and the pickles, peppers etc in it felt a little out of place and overall tasted just decent at best. Service was slow and does need some improvement now and that is why I haven't gone in with a higher rating and honestly if allowed would have given it a 3.75/5. This service issue can be due to the fact that the staff now also has to make 8 type of burgers and other stuff which takes time to churn out but I also felt that they were short staffed. Our sandwich too took an eternity to be delivered and also one of our burgers. So dont expect the Mcd level of fast service and you will be fine. Price: The burgers are not the most reasonable as most are priced around a 100 bucks but size wise too they are more than decent. But all said and done Dunkin does deserve a visit now more than before for some of the amazing new additions to the menu. The likes of Mcd's, Kfc's, and even Subway for that matter should get ready for some tough competition...",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

This was few month back with my then fiance and what a good time i had! The coffee is just amazing and fits the new york style coffee perfectly. Strong and with appropriate froth. i have tasted coffee at various places across the country and abroad , but the coffee here is the best value for money coffee i have had in a long long time. 5 stars just for that! We also had some donuts, the specialty here, i liked them but couldn't enjoy the taste maybe because my coffee overpowered the taste of the donuts! Recently i also tried the cupwhich and the newly introduced burgers over here at the green park joint and fell in love with this place all over again!

This was the first that I went to try out the new menu that Dunkin' has recently introduced. Well, the place, being located in CP, is always full of people from all age groups. The service was really good, with some very interactive servers. The place is all funky from inside, and double- storeyed. I loved everything I ordered, there's no denying it. One must try their cupwiches, which are really moist and almost melt in your mouth. The burgers are really different and great as well, and so are the sandwiches. The dunkachinos are a must have along with the cupwiches! My personal favorite donut is Death by Chocolate! I can have as many as 5 in one go.

Rajat Chauhan,"Rated Opened on the same place where Wimpys existed two years back. The place looks bright, optimistic and smells warm& fresh. I'm not much of a doughnut fan but still respect the place. Went there with my sister after her shopping spree. The menu is diverse and has something for everyone. We picked up a couple of doughnuts, a classic and a choco dunkaccino, and burgers (heaven can wait & a classic). The doughnuts(they all taste the same to me) are not my department. The dunkaccino were great and chilled enough, though the choco one could use more chocolate. The burgers looked ordinary at first sight but smelled good (yes, I smell them before munching), the chicken patties were crisp and the assortments were generously put. Also the breads used were of very good quality, and were spongy unlike what the burger breads taste like at other fast food joints.I cant explain the difference between breads but here's for ref...(the difference between Indian and European chocolates). That is the magnitude of variation! They should really change their name to 'Dunkin Burgers and more'. The counters are busy and usually no one follows the trend of making lines. You can hear heated discussions on the 'greatest doughnut ever' and see kids and some girls drooling over the doughnut counter while you order. Everyone seemed to be chanting 'Death by chocolate'. The waiting time is less and the staff serve you at your table. Overall a great place. Gotta try them Bagels now.",Rated 4.0,15,17,??

Sample the bagels, muffins, and hot and cold-flavoured coffees here. And, of course, the doughnuts - they are perhaps the best in Delhi though they may pale in comparison to their cousins abroad. Death by Chocolate gives you the complete chocolate-y experience. Unlike other cafes, they don't warm the doughnut for you here. Jerk Cottage Cheese Ciabatta Sandwich and Middle Eastern grilled sandwich are simply superb.

A lot of things have changed since then, including my perception. From being just another Cool Coffee & Donut serving place, Dunkins has come a lot way - it especially reflects in their new rechristening - Dunkin Donuts & More (My previous Blog Post on Dunkin Launch ::::::http://gourmetaffairs.blogspot.in/2012/05/dunkin-donuts.html) Today Dunkin has evolved itself into The Coffee Shop for the Gen X, who unlike the older generations, love their Coffee, with some quick eats & quick eats, is what Dunkins has made their forte, so to speak - They offer some of the most amazing Subs & for the fill they provide to starved tummies, they are pretty value for money too - 7-8 Different Sandwiches, for Veg & Non Veg both ---- I find these best suited for Indian Palettes - with the right Masalas, & bite to tickle the taste buds. In offer with the Combos, they are a sure reasonable meal for the young Urban Indian - I have many a times picked up the combos whilst back from a late night office slogging Their Cupwiches are to die for - an interesting take on the ever popular , Cup Cakes - The CupWiches - are soft dough, stuffed with Cheese, Mushroom, Tomatoes, Chicken depending on what you prefer (Veg / Non Veg) - Baking these results in a shot of melted cheese & stuffing in your mouth - Priced at Rs 60/- these are a big hit here The Bagels, being great, should come as no surprise, as being the All American chain, Bagels is the standard stuff, which these guys can dole out even in sleep - The Classic Cream & Cheese Bagel, The Egg & Cheese breakfast Bagel are quite extraordinary - Fresh & soft bread, right flavouring of herbs & grains, leave an interesting concoction of tastes in your mouth In the beverages, while they have the standard fare, Their Dunkachinnos, seem to have been a big hit already - The Latest addition to their ever growing Food repertoire, is the Burgers - The flagship being the ""Heavnens can wait"" Burger or something, which seems to be doing well - Not had the Opportunity to try one - would update once mission accomplished gourmetaffairs.blogspot.com",Rated 5.0,41,246,??

Jigyasa Arora,"Rated after seeing so many advertisements of Dunkin' Donuts everywhere i so wanted to have a bite of the yummy donuts.Since i have a sweet tooth i do like donuts and so i wanted to go to this place. And today i finally did got a chance to taste one. i must say as i entered the place the vibrant colors all around make this place a funky one also the ambiance is good and their is a sweet aroma of the donuts in the restaurant. so i was along with two of my friends and so we decided to take three donuts. one each and along with that we ordered for caramel butterscotch dunkaccino and one strawberry and banana smoothie. well the names of the donuts are itself so amazing( like the one that i ordered was death by chocolate) and and their are sugar glazed ones the simple and plane ones, and this death by sugar one had chocolate on top and was filled with the melted chocolate. they just melt in your mouth and are totally lip smacking and tempting. so if you don't mind consuming some calories i'll suggest you should have one. also their are donut deals which are the saviors. but the dunkaccino was not good yes but smooties are yummy. also we did ask for coolatas which were not available. so a nice choclaty experience of donuts with something to slurp along with that will cost you arount 400 rs. which is awesome. and yes one advice from my side that before ordering the donuts do go through the description of them which is wriiten along with their names as ""looks are deceptive"" what i mean is that do check out what is your donut going to be all about so you get ehat you want.",Rated 4.0,1,0,??

Of special mention are the classic glazed and the triple chocolate. But where they stand out are their sandwiches and bagels. Their breads are the freshest I be tasted in any place in Delhi. Especially the submarines and bagel buns. Their burgers too are well made and filling. But it was the sandwiches that won me over.

Why bother opening an entire restra for donuts. Stalls like M.O.D should have sufficed. Instead what i liked about this place was its ample spacing and its staff not bothering you for ordering or sitting for long hours with your friends. Prices are another plus.

At every festival, they have their special in-house donuts like the stars and nuts during Diwali and Christmas special.

I go here with my friends every fortnight. It's kind of the hot spot for college-going people. I see groups of students preparing presentations over a cup of coffee/Dunkaccino and donuts, women reading books sitting alone with a cuppa and donut, people sitting and chitchatting into the day. The staff is not at all nosy. They let you sit there and chill for as long as you want. The staff is friendly too. They have messed up my drinks so many times, putting kilos of sugar and litres of chocolate syrup but when you tell them you aren't satisfied with your order, they replace it at once!

Niharika.Loves.To.Eat,"Rated I have always compared Dunkin' to Mad Over Donuts not only because both of them sell my favorite desserts of all time but because they are the only two famous franchises in the country that do. No other doughnut making franchises (or even individual sellers) in India have been able to receive laurels from their customers like these two. Dunkin', however, emerges as a winner between these two because it sells a lot more than just the sugary little tyres. It sells food. Of course the doughnuts here are fulfilling. The dough seems fresh because I'm sure they have to make it multiple times a day. They sell so much ! The softness can be felt even after one takes them out from the fridge! They do become hard but within five minutes, the fragrance and essence can be seen and inhaled. They have great variety too. My personal favorites are Death By Chocolate and Rainbow. The former is loaded with chocolate. Inside and outside! And the rainbow one is just beautiful looking. With white cream and colorful sprinkles on top, it looks like a candy. Plus, if you heat it up it can make your mouth water with its fragrance ! Yum. I also like their classic bagels and egg which is soft and melts in the mouth. Their meatball mariana sandwich (which this outlet usually never has) is very filling and tasty. They also make good coffee. I like it way better than I like Starbucks and as much as I Iove Costa Coffee's. Very fragrant and served warm. Especially the Americano. The Forrest Berry Smoothie is also another nice option to try out. Even pineapple milkshake ! As for the ambience and service at this particular outlet, well, the condition is dismal. Too many people and a lot of confusion. My coffee was served to somebody else. I had to wait another twenty minutes for my order. When I protested, no one bothered to look after it. The cashier was busy clearing payments, the rest of the staff just ignored me. They also mixed up my bagels, for which they apologized (thankfully!). Moreover, one doesn't get a chance to sit on weekends because it is overflowing with people just like Starbucks! Whatever is happening in Connaught Place ! Not nice. The pricing is economical. For a bagel, a doughnut and a smoothie it can not cost you more than Rs. 300. Cheers to that! Dunkin' Donuts is a must try. Not too sure about this outlet, though.

There are times when I eat only choclate doughnuts and there are times when I stick to fruit / jelly flavors . Being a fan of MOD in Bangalore , I wanted to try something different in Delhi . And what's better than dunkin doughnuts when I'm in a place like CP in Delhi . While returning from dinner and drinks at a pub in CP , I saw this place and luckily it was open at 11:30 in the night . Thanks to Delhi for that as nothing is open for so late in Bangalore :p . Ambiance : I loved the colorful ambiance with couches , there are two floors .. They serve at ground floor and there is a place to sit down and relax at first floor also . And the display of the doughnuts , oh my my , no body can come back without eating one and as they say , you can't eat just one :) . Doughnuts : they serve a lot of other things , like coffe , shakes . But when I go to a doughnut place I just concentrate on the doughnuts :) . So we ordered a jelly filled doughnut , mango glazed doughnut and the mini sugar coated doughnuts . I loved the taste , they were 'melt in mouth ' soft . The glaze was perfectly sweet and the jelly filled doughnuts was really yummy . Vfm : I didn't pay ( husband did ) , but I guess one doughnut is 49 bucks which is a very reasonable price and their doughnuts are really good . I'm going with a four rating as I couldn't try their other doughnuts being late in the night . But the ones I tried were delicious :) . Highly recommended .",Rated 4.0,265,1731,??
Shambavi Ganju Katoch (What Sam Says About_____?),"Rated Donuts are really my thing, so when I was in CP today , I saw Dunkins and I wondered, well I am a big MOD fan, let me try the Dunkin Donuts as well. I entered the store which was just where the older wengers used to be near outer circle opposite Palika bazaar. Very orange in its look and feel, they serve Donuts, nagels, sandwiches, shakes, coffees and some more beverages. I glanced through the menu and when I was about to order the order taker told me rudely to go on the other counter on the left. I was taken aback by his reaction so I went to the other counter and looked at the line of donuts on the show window and was thinking what to order and I saw the dunkin punchline which said three's company and four is a crowd, so I ordered myself 3 donuts chocolate cart wheel, bavarois cream and death by chocolate donut. so I paid and was waiting for my donuts to be packed and noone was willing to pack the donuts. All guys behind the counter kept staring at one another signalling to each other to pack the donuts. Funny! I thought and I literally had to raise my voice and ask them ""Is anyone going to pack my donuts or should I ask for a refund""; thats when one of the guys wore gloves and hurriedly packed all 3 donuts. Pathetic service I must say, and very ill trained and discourteous staff with a pathetic service attitude. I left dunkin never to return again. I sat in my car and me and my hubby took a bite each of all 3 donuts only to realize that we are better off with MOD'd donuts. They are softer, creamier and so better in taste.

But still I have been to DD more than 5 times now, and never ordered donuts after the first time. :D I just love their sandwiches, nicely priced, they are fresh & very juicy and probably the best thing they have to offer, my favorite being Caribbean Delight & Meatball Marinara. There coffee is pretty average, but they've recently come up with cupwiches which are just awesome! Regarding Donuts, I found MOD better, but again not a Donut fan!",Rated 3.5,314,2014,??

Utkarsh Bhatnagar,Rated I found their donuts better then 'Mad Over Donuts' because the base of their donut is denser then the donuts of 'Mad Over Donuts'.

Chetna,"Rated in Donuts -- v ordered death by chocolate, jelly filled, chocolate frosted and meshy strawberry. all of them tasted great. centre-filled are more yummy. but death by chocolate outdid all so v had to order 2 more of it. ;-) In veg sandwiches, 2 choices only. v tried croissant garden veg sandwich. It was good too. Will try the other one next time. In drinks, Mocha hot coffee n Choco cold coffee. both tasted as they should. n quantity totally matched d price. thumbs up from my side !!

Samiha Verma,"Rated As it is I love CP and now I have even more reasons to. One of my favourite haunts out there. The coffee is simply splendid- Highly recommend Cinnamon Cappucino- nothing like I have ever tasted before. I remember the first time I went to Dunkin Donuts was in August, and I was surprised to see a large range of sandwiches and beverages. I just assumed its everything and only donuts. Soon I saw myself trying out a new sandwich everytime I went there, and obviously carrying a 6 pack or 12 pack of donuts back home has ever since been a regular affair. Dunkin' manages to introduce new things every season and their winter donuts were just superb. In the food range, I am a huge fan of Caribbean Chicken Delight sandwich, and more often than not I am also craving for the bagels which I feel are the best in town. Some of the meal combos are great. My new love is the Hot Chocolate, so I highly recommend that when you are chilling out with your friends or walking towards the metro station.",Rated 5.0,6,104,??

Irfan Mashkoor Khan,"Rated Before catching a long ride in the Metro back to Gurgaon, I stopped over at Dunkin' Donuts to check it out . They have a nice assortment of donuts clearly marked eggless and with egg (strange). Fresh donuts , good coffee based beverages and the coffee too is good but nothing to brag about. Ambiance is also at par with most of the fast food chains. Indianizing the menu is something I don't agree with when it comes to their food. A spicy chicken tikka sandwich is just an excuse to not go there but the donuts are. If anyone goes for the donuts and coffee well its not much of a difference from other countries names of donuts have changed though.",Rated 4.0,31,96,??
Neha Mishra,"Rated Dunkin Donuts just has the right amount of everything that makes your visit an experience in itself. The right amount of sweetness and perfect taste, the right amount of brightness that keeps the atmosphere lively and yes the right amount of damage to your wallet which doesnt leave u bruised..:P On a serious note, Dunkin Donuts is a blessing. I have spent hours and hours here chatting with friends, trying out different Donuts and have totally enjoyed every experience. Death by chocolate and the glazed munchkins are my personal favorites apart from the cheese and chicken munchkin and Dunkin cold coffee. However you can try the bagel and cream cheese if you are looking for something filling. I just cant resist entering Dunkin every time I pass through the lanes (PS: That happens almost every week) and every time I come out with a wonderful experience.",Rated 4.0,127,1075,??
Gurpreet,"Rated I still remember how we used to eat at dunkin donuts in US. Finally it has arrived in Delhi! My favorite one is chocolate donut. I have also tried alphanso milk shake along with Dunkin' cold coffee which I would say are pretty good. 6 donuts for the price of 5 scheme seems to have be copied from MOD. Though it's a good deal. The ambiance of CP outlet is nice. They have good seating space. Due to renovation of CP around this place, you'll have to walk a bit to reach this place after parking your vehicle.

Naina Mittal,"Rated Dunkin Donuts is wow - Coming from someone like me who does not particularly have a sweet tooth that's something. They have a variety of chocolate and non chocolate based donuts that are absolutely heavenly. They have tried to bring in some Indian variation by introducing gulab jamun and motichoor donuts as well, however I have not tried those out. The place is an ideal quick mini meal place with a variety of sandwich options, bagels, tea, coffee etc. The pricing as well is very moderately done and you feel satisfied in more ways than one after having food here. I have only visited the CP and Punjabi Bagh outlets - and one area that they can look into is the general upkeep of the outlets. The outlets have been dirty at times with ignored fallen coffee etc. Parking is also an issue for both the outlets, so be prepared for some tussle in that regard.",Rated 3.0,52,223,??

Otherwise , i tried that jellly filled donut , YUM! it's my favorite so I would've liked it anyway :p Also had the yeast ring donut , it wasnt bad either :) ........................................................ The chicken grilled sandwich tastes exaaaactly like McChicken sandwich ! not even a wee bit difference . I'd rather go for McDonald's in this case . also tried mediterannian mushroom , it was okay-ish , they should basicaly stick to serving donuts though :P The cream cheese bagel was gooooood ! a little too creamy but YUM ! the --COLD COFFEE-- for the first time in ages I had a cold coffee that had milk in it , appropriate amount of milk and it was rich and creamy , loved it ! ......................................................... the ambience was nice , and the service is also good .

Tequila Mockingbird,"Rated I am not much of a sweet tooth but had to simply go here because of the brand that had opened shop in Delhi. Located on your way to the Outer Circle in Connaught Place, Dunkin' Donuts has a lot of vibrancy attached with it. The interiors are very brightly done. The donuts are pretty good. I happened to have two of them over here, and they did not disappoint at all. They also come at a very affordable price. However the other food items that were available here are not that good. Also, the service isn't exceptional here, had to spend quite some time explaining the person on the counter that I wanted my Donuts to be warmed in a microwave. What I would say as on a closing note about this place is that go here for the donuts, available to you at very cheap costs, and sit here and enjoy them with a coffee or two in an ambience that is pretty good. Don't expect the other food items to match the donuts, or exceptional service.",Rated 3.0,105,765,??

Udit Nangia,"Rated My love for donuts pulls me to this place almost every two weeks. Sometimes more than once in a week :D Colorful, spacious interiors. Clearly better than its competitor 'M.O.D.' These guys won't heat your donuts until you tell them to unlike its not so friendly competitor. Friendly and polite staff. The classic donut is pretty good. My favorite is the triple chocolate doughnut. Actually, close my eyes and stuff in any doughnut from this place in my mouth and ill happily chew my way through. Always soft, always awesome! Have never had a better Alphonso Mango Smoothie in my life. Simply heavenly! The forest berry smoothie is a little on the sweet and a little on the sour side. Quite different and nice. Chicken jalapeo in Siabatta is pretty good. Flavorful chunks of chicken with awesome cheese! Middle eastern grilled sandwich is another favorite here. Though this one time, it contained a small stone, which i brought to the attention to the manager (peacefully) and he very politely and professionally got it replaced even though i was done with more than half of the sandwich.",Rated 4.0,39,264,??

Every thing we tried in food section was average except the donuts which were good .. we tried garden veg sandwich which was a copy of subway vegie delite and nowhere in comparison to subway.. but priced equaly ..Rs 80 2. We thought shakes must be good as it had a long menu for shakes and drinks.. but it was horrible.. a shake worth Rs.110 was disaster.. and had only water , cream and li'l milk with no taste..

As per the current digging up in CP, Dunkin Donuts is hard to find if you don't know ur way well in CP, but once you find it, you'll like it if you're tired of ur regular Mad Over Donuts visits. D.D serves much more than ur conventional regular donuts.. though they do not have center filled donuts in their range as of yet (drawback!), but still their donuts are amazing it terms of taste :D the staff is quite polite, hygiene is maintained, ample space to sit, with a nice decor. They don't have a microwave to heat up the donut! most of all D.D serves much more than just ur conventional donuts and tho they r basically a donut shop, their preparations are quite nice :) All in all, a place to visit if ur tired of ur regular M.O.D visits :)",Rated 4.0,199,1071,??

Sunanda Rana,"Rated I like donuts and I cannot lie! Delhi has always been a delight for a foodie like me but every now and then there is another reason to love the city even more than before. I might sound dramatic, but hey I am talking about Donuts! I love donuts - filled with jam, sprinkled with sugar-snow, glazed with chocolates, combination of all :D I have tried almost everything on their menu so I am going to help you decide what to eat when you visit dunkin. Chocolate lovers: hello soulmates! The Chocolate Frosted Donut is yummy! Its soft, the chocolate glaze melts nicely in the mouth. The cake ring donuts are not really as donuty as they are cakey- so if you are in the mood for cake + donut, try their Chocolate Cake Ecstacy. The best thing is Death by chocolate! You must must must try that! Its chocolatety, yummy and gooey, filled in a delicious donut - A chocolate/ sugar rush and bliss guaranteed! If you are not in the mood for chocolate (but why?), the good ol Classic glazed donut, Classic white donut and Strawberry double delight will satisfy your sweet tooth. In case you did not know, Half Dozen or Dozen Donuts are a perfect gift for anyone! :)",Rated 4.0,20,210,??

H@PpY,"Rated Visited Dunkin Donuts in search of good breakfast, quite a big outlet they have with sitting space at Ground Floor and mezzanine floor (can't call it a first floor). You have to place your order at ground floor counter and the food will be delivered at your table. Had ""Egg, Chicken Ham Bagel"", ""Focaccia Bunwich"" along with Caramel Cappuccino. Bunwich was very fresh and tasty but had a bit thick bun. Presentation of Bagel was not good as everything was trying to run out of the bun. But Bagel was also very yummy and quite filling. Cappuccino was okay (Nice to accompany the sandwiches). The price was also quite reasonable looking at the size of our sandwiches as they were quite filling. Visiting Dunkin Donuts and not having donuts means your visit is incomplete. We had a classic glazed donut and triple chocolate donut which were fresh, tasty and FREE. Yes our donuts were free one with each sandwich. I think they have this offer in morning only. To sum up a very nice place to visit if you are in CP in morning to have a fresh and stomach filling breakfast. If you are lucky you might also get free donuts...",Rated 4.0,2,2,??

I went expecting the usual sort of donut shop; but it gives so much more, including a fabulous savory menu other than the donuts, and a nice place to sit and enjoy your meal. The Croissant Garden Veg Sandwich that I ordered was fresh, light and tasted wonderful. That alone was worth the visit. This, along with my Coffee Eclair and Ice Tea cost me just under 200 Rs, making it very affordable. The service is fast and efficient, and the seating arrangement very comfortable.

The ground floor has the counter where you have to self-order, and there is a display full of mouth watering donuts and other chocolaty delicacies which are pleasure to eat as much as they are like therapy for your peepers!! They also have sandwiches, shakes, smoothies and hot/cold beverages on their menu. Apart from the little sweet pleasures, The 'cupwich' an interesting bite sized eat is a must try!

Jason David Byrne,"Rated Set where Wimpy's (Outer Circle of CP) was earlier, the ambience & music is definitely lively with lots of colour thrown in. They have a good variety of sweet Donuts i.e. much more than MOD which are reasonably priced, however, the taste wasn't really something to write home about considering the expectations I had Setting MOD as a benchmark, I found the Donuts to be slightly stale. The bread was slightly on the harder side and cracks were developing in the creamy icing. Donuts are usually served at room temperature or slightly warm which the MOD guys do perfectly without melting the icing, however, here they were cold which probably led to the cracks. The Bagel bread was rubbery and the only saving grace was the delicious sour cream spread. The coffee (Hazelnut Cappucino) and smoothies (Forest Berry) are good. The unexpected surprise was the Chicken and Cheese 'Cupwich'. Quiche shaped and absolutely delectable. But a warning, the contents are extremely hot as I realized the hard way when the piping hot cheese slid down my fingers. A little carelessness while sampling a slice of heaven ;) They should probably put a note on the wrapper which says 'Contents Hot'. A major letdown was the fact that the Attendant did not have a clue about Salted Donuts (refer to the fabled 'Mama Mia' from MOD). All he said was, he'll pass the suggestion on to his Manager. Somethings never change with new joints & new recruits :) Will definitely visit the place again after a few days. Hopefully, alot of feedback will trickle in by then. DD & Jubilant have a lot of work to do if they are to cater to the sweet tooth of the indian public. Especially, when MOD and other smaller (but well known) patisserie's have already made a name for themselves.",Rated 2.0,10,66,??
