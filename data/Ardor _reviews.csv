Siddharth Goyal,"Rated Ardor is an exceptionally beautiful cafe, and is very appealing. There is something weirdly comforting about its interiors, and strangely, the DJ compliments the 'mood.' From what I've heard, they have an extravagant Hookah menu, though that's something that I won't be able to comment on, simply because I don't smoke. Coming to the food, the Dahi Kabab, Veg Pizza and Garlic Bread are something I ordered. The Dahi kebab were an extraordinarily example of finesse, and the beauty of it all with the tangy green chutney was something another level. The Italian was surprisingly well seasoned, and the portions were really good. I was slightly hungry, so taking pictures wasn't exactly on my mind. But if you can take my word for it, do visit!",Rated 5.0,14,58,??

Dr.Vitrag Shah,"Rated Food : 3/5 Ambience : 3.5/5 Music : 3.5/5 Service : 2/5 We went on valentine day @ ardor, for first time. But after this experience, I won't go again and I won't recommend this to others as well, as there are better options @CP with good service too. We were 2 couples , we were provided table which was not comfortable for 4 persons, we requested to change table , first time they told they will do the needful asap. Second time I got reply ""people are waiting , so forget about another table"" and when table in front of us got vacant , we asked again, then also they didn't give us that table and another people came to that table. We entered inside only after they told us that we will get good table for two couples together but they have not made their promise. And I m not just unhappy about that , but there are many more things.. No one was available nearby, we have to look here and there for minutes and call them if we need anything.. Manager had promised me that pizza will be served in our package, but they didn't serve it till last. I bought deal on nearby, 1/2 kg cake was also included in package but they didn't serve us cake too. There was a buffet for.main course and dessert, veg non veg food were together and they did not even labelled any of the items. They were providing 2 snapshots per couple, one snapshot was good. Second one was group pic and quite black, so we told to get individual good pic instead that, and then photographer just went away. I was feeling like why I have booked the deal!! I could have gone to another places like pianoman cafe , Jungle jumboree etc... Anyways, service is important thing and if they could not keep their wods and provide better service, it is not a place which I like. I recommend not to plan ur date or go on any special day or Sunday as u may or may not be ignored. There are other options which provides better good, ambience as well as believe in good service too!!",Rated 2.5,39,20,??
Sujal Pandey,"Rated While it is not too hard to find a big and beautiful lounge in Connaught Place, finding one with great service can sometimes be a task. And that's where Ardor shines. I checked in on Valentine's night which basically means peak of peak hours, if not days. And despite all the crowd, chaos and a million orders from a billion guests, the service was incredible. All of the staff, top to bottom, is extremely helpful and pleasing. Good service is complimented by good food and a good ambience as well. Overall, if you're planning a special evening for two or a fun weekend with friends or family, Ardor is surely one of the better bets in Connaught Place. You cannot go wrong with this place.",Rated 5.0,0,40,??
Chandamita Saikia,"Rated Pathetic. Unprofessional. Below average food. No management. Rude staff. I wish i could give Ardor a Negative rating, like minus 10 on 10. After seeing their beautiful ad in Facebook and Nearbuy app, me and my friends decided to spend quality time on Valentine's Day in Ardor. So as to avoid trouble we went there in Saturday and booked a table for 4 on the terrace especially mentioning which table we want. We paid a token money and mentioned that we will reach around 8.30pm to 9.pm. At the time of booking, the sugar coated Manager said that i m wring the time as 8.30 but he said ""Aap log aaram se aa jaana, u will get the table reserved and ready. Do not worry."" So, on Valentine's day we reached at 9pm delayed by traffic. When we reached there, it was a chaos. We waited in the stairs for 15 mins. The guy at the gate was rude and said we have no seat. When we said him that we have booked it, he was like i will have to see, agar table nahi de sakta toh will refubd the money. Then one lady staff said that there is table in terrace. When we reached there, we met another floor supervisor who said we will have to wait for a table to get empty. When we asked him what was the sense of prior booking and reservation, when they cant keep the table ready. At that time he was blaming us saying that ""the table was booked for 8.30pm. If u cant respect time, how can i respect ur booking"". As if the delhi traffic was in our hand. Finally we got a table for 4, with broken chair and not the one we chose. Our mood was already too spoiled. To worsen it, the food and the mocktail was below average. They served us chilli chicken as starter which was stale and cold. Everytime we call the waiter and tell him that it is cold, please change it. All he changes is the plate with the same food. Our package included one heart shaped 1/2 kg truffle cake per couple. We were 2 couples and so we were suppose to get 2 cakes. They gave us 1 cake and I that too the heart was incomplete. When we asked, that we were suppose to have 2 cakes, they said that it will be 1 cake for 1 group, forget couple. Management is pathetic. Few staff to handle the over bookings they took out of greed for money. My entire evening, the time and the money all wasted. I would never ecer visit it again and will make sure to spread enough bad word of mouth for them.",Rated 1.0,2,17,??
Aman Deep Singh,"Rated I went there with my friends, booked table prior one day. Once i reached, Manager don't know the meaning of time frame . If you book a table and given any time frame then according to him its not correct, if u r too unlucky to get a table then take food which will test your patience. Mocktails are pathetic, starter are not properly cooked and served. Only mutton is good which u won't taste after watching all this. Asking for anything u feel like dhaba is better. After getting disgusted due to all these unprofessional behaviour u will get a cake which is not a full cake. I won't let any friend to visit there.",Rated 1.0,0,16,??

Shweta Aggarwal,"Rated As I and my friends were wandering in CP and were searching on Zomato for a new place to enjoy some nice food, Ardor seemed to be a good option in its photographs. Famous for its romantic ambiance, spanned across two floors, Ardor offers crafted Romantic Packages, High-Tea Menu, Hookah Menu, Lunch Menu, etc. for the customers and conducts happy hours all day long. Ardor has a simple interior with blue color lighting and minimum artifacts. We started with a variety of soups and starters. Clear Soup was the one I chose but little disheartened as it was bland with no fragrance of black pepper. Manchow Soup and Hot n Sour Soup were warm and flavorful. In starters, we had Tomato Bruschetta, tangy but little sweet. Stuffed Mushroom Caps were crispy from outside and delicate from inside. Kache Kele aur Rajma ki Tikki were soft and full of spices, Tandoori Flower was the best, simple yet elegant, Dahi ke Kebab were smooth and tasted well with green chutney. Vegetable Salt n Pepper was crispy and comforting. In mains, we tried North Indian only, Kumbh Makai Hara Pyaaz was yummy, Subz Miloni was okay, Daal Ardor was the delectable one with richness in every spoon and all these curries went well with Missi Roti. Subs Dum Biryani was served in a handi with raita. In desserts, we had Hot Gulab Jamun, the perfect way to end a meal. Overall Ardor is a nice place to relish quality time with family and friends. The background music is Instrumental Bollywood and after 8:30 PM, they have live Gazals session played by Sameer Khan, which makes the place more lovable. Ardor has a loyal clientele due to Mr. Suveeth Kalra, who surely knows how to attend the customers personally. thefoodiefling.blogspot.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Divya Gopakumar,"Rated Went for my birthday party!! The experience was far from wow, but then since we could dance to death- I am giving them an abv average review.

Daal ardor was there chef special (it takes 2 days for preparation) and really it was amazing in taste. Tandoori flower was also a unique dish, first time I had in Ardor.

Manish Jaggi,"Rated Went thereby fluke, First of all, my brother and i got the corner table at the roof which was already dirty. we could actually see the guy making hookaah for every one and he was himself smoking it with another guy (other guy was just standing there for no reason). the staff was confused, i asked them to change the table because it was dirty, they did but after 5 min. they asked us to move back. THE WORST PART WAS THAT ONE TABLE MIGHT HAVE ASKED FOR ANOTHER GLASS, RATHER THAN GETTING A NEW GLASS THE STAFF USED THE OLD GLASS AND DIPPED IT INTO DIRTY WATER AND TOOK IT BACK TO THE TABE. Maybe this is the dark side of these cafes. on the beer the lable said 70rs but they sold it for 280. dont know how much profit they want to make in shot term, coz i know this kind of service and unhyginicness is the worst place one can go to. AND, if you order a hookaah, they will not put it in the bill, it's price will be written by a pen itself. and they chage 1000/- for it and honestly it was bad as hell.

Ashish Yadav,"Rated I can even rate them more than five if possible. It was my anniversary day and for two long days we got bugged up juggling almost all romantic listed restaurants in Delhi and finally we saw ""Ardor"" cp and thought of booking a package for the evening. We booked the package that included : 1. Unlimited food and beverages that too of our choice from the menu all open 2. Full decoration for a perfect romantic candle light dinner 3. A mandolin player to make it more perfect evening 4. A complimentary bouquet and a delicious cake 5. All this in the price of a normal dinner we usually have in any other restaurants. All that looks perfect was supported by a overwhelming service and responsive staff to mention specially there in charge manager Mr Bisht who was all available during our stay at this place he not only escorted us to the table but even went us to drop to the car and taking care of each and every event in the middle.

Vishal Arora,"Rated Hi To be frank it was my 3rd experience at Ardor and trust me it was the best out of all 3 put together. I had planned dinner party for my family and close friends on the occasion of my wife 1st birthday after our marriage. So this has to be special any which ways. At the face of it i was a little confused whether to book the lounge or the 1st Floor where they had made the arrangements for Ghazal night. Thank god i was guided well by Mr.Bisht who suggested me to enjoy our meals on the 1st floor since we had both families and friends together. He also gave us the option of shifting in case we find it a little bore or monotonous. But Trust me we didn't even got the chance to even go upstairs to check out what's happening there..We were so captivated by two people who were entertaining us with their beautiful voice. We also requested many songs from them which they very beautifully sung as well. I would say in all it was an awesome experience for my family as well as they were listening to Ghazals after a really really long time.. As far as the hospitality is concerned, it was really good. The service was average but you can expect it being sunday night..everybody expects 100% upto the mark service. My suggestion is have 2-3 attendants per table(Gathering between 10-15 pax) Having said that still we guys really enjoyed a lot and would love to visit Ardor again.

Raghav,"Rated We went there with nearbuy coupons which turned out quite economical as we saw a la carte rates which is soaring high for the place. I felt that this place is being neglected by the management as it wasn't upto the caliber it can attain. The ventilation was off , there were mosquitos inside , the music was off at 4 oclock etc were the things that turned us off. The servers need grooming in respect of know how as they weren't aware of the deal they have posted and that what is the quantity they serve of different items. Now coming to the food starters were just okay but the veg lasagna was so good and drinks were good too. They apparently serves the best brownie. I loved it. But the only negative is that other items we ordered both in starters and the mains had similar taste. They should improve that. So a 3 for this place that too just because of lasagna brownie and drinks.",Rated 3.0,11,97,??

Sonal Mahendru,"Rated While Ardor was bookmarked in my to-be-visited list since long, I kept it for a special occasion and thank god I did! Ardor has customised options as per your likings. You can get the table decorated, or your pickups arranged in impressive cars and so much more. Feel free to have a little convo with the management before deciding and you never know this might turn out to be the place you create a memory with your special ones. Ardor is mainly sub-divided in four sections which includes a fine dine sitting area, party halls, balcony view and the one with dance floor. Overall, Ardor has something to offer for everyone. As we entered the place, we planned on starting with a hookah and drinks first, which is why we got seated upstairs. The deck wasn't the biggest in CP, but quite comfy and warm with a spectacular view. The staff is courteous and been decently trained. We ordered for red wine SANGRIA - my staple and ardor JackDaniels along with a commisioner flavor hookah. My sangria was heavenly! Perfect to the T!! Must try for wine lovers! The music alone was good enough to jazz up our mood! Swinging cheerfully to the music and savoring my wine, we ordered for more drinks including WHISKEY SOUR and SHIRLEY TEMPLE. & since then, this is what I have been saying to my friends: ""Agar Ardor jake bhi Whiskey Sour try nahi kia toh kiya kya?"" HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Goes straight to my favorite list. Once done with the drinks, we proceeded for the dinning area and was amused to see a mandrin player specially playing on our table. Our table was warmly lit by a candle and had rose petals for decoration. Probing the servers, we settled for nothing less than a scrumptious meal! We ordered: Gazab ka seena Murgh tikka punjab Grilled fish Prawn salt and pepper Dal Ardor Khumb makai hara pyaaz Cheese Naan Pulao Except the grilled fish, to say I savoured every bit of our meal - would still be an understatement! LOVED Murgh tikka punjab! Must Try! The cheese naan was soft and went well with dal and khumb dish, which gave exciting flavors to my palate. The best part is that none of the dishes are too spicy or too oily but delivers an extreme satisfaction, unlike most places. We ended our meal with soft dollops of gulab jamun and walnut brownie. And, right before leaving a happy team member tempted us to try Ardor Special Kulfi. Even after we were all stuffed up, we gave in the temptation and tried the kulfi which was an in-house preparation and TOO GOOD! Again, Highly Recommended!! To conclude, all I can say is - Ardor has been a pleasant memory.

Eat Style Shop,"Rated For my birthday, I went to this restaurant with a few of my friends. It was in the day, so not many people were there and we had almost a whole section to ourselves. The drawback of going in the day here is that there is no good music and not even many people who are dinning here. However, the food made up for everything. The service was fast and the food was quite good. What to ate: We ordered a whole lot of things here starting with Lotus Stem(with honey and chilli) along with spring rolls, vegetable pizza and vegetable dumplings. The dumplings were a little dry and not something I would recommend. Moving ahead we ordered some Mughlai lunch Paneer Lababdar, Dal Ardor and biryani. The paneer was quite spicy but finger-licking good. I would also give thumbs up to dal and biryani. What we drank: Honestly, I have no count of what we drank but I would like to mention about their Oreo mint drink. It is a must have here! What we paid: Again, Im not very sure as I lost the bill but it was close to 6k which is decent enough for 7 people. Ps: We didnt try the hookahs here but if you have, do let me know how they are.

I love the way this restaurant holds three different auras, it has a fine dine area on the first floor where marvelous Ghazal performance is bound to mesmerize you and on the second floor they have lounge area along with an open terrace seating as well. My experience during both the visits were fabulous because of the delectable delicacies they serve, I tried a lot of things but still there are lot more to explore. Dishes which are must try are Jack Daniel Chicken Sizzler, Tawa fish, Chicken salt n pepper, veg salt and pepper, prawn salt and pepper in starters. In mains I would like to suggest to definitely try their Ardor special dal, butter Chicken, Nasi Goreng, Red prawn Thai curry. They all were simply scrumptious. In desserts, never to be missed is their in house made matka kulfi which is sinful and a must must try. Highly recommended in fact. Apart from the sumptuous food their staff and service is very effective and efficient too. The owner himself is so humble that he makes sure to take the feedback of his guests personally for the improvement which is very appealing I must say.

For starters we had Achari Mushrooms, Prawns salt and pepper and Jack Daniel's chicken (Sizzler). Fabulous in presentation and super delicious in taste. All three are highly recommended and are a must have here. For mains we had Daal Ardor, Butter chicken and Tawa fish along with Garlic naan. Both the main course dishes were also good.

Christina Peter,"Rated I must have crossed this place like a million times but it was never on my wishlist per say. However when I got to know they have love Ghazal nights, it was decided that a Saturday evening would be spent here. It's decided into two sections- Fine Dine and Lounge. Drinks: Whiskey sour- Ardor knows it's cocktails and how. One of the best Whiskey sour ice had in a long time. Perfect to the T! Old Fashioned- Another proud moment for Ardor. The aromatic drink looked and tasted divine. Watermelon Mojito- This is gradually becoming my fav drink and Ardor strengthened the bond. Starters: Prawns- Juicy, succulent, delicious prawns coated in a spicy mix of spring onions, chillies and spices. Delicious! JD Chicken- Now that's the highlight of the evening. From the presentation to the taste, everything was top notch. The chicken was juicy and we'll cooked while the veggies on the side gave the perfect crunch required. A must have. Pizza- Thin crust, not too cheesy and topped with generous helping of chicken. Perfect to munch with the drinks. Mains: Dal- I've been a Bukhara regular for donkey years and Ardor dal reminded me of Bukhara somewhat. That's as big as a compliment it gets! Veggies in Black bean sauce- Thick gravy, crunchy veggies and that heat quotient. It's lipsmackingly good. Desserts: Brownie with ice cream- Walnut brownie that wasn't too sweet yet enough to satiate that dessert craving topped with Vanilla ice cream.. classic and delicious! They've nailed the food, the Ghazal singer is definitely a five star addition to your evening, the service is impeccable. Staff is attentive, polite and courteous. Wish they'd work on their presentation a bit and it's an upward journey all the way! Well done Ardor and thanks for doling out that gorgeous food!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Natalia Anthony,"Rated Aptly located in the heart of CP outer circle easy to find you cannot afford to miss Ardor with its well lit sign board. Opposite to KFC and right next to McDonald's. The place is recently refurbished and is beautifully branched into two floors. The first floor is a tranquil lit with blue pleasing lights. The decor is eloquent and comfortable for a romantic meal with your other half or an all adult dinner. Since, the first floor is designed in exquisitely it is where Sufi songs are played back to back or on request. The ambiance gets so relaxed and intense at the same time. Soul touching Sufi songs and heart warming food, one can never go wrong with that. Drinks: Moscow Mule: It was refreshing and just how I would like to get started with my drinks. Cosmopolitan: I make sure I try cosmopolitan where I dine. Presentation was very generic but it tasted fruity and went down well. Snacks: Jack Daniels Chicken: Chicken with seasonal viggies. Chicken was so tender and juicy. The mushroom sauce on top was creams and gorgeous. Salt N Pepper Prawns: Crispy prawns, well presented taste could have been better. Second floor is the exact contrast of first floor. It was lively, loud music, ambiance is energetic. That's the lounge where you are served Hookha. Hookha: It was smooth, flavorful and flowing. There are very few places that serve good hookha and since you are looking for one then don't look any further. Ardor is the place to come. Dinner: Thai curry: I cannot get enough of that delicious Thai green curry. It was creamy and spicy went down so well with rice. It was absolutely gorgeous. Must try at Ardor. Mexican Chicken pizza and Chicken: Base was neither thick or too thin just how it should be. The toppings were crunchy veggies and spicy chicken. Dal Makhni and Garlic Naan: Thick hot dal with warm garlic naan with simple onion salad was a relish. I'm a huge fan of there Dal Makhni. Well done. Garlic noodles and schezwan sauce: It was like any other noodles schezwan sauce I've tried nothing special.

AnKit Sharma,"Rated Ardor is a restro bar located in the outer circle of CP. Though Ardor is very old but it got renovated few months back and now ambience is very much impressive. This place is divided into two floors first floor is a fine dine with live Ghazal sessions every night they even ask for your song suggestion while top floor is for party animals to dance on the beats of DJ. On my visit first I sat on the terrace area of top floor to enjoy Hookah and Starters. Their hookah is really good I tried the kiwi flavor and smoke was perfect. Generally you get Booz and hookah in CP but only few places serve good food and Ardor is one of them. For starters I had Jack Daniels Chicken, Salt N Pepper Prawns and Chilli Chicken. Jack Daniels Chicken was properly cooked lip smacking grilled chicken made in Jack Daniel sauce and served with veggies. It's quite different and a must try. Salt N Pepper Prawns served with Pappad and chilli sauce was so juicy and delicious and my favorite from the menu. Again a must try. Chilli Chicken was also very good. Perfectly marinated and it was mildly hot , sweet and sour. Along with the starters I had Whisky Sour and oh man they make amazing whisky sour basically it's a concoction of whisky , lime juice and lil bit egg white and they made it perfectly. You can't miss having Whisky Sour if you're visiting this place. I also tried White Sangria and Virgin Pina Colada both were also good. By the time of main course it was already 8:30pm and that's the time when they start Ghazals on first floor so we decided to move down to enjoy our main course with the heart touching songs and their artists are really good. Coming back to the food for the main course I had Mexican Chicken pizza and Chicken Thai curry. Pizza was fresh, soft and topped with jalapeos, capsicums & onion. Just had only one piece of it coz my concentration was on Thai curry served with steamed rice and that was so delicious. Finally we finished our meal with Brownie and Vanilla ice cream. Nice place with good food and music I'd love to visit again.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Anirudh Jain,"Rated Went for a friend's birthday party yesterday! Had been there 2 years back also. The place now seems overshadowed by the new and much hyped lounges and bars in the Connaught Place. Food was great which i really appreciate. Usually the food quality is degraded when people choose other options to visit rather than than the place itself, but this place has maintained its mark. The party was on second floor in a private area, the interior seemed bit old and according to me needed some renovations to look top notch. Overall the experience was good both the times and staff was also courteous. This is a place which i think has it's name maintained in terms of service and food even after new places coming up in the CP area.Khyati Hans",Rated 4.0,42,40,??
Sidhant Ahuja,"Rated Ardor is a restaurant cum lounge located at one of the best places of Connaught Place. It occupies two floors,first and the second. The first floor has live sufi ghazals playing all week except Tuesday's. The live music will simply touch your soul. It seeps into and remains there for a long time. One can also dedicate songs to one another. This floor is basically to enjoy your food,listen to music, have a talk with friends. While the second floor is the complete opposite of the first one. The place has an aromatic ambience with dim lighting and an outdoor terrace. Coming down to the drinks tried the White Whine Sangria and Whisky Sour under the signature Cocktails and Pina Colada under the normal section. Whisky sour will definitely kill your whisky cravings. Even the White Wine Sangria was pretty good. Pina Colada was a perfect concoction of white rum,pineapple juice and coconut cream. For starters we tried the Chili Chicken,Prawns Salt N Pepper and Jack Daniels Chicken. Prawns Salt N Pepper was the highlight of the menu. Perfectly made prawns wrapped in a pappad served with sweet chili sauce was absolutely delicious in taste. Jack Daniels Chicken is perhaps a new dish I tried. Soft and juicy chicken breast grilled perfectly served with sauted vegetables and mushroom sauce was scrumptious in taste. Very juicy and tender chicken. Highly recommended for steak lovers. Moving on to the main course tried the Mexican Chicken pizza and Green thai with steamed rice. The pizza had a very soft base topped with cajun chicken,mushroom,capsicum,onions and jalapeo. The thai curry was creamy and had an amazing flavour to it. It was fresh , fragrant and had a vibrant green colour. Tasted amazing with steamed rice. In desserts tried the Chocolate Brownie with Ice cream. The brownie which was soft and gooey was of a big size topped with chocolate sauce and the Ice Cream was served separately was luscious in taste. Overall this place has everything the first floor can be accommodated for family luncheons while the second floor with the terrace is perfect for parties.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Some very boring, depressing music was being played in the background and the staff too was inefficient and slow, despite the fact that the place was hardly crowded. Among mocktails, bellini and virgin margarita were nice.

Once they serve the sheehsa it's hard to find them again to serve you. I went here mostly in the evening or the afternoon and the place is dull. Coming to the prices they are highly expensive respecting the fact that sheehsa quality is ok and the service is not good.

I was searching for restaurants and shortlisted this today. From the moment I entered the restaurant to till the time we left, the staff made sure that we had no problems whatsoever. Excellent staff! Made our evening all the more special. There are two levels of seating, the lounge area and the restaurant. We opted for the latter. We ordered the ferrero roche shake. This was a decent beverage to go with the food. We had the chilly garlic noodles which were ordinary. The taste wasn't anything exciting. Another drawback was the quantity. It was less for two people. A miss for me! The STAR dish for Me was the Mexican Pizza. The combination of toppings along with the seasoning made every bite worth it. Big enough to be shared by two people. I regret not going here before and I recommend it to everyone for a quiet meal !",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

First of all if you have an other option to go elsewhere, choose that over this restaurant . They have a lounge, a bar and a family restaurant, I had been to the family restaurant... Firstly the place was very very noisy. The din won't allow you to converse with the fellow members so for a family dinner it's out of question. Secondly the live music and singer are good but because of being a small place the music becomes noise... The ambience is not good, some old fashioned chandeliers are hung from the ceilings giving it the look of a dungeon... The only good thing was that the food was of average type else it would had been a total disaster...service is pathetic.. Washroom is very small and is common for ladies and gents...

It was a live ghazal night and the musician duo was pretty good. That's where the good part ends! So the food was bad. Two out of the three people, who ate there, fell sick due to the food. The third one hardly ate. One had food poisoning and puked the guts out right from the night itself till the next day. While the other person had such severe mouth infection that he hasn't been able to eat since 4 days and doctor says he won't be able to eat for 2-3 more days. Doctor says it's much thanks to bad quality Chinese food, and of course there was no way that he knew that we had some bad honey chilly potatoes that night. Adding to the woes, we were served the wrong dish. We had ordered the European Platter, while we were served a random platter which consisted of small quantity of pita and hummus and few cutlets, which was really bad. When asked the waiter looked clueless as to how they served us that and rushed back in few moments saying that they didn't have European platter so they served us with that. Decided what we would like to eat on their own? Like really? And of course they weren't going to bring it to our notice that the highest order of platter was being replaced by such randomness, and might have charged us that way as well. They had no beer except hoegaarden and corona. LIIT was ordered before the beer and it tasted like cheap alcohol. The two Virgin Margaritas were fine though.

We had a team party around 25 people luckily we all didn't reach at the same time , that was the good part as their service was very slow sometime you order for a drink they really forget about it and you have to chase them for your order and staff is not at all helpful and friendly.1) Place is quite compact with not much support from staff.2) Staff is more bust in fighting with no hospitality expericnce for their guests.3) For us it was so miss management that we have to pass the stuff and manage ourself only.4) DJ would have its own wish when to play and was arrogant.5) They got the over priced bill of 13k which they accepted once we pointed that out.I would not like to reccommend it any one .

You get to see two different words - a fine dining restaurant and a loud lounge but both seprate form each other so there is no interferrance and as a guest you can enjoy both. We went with family (15 people) while my uncles and mom/dad were enjoying Satyana Ghazals from Sameer Khan, we cousin took some time out to jig a leg or two in the lounge upstairs.

Deepak Maini,Rated We went to this place to celebrate b'day party but their quality of food is very poor. We really shocked after we found live running WORM in the plate. It was really shocking for all of us and manager was pleading that time and ask to refund the money instead of talking about the quality parameters. This is really disgusting and you guys will be surprised to know that Manager clearly told me that we don't afraid from food inspector as they all take money. Only thing worry us is the rating which comes on the ZOMATO or any social networking sites.

Bhav Jha,Rated I had a great office party at this place. We had a package deal for 20 people which was totally worth it. I think ardor is one of those lounges where your better off in a large group. A couple of mates might not have such a great time at this place. The interiors are average and they got a small dance floor aswell. What I loved was their Balcony cum terrace. Really cool place to spend some time with friends in the open. Grab a smoke or a beer to go with... Im not much of a shutterbug person but terrace is d place where you gotta click ur selfies...

The only bad part was that they ddint serve ed us hot water to wash hands and the waietr who took our bill which was 35 rupees more than our voucher never turned up for returning the change As if like he took his tip by himself. thats seemed a bit awkward.. go for beautiful soul touching music their...,Rated 3.5,1,10,??

Nirvana exemplified",Rated 4.5,10,9,??
Lohit Chauhan,"Rated Been there twice, first one was with elderly ppl so couldn't exploit the place much. Went again with a bunch of friends, we were about 17 or 18. It was a farewell party for one of our colleague. Story cut short. Food: okayish. They have a good collection of both veg and non veg items. Their chilly garlic prawns were my personal favourite. Service: snails are faster I guess. They were seriously very slow in bringing the starters. It was the same on the 3rd and the 4th round. Bar is good have a good collection. But seriously not satisfied with the service. We had pre-booked the food menus and at last when there was the time for sweets, I went along with 2-3 ppl for paying the bill, when returned the sweets (ice cream) had finished asked the person serving us to bring a few more, they denied saying you were 18 we have already served for 18 people.(rude isn't it..??) Ambience: good, the place is well compartmentalised. There are 3 areas. 1) The terrace: its as smoking zone, I say for smokers cuz one can't sit there with friends as its too hot for delhi summers (coolers don't work). 2) The dance floor: Ample area for abt 20 ppl. DJ was good to us, played mixed numbers, was a bit slow in playing the requested numbers (won't blame him for that). Overall a fine experience. 3) The regular sitting zone: its on the first floor ( the other two are on the second floor, you have to walk in there no elevators). It's good for the regular family dinner, on my first visit sat there only. They were having a nice sufi night that day, sang songs on request the old bolly numbers only. This one is for the family dinner and peace time. Overall a nice place for family dinner, won't recommend for large gathering.",Rated 2.5,11,30,??

Mallika Ghosh,"Rated The place is very unprofessionally run and you can expect pathetic service coupled with below average food. The place does not deserve to quote the rates which the menu quotes. We were a group of 8 people and had made a reservation with a person named Rakesh. When we entered the restaurant, the manager & host refused to believe the reservation & acknowledge the person who had taken the reservation. It being a Saturday night, we somehow managed to get a table. Service initially was not bad, however, on e the outlet had other bigger groups arriving, we were clearly sidelined, the funniest part being the manager kept asking us to wait for 5 mins every time we wanted to place an order. Clearly we were nowhere in their list of priorities. We had ordered mozzarella cheese sticks, fish fingers, chicken satay, chilli chicken, asparagus with water chestnuts and truffle mushroom in garlic sauce (pls read no traces of water chestnuts and gravy being very salty with no hints of any garlic). Overall the food can be safely rated below average to about average and service being way below average , almost poor. Rakesh (person taking the reservation) ended up making up for the pathetic service, don't blame him since he try his best purely at an individual level, seemed like a new joinee. Hope the unprofessional attitude of the place does not rub on him anytime soon :) here's my final verdict- please avoid this place and if you end up dining here, do it purely at your own risk.",Rated 1.0,33,337,??

We took a preset menu.... I'll start with the service and would say initially they started with pathetic service very slow and not able to manage types but gradually they did well... There was one particular staff who was doin good and thus got managed... The food is okay... We had ordered a variety however the best I would say was the dal makhani and gulab jamun !!!!

SSanjana,"Rated A much awaited trip that finally happened. Ardor is located at the outer circle and has a space of two floors, one for fine-dining and a lounge on upper floor. We went for fine dining as I don't drink or smoke. The decor is all in tasteful and soothing shades of blue. From chairs to chandeliers, every single article has an antic and soothing look. Also in summers these cool hues are quite a relief. Starting from food, we ordered lassi, kadhai paneer and tandoori roti. The menu is not that detailed and has basically Indian and Thai cuisine. Lassi was not cold as one would expect. Kadhai paneer was average with lesser gravy. Tandoori roti was good. Taste was average but service was really good. Waiters are attentive and take care that guess are properly served. Some people might find it a little nosy but I prefer being waited on promptly. At the end we asked for bill. Again the one thing I hated was not being offered hot water to wash hands which is wrong specially when one has had indian cuisine. They did however offer towels soaked in hot water to clean hands when we brought it to their notice that this is a necessary service. This is the only complaint I have. All in all it's a good restaurant and I might visit again.",Rated 4.5,35,228,??

Ria Oberoi,"Rated I went there at Saturday night. The food and ambiance was okay. I could have given a better rating but I am giving such poor rating only because of the DJ. I have never seen such a stubborn and impolite DJ. He only played good songs until 10 PM. After that, the only music we could hear was beats. Imagine- No song at all!!

There wasn't any DJ in the house and he didn't come in until 9:30 when half the crowd had gone back. Talking about the good, the pizza was disappointing and so were the mutton kababs.

Cant relly deny or justify my adjudgement myself but every rating here is somehow dilemmatic. It was easy to access and explore this venue and the entrance is pretty gud at 1st sight... The restaurant section is located on 1st floor so my first step in and the staff shall come rushing to you for your convenience...also the concierge is right in front of the opening door. Further I got pretty amused and convinced that all the pic shown in the zomato promotion are clickd and promulgated in night view with respect to which I summed up that this place is only good to go for dinner or eve meal coz they dont operate light in a particular section where we sat and it was a diminutively dark which is not at all appreciative and then the place is big undoubtedly but lunch time better ask them for a seating arrangement in light section..... Later on thr staff amicability was something I adored a lot but the quickness is partially questionable.... Then came the final round I ordered for cheque but due to some miscommunication and duelness there was some mistake which was later compensated for.... Hence, a satisfied meal with a smile. Loved it...:-)) :-)) :-)) :-)) :-))",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

It appeared as if they hav made desperate attempt to get extra covers by putting sofas in every corner they could find. Plus some areas are overlit while the others are dark as dungeon. Also, the cushions arent comfortable. I chose the outdoor seating as the weather was pleasant.. Mayb it wasnt a good day for i was soon humbled to the floor as i sat on d chair which a broken leg.

Vandita_Roaming Gastronaut,"Rated Ardor is one place that used to be the star hangout of CP until few years, before the new cafes and pubs began to mushroom. But sadly, like most places, Ardor seems to have made peace with losing its sheen to the new players. It has lost the enthusiasm and fervor that was synonymous to its name. I visited this place couple of weeks back when I was supposed to meet a friend in CP. The last time I had been to Ardor was few years back, so I suddenly felt like taking a look at how the place is doing now after all these years. We all had a great time there at our last get-together. Since the evenings were still cool, it being February. We decided to take a seat on the terrace. Also, we had some catching up to do so we didnt want loud music to drown our words. That tiny fountain in the centre against the backdrop of Buddhas face, is still the masterpiece. After going through the menu, we ordered Veg Mezze platter, jhinga dum nisha, vegetarian pizza with bell peppers, baby corn and olives topping. The mezze platter was the best part of the meal. Pita bread was served with falafel, hummus, tzatziki and baba ghanoush dips and salad. The dips were delicious but I wish the pita was served warm. I love it that way! The jhinga dum nisha were tandoori tiger prawns. They were spicy and flavorful but the portion size was small. Coming to the pizza, although the toppings were very generously served, the dough wasnt soft and was dry. Overall the pizza tasted rather bland and we had to resort to use the seasoning to spice it up. roaminggastronaut.wordpress.com",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Turning point was when the food was served 20 minutes after giving the order.

Rahul Batra,"Rated Disappointment is the word... Hearing a lot about this place, I suggested Ardor to one of my friend when we decided to meet in CP. We reached well in time around 8. Commendable job of splitting the sections, a well lit dining area and dark bar area. A good thought to involve families as well as party goers. But management people, one question why you dont have more than half of the menu items available with you. Still I take it for granted that you people dont have and really nice stickers which you people have pasted on the menu in order to hide the unavailable items. But if some guest still look out for available item and orders, then how come it becomes unavailable. May be I would have landed on a very bad day... But trust me, the only thing I could eat at your restaurant is ""disappointment""... For the staff, very cooperative in changing the seats but uncooperative when it came to ordering. The response comes "" only the kitchen knows what is available"" so I think you should have your chef roaming around the tables. Ambiance yes it is good as I mentioned earlier as well ..

Ronak Singh Ahuja,"Rated Before writing the detailed review I would like to say a BIG NO to this place. I went there with four of my male and female friends on the Christmas Eve. I had a perception that this place is good and have a good gentry of crowd but after visiting this place it all literally shattered. Let me tell you why. 1) We booked a table for five people and what we a got is a table for four that too congested and a chair on the other side of the table w/o any leg room whereas a complete section of this place was closed with Sofas. 2) When we looked around there was only a group of 5-6 girls and all other were just guys and stags. Now, that's really not a big issue if you are with a group but the gentry was not at all good. I was feeling like I am sitting in some hookah lounge of East Delhi or Ghaziabad. 3) We ordered Veg and Non veg Platters and people, I have tasted better food. The food and its quality and quantity was not upto the mark. I would really say that the chef was either tired or was not a chef because he cooked damn bad as he was in a hurry and just served the food for his salary. 4) The DJ was playing songs which was meant for drunk guys. He was also trying to mix summer of '69 with some beats and I don't know what he was doing. Either I DO NOT have sense of music or the DJ was incapable of mixing that time. But my friend if you read this, Please do not mix a legendary song like summer of '69 with fast Punjabi beats. Secondly he was asked to announce the food for the guests. I still remember the exact words ""Mr. Rakesh aapka dinner lag chuka hai, aap ja ke kha sakte hain"" . Team Ardor please do not make these announcements through DJ. 5) The toilets were not at all clean and were stinking. Also, I saw some guys there using ladies washroom. At this moment I thought of leaving this place but I was not sure if I will get a table anywhere else at that time being Christmas eve. I really was not feeling comfortable because of the environment there. Finally it was our time to leave and we asked for the bill. The bill was a shocking around 13-15k and I was like LOL. I do not know if it was only that day or it happens every now and then like this there but for me this place is a ""BIG NO GO!""",Rated 2.0,122,1221,??

Dhwani Shah,"Rated It was a nice wednesday evening and we chose to have an outdoor seating for a friend's birthday party. AMBIENCE:2/5 for outdoor seating;the table was not clean neither the surroundings which was a big turn off for me ...i dun like mess around my food table. however, the table was cleaned after we reached there and we got to seat after 6 to 7 minutes after arrival. .the table was not well set keeping in mind a gathering of almost 10 people and we hardly got a chance to interact as many of us were chit chatting from one corner to other unnecessarily disturbing our other friend's conversation. FOOD: 3/5 Well i only speak for the vegetarians...we ordered a pasta in creamy sauce and a veg platter for starters...and they were good enough for our taste buds. ..and moderately priced..but i craved for the starter quantity ..they were just JUST enough for two people but tasted really gud :) DRINKS: 2/5 with inputs from my alcohol buddies and non alcoholic ones...they need to improve here.. Overall the bill was almost 14k for 10 ppl including taxes alcohol ..lil high i presume for what we ordered...The indoor seating was ok'ish as well..not as pretty as in these pictures..but never mind..I recommend a visit once...prbly a second for me in case i run out of places to hangout in cp ;)",Rated 3.0,7,38,??

Finally we sat in the Open space...while i have to say the view was awesome but there was some private party going on therefore we had to wait for someone again to take our order. We Ordered for a Juice, Miss Mojito and the Margarita Pizza . It came quite late and then suddenly they stopped music ....what kind of lounge stops the music being played. Last but not the least ...I didn't liked the Margarita pizza ....i.e. it was plain thin crust and tomato puree over it...which no added flavours ...Felt like that i am coming directly from a hospital and doctor has advised me not to have anything except the tomato. However, on a bit of perusal their Chef came and promised to revamp and do a better job this time... and while he did added spices to it...however i surely had better pizzas . I would say ..nice location however they should improve their menu i.e. only 3 types of pizzas ..Come on guys you can do a better job in this category.

Couldn't order a beer beacause only stella and bud were available costing 400 for a pint. Anyways alcohol was expensive as it should be ,sharing the sentiments of indian govt., but,discord in price and quantity of dishes was astounding. We ordered around 10 dishes.Most of the dishes we ordered are not in the menu above ,but ranging from 400 to 500, they were not even worth half of it. As per taste, dishes were not bad,but neither were they something extraordinary. The reason to go there had alaways been to dance; so,we got on the floor at around 10 . DJ and his choices were definitely good but at 11 he stopped the music saying that he had to take dinner. It was perfectly alright for him to do so, only that he never returned while we waited for quarter to an hour. At last having paid more than 10000, all of us were left hungry for more and the balming effect alcohol was supposed to have, vapourised in thin air,leaving us annoyed and agitated.Back to our places almost all of us ordered or had something to get a sleep.

Talking about the Staff- the staff is courteous, though the service is too slow. Ambiance - Well, it's in CP, so you can expect mix kind of crowd here. Ambiance is good overall, but they need to get good music. Cost - It's expensive when it comes to prices. Food - Food is average,in fact I don't think that the prices are worthy.

They were quite courteous and friendly and took care of everything from spilled drinks, to requests for change in the seating arrangement , to refills for snacks. They were approachable and listened to all personal requests. Oh and yes, special mention for the balcony space, it was quite enjoyable, but a little ill maintained.

Akshat Aggarwal,Rated I visited Ardor for our annual corporate party. At the first look it seemed to be a happening place but as the evening advanced I realised: 1. This place is not ideal for a party of more than 30 people. (we were more than 60..!!) 2. The entire place is divided into parts which makes it very clumsy for a party. 3. Music was not at all going with the mood of the party. Despite repeated requests DJ seemed to be in his own rhythm and was playing lousy music (though I am bit harsh on my words but really can't help it). 4. Apart from us many other people also came in & were literally staring at the girls which actually is a mood spoiler. Since we had booked a party for around 60 people they shouldn't have allowed other people for that evening (especially when it was a weekday) 5. Food was served in a gallery & was too difficult to take the serving. What I liked was the service and the starters. Service was good & taste of food actually compensated for not so good music & ambiance. Probably a place to go in a group of 4-6 people...that may give a fair value for money..,Rated 3.0,29,48,??

Neha Mishra,"Rated A deal on Groupon finally made the long pending visit to Ardor happen on one fine Friday evening. We reached there at around 7 PM and luckily found an empty table on the roof top. The view from there could have been splendid only if the fences were a little lower. As of now you can just see the high rises around which coupled with the open sky and light breeze- ideal for a summer evening in Delhi. Our deal entitled us to have 6 drinks of our choice (domestic) and two starters. Chicken Malai Tikka was well prepared however the serving size was too small, while the second dish we had ordered was garlic chicken which tasted more like boiled chicken chunks without any taste whatsoever. The staff however seemed to be totally confused. We had to repeatedly tell them about the deal and request them to get the stuff. Quite surprisingly there were four more tables laid there and three out of them had the same deal and were facing the same problems. One of the guys sitting right behind us ordered for onion rings and the server just failed to understand (couldn't help myself from eavesdropping, such hilarious was the conversation). As a result he was forced to change his order.

The food is tasty had black dal and murgh malai tikka, good music, decent ambience but not very light on the pocket. The only thing that irked me was the waiter rushing us to place our last order at 11:30pm and asking us to hurry up while we were eating and leave around midnight. It just seemed rude on their part and didn't expect it. Not sure if I will go back after this experience. Giving it 3.5 because of the tasty food and music.",Rated 3.5,77,480,??

Naveen Pachisia,"Rated Very frequent !! Once my colleague suggested this place, I have been been to this place almost 8-10 times. Since I come to this place with friends, have been only to the lounge and the terrace. On the first occasion, we friends from office (around 10) reached the place around 8 on an Friday evening. Dim lights, a full-fledged bar, and a small portion of the floor allocated to shake a leg or two. After 8.30 every weekend they have an in-house DJ who is great while they have dedicated server for each table. Since we were a large number we tried many things on the menu. I do not remember them all; however the ones we all savored were: Hariyali Panner Tikka and Veg Bruchettas were particularly good in veg while non-veg preferred Seekh Kabab and Murgh Lasuni Tikka. For the beverages past, Oreo and Ferrero Rocher were the house favourites. Also the Triple Hukkah (Apple, Pan and Mint) was indeed strong. We also had chance to shake our veg on the old classics to set the mood. Overall it was a handsome experience. Since it was the onset of winters, the open space gives a perfect opportunity to sit idle for hours and view the traffic pass-by. To rate: Music: 7.5/10 (Only if the DJ plays) Food: 6.5/10 (Average; order the regular) Beverage: 7/10 (Shakes highly recommended) Serve: 7.5/10(Dedicated but delay in serve)",Rated 3.5,120,381,??

When we reached there non veg Menu shown to us was different than what was written on groupon site. Last of all when it was time to pay the bill they came up with estimated bill and asked to pay only in cash despite they charging us Rs 750 (inclusive of taxes) per meal . If we are paying taxes then why shud we given non tax paid receipt. This is go directly into there black pocket. BAD Restaurant never go there.,Rated 1.0,1,21,??

I was reluctant in the beginning as I was more inclined to a place which may offer a good buffet at a reasonable price. But then when I checked about this restaurant over the internet, I found great reviews Also I could find people appreciating the quality of ambiance here. Few more of my colleagues agreed to come to this place for dinner. So though I was not very happy with this team decision, I had to went with it. But when I came to this place, it was an entirely different scenario. The ambiance of this place is awesome. We were a big group and so we couldn't get the best corner of the restaurant but definitely got a place which was equally good. The food was of high quality so was the drinks. You definitely should try the Nihari. It was well cooked. We were regularly been advised what to try and what not to order which is really appreciable. Even when we ordered for chapatis, we were advised to order less than what we were doing which was an honest gesture. All of us, came out happily. We were 6, both dining and wining.

Shruti Bhat,"Rated I've been to Ardor twice, once with my friends and once with my mom. When I went with my friends, we were seated out on the terrace lounge, and with my mom, we chose to be seated in the restaurant. The menu was the same, but the service varied a lot. I've had the following at Ardor: Stuffed mushroom caps - This is simply superb! I love mushrooms, and well-prepared stuffed mushroom caps are amongst my favourites. Brilliantly seasoned, they just melt in your mouth. Banjara seekh kabab - You can make out how good a kabab is when it just melts in your mouth (yes, another melt in your mouth dish!). Though personally the seasoning was not completely to my taste, this was still a pretty good dish. Grilled cottage cheese steak - The sauce that is the base of this dish was amazing! To prepare a tangy tomato based sauce that's zesty and zingy is a feat not everyone can achieve perfectly. However, I wish this dish had something to cut the heaviness of the cottage cheese steaks. Even bread would have been welcome, whether as an addition to this dish or in a bread basket on the side. Oreo mint shake - Really, really yummy! Perfectly balanced and surprisingly not very heavy. The portions are quite big. The service was really slow when I was sitting out on the terrace lounge and our order was taken down after a really long while despite us constantly asking for the servers to take it down. However, the service in the restaurant was quick and very friendly. The pricing is decent for the quality for food served. A meal for two should cost about Rs. 1500. Would I come back? Yes! If not for anything else, for the stuffed mushroom caps at least.",Rated 4.0,76,717,??
Yogesh Maini,Rated i tried them on 15th september on my friends birthday party. 5 minutes before 9pm they stopped their happy hours on bar menu. the simply wanted to kill them when they made us wait due to unavailability of seats but i found the section just infront of glass door kitchen completely empty. and that section was not reserved. the ordered food was pathetic especiallly the lasangnia pasta. even the naans & chicken gravy item were bad. i dont think i'll be visitong them again because they dont have strong food to stand by their long menu full of variety.,Rated 1.0,11,4,??
Rahul Taluja,"Rated I got a non veg buffet deal from Times deal for 650 bucks, it seemed a nice one, so went last Sunday. This place used to have Legends Of India earlier, though they have made slight changes to the ambiance. Well our deal included starters, main course and breads. So we started with starters where they served Chicken Malai Tikka, Tandoori Chicken, Chilli Chicken, Mutton Seekh Kebab and Paneer Tikka, and trust me when I say that all of them were just marvelous, especially the Seekh Kebab and Malai Tikka. Both of them were very soft, very juicy and had the perfect taste. We were also served Chicken Sweet Corn soup and that was equally good. The menu included baby pizza and when we ordered it, we were surprised to see a Medium Pizza, so they didn't serve the small ones but a regular pizza (we had ordered Pepperoni) which was very cheesy and yummy. Then we ordered the Chicken Biryani which was not the best or tastiest ever but okay. In main course, we had Kadai Chicken, Mutton Curry and Dal Makhani along with breads. Desserts had Gulab Jamun. At the price I paid, it was definitely worth going, otherwise also, it's a decent place with good ambiance and a great location.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Great Great service, the staff there gave us a warm welcome.. Pulled out our chairs, suggested us good food, asked about the service n the food, suggeus the desert.. Top notch service price..

But for this time my experience on pricing was nice.. 2 starters, 1 Italian main, 1 beer(pint)+taxes.. Rs.1700 The reason I am giving 3.5 coz the stupid incident happened about the lounge..

I find this place through Groupon Deals, but as i am looking for good place so before buying a deal from there, i think that it will be better if i confirmed everything from Ardor itself. My call was received by General Manager itself and he convinced me not to book any deal with Groupon and he will provide me the voucher there only and reassure me that everything that mentioned in the voucher as Full Veg Menu Order and Unlimited Mocktails and soft drink will be available through the voucher. When i reached there with my partner there was no reservation name mentioned for us and they refused us to provide seats in Lounge area, whereas each part of the Ardor was almost empty, when i discuss this with there so called GM, he said to me that he has informed me that on call, whereas we haven't discussed anything in this regard. He even doesn't have the decency to come and discuss it, i have to go to him to discuss this thing after discussing it with other employee repeatedly. To the worst they provide us one page printout menu (2 starter, 2 main course and for beverage they have Cold Drink), just as some cheap restaurant and ask us to choose from it, my plans were ruined and i ask them to provide main Menu and we ordered everything from it after that.

Requesting, shouting, taunting, nothing worked on them... Bt without wasting anymore time we wanted our meals and they again goofed up with the starters for kids, which were 2 serving of nachos and were for some reason presented in 2 different ways. But, finally the food was good and it was great to have both Indian order, Pasta and Nachos all at our table in a go.

Deepika Jamar,"Rated A good place if budget is not limited! CP is a place, which people generally choose to hang out with friends and family, not only because it flaunts Janpath, one of the most famous shoppers-stop, but also because it is lined with beautiful, lavish and fancy restaurants where people generally come for every kind of occasion from bday and kitty parties to formal meetings. One of my friends recommended Ardor and I chose it for my bday. I was not only amazed by the gifts and chocolate cake (oh! did I tell you I am a chocoholic, maybe in my previous reviews), but Ardor also added up to my amusement. As I reached the venue with my friends, we were warmly welcomed by the courteous staff. It is a good place to have dinner because the dim lights and the live music played by a very talented music band fill the ambience with a different energy, one which is certainly pleasing, rejuvenating and charging. This place offers seven different kinds of cuisine under one roof ranging from North Indian to Thai. But you may get confused while deciding on one as the list of dishes goes on and on. However, you can start off with a Haryali Paneer Tikka or a Tandoori Chicken (marinated with yogurt, spices and cooked in day oven). If you love to experiment, then go for Jhinga Dum Nasha. The chefs special Green Salad is a go-go for people who are conscious about their diet and weight. A lot can be chosen for the main-course followed by a chocolaty, smooth and mind-boggling Warm Mud Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. Although all items are a little high on price, the place is worth a visit on any special occasion. There is a long list of amazing beverages that can quench your thirst and melt down your worries. The place swanks off a beautiful interior and comfortable lounge and the walls are adorned with both bold and elegant paintings. Overall, the food is good and ambience is electrifying.

Veg manchow soup appealed as it tasted really good but there were no dry noodles in it which churp out your tongue. It was quite similar to hot n sour soup.

I was already informed that it will be sweet so I cannot complain much. Our main course order was a lone dish, Pan Fried Noodles with Garlic Sauce. We experimented with this and this also did not disappoint us. Right amount of Fried Noodles, Garlic Sauce, broccoli's (personal favourite :-P) made this is a good gamble in the end. Dessert - Walnut brownie and Ice Cream scoops. My Report Pros: Authentic Chinese Food Superb ambience Amazing people around you Quantity vs Cost - justified Huge Servings Cons: Would expect the staff to be trained more, at least in explaining the menu as I was unaware of many delicacies (Menu was loaded with stuff, but the same wasn't reflecting through the waiters) It is irritating to answer questions like ""How is the soup, Sir?"", when I am having my meal. Better provide me with a feedback form later on, but please do not disturb me during a meal. For the first timers! Do not hesitate in visiting this place. Ain't that costly if you order smartly.

But cant really say as do all of them are perfect in taste as I just tasted a bit. There is so much variety to choose from that it almost makes one doubt whether or not they just use the same ingredients for everything! Fortunately, they don't. But then again, selecting a dish is quite a chore. There are loads of alcoholic beverages listed on the menu. More confusing is the part where the steward recommends a drink that is not listed and you go bonkers ! The number of waiters too is above average. One can see so many of them runnng around all the time.It is usually always hopping with customers. I tried some of the Chinese and Indian dishes, so based on that I can confirm that their chefs know their stuff! The chicken was tasty, floating in some hunan-ish gravy.

Niharika.Loves.To.Eat,"Rated CP is usually a difficult place to navigate for anyone who is not a born-and-bred Delhiite, and sometimes not even for those! For newbies, the lack of parking, valet, the dust, pollution and heat can be overwhelming. Also, like all other joints in this area, if you swing by it and miss it, you'd have to take a full round and arrive back. The picturesque market requires its visitors to work hard for the delights it has to offer! The restaurant itself has more than what one can ask for in every aspect.

One can see so many of them runnng around all the time.It is usually always hopping with customers. Even when I went on a weekday, I couldn't find a place in the lounge zone and had to settle for the more sober fine dine area. :( They do, however, have a terrace for the smokers which is great for a picturesque view and is a real bonus if you ask me. However, just too many shenaginans here too! Everything is in excess, rendering you a little bewildered and overwhelmed. Apart from the excesses, it has other features as well. For instance, the hookah fad is very active here. With myriad different flavours available to the young crowd, it becomes a star attraction of the place. The lounge-resto bar music is another luring point for the college goers. The option for fine dining is great too.Those with a lower threshold for noise can stick to this separate floor. The terrace deserves to 'trend', for in the evenings it is lit well and one can spot couples cooing, friends drinking and loners staring into space; in other words, a place for all. It is the first multi cuisine eatery that I have liked after Set'z that but although I like the latter for its posh ambience, I like this one for its relaxed decor and good food. Yes. it makes good food. I tried some of the Chinese and Indian dishes, so based on that I can confirm that their chefs know their stuff! The chicken was tasty, floating in some hunan-ish gravy. The chilly chicken is great too, spicy enough to hot up those taste buds. The kebab platter is wholesome and delicious. A meal for 3, including two starters, two mains, one dessert and drinks was Rs. 2400.

It is expensive, but i do not mind saving money to go and eat at this place.

I am a fussy customer who just cannot accept it if the quality delivered is less than the monetary value, i feel the need to complain and get a good service and experience.

On top of that there management of the issue was so poor that it took them 1 hour and 30 minutes to arrange for an alternate space for us to sit. If this was not enough the food served was not as per the Pre-Set menu sent to them.

I did have a splendid time and really enjoyed my meal peacefully. You should definitely try their food without fail.",Rated 4.5,1,1,??
Nishant Bhardwaj,"Rated Ardor- means passion and trust me, the place is awesome. After entering into it, the only word that I said was ""Waaoooww"". If you are fond of typical north Indian food with a delicacy, you should try it. Their food is great. Coming to the meal, I found Rogan josh a very different and spicy dish over here. A kick start for your lunch or dinner. Great!!! I did not go for biryani this time and took lachha paratha which was good too. At the end the kulfi was very yummy. In a single word, the lunch was memorable and my belly was too happy. Full marks to Ardor.",Rated 5.0,1,1,??

Erica  Collins,"Rated Every time I go to Connaught Place i explore a new place. This time it was Ardor and so I went there over dinner, and it had to be really good as it was a real special night for me. So we went in sat by the big window panes and it was an awesome view. The high ceiling with large lights hanging down in copper colour shades were adding to the atmosphere and making the place look much bigger. The atmosphere is extremely romantic and perfect for romantic dates. The staff is so courteous, we asked them to click pictures for us and they were kind enough to take us to their staircase and took amazing pictures for us (this is rare :o) the ambience just pulls you in. we ordered for a Murgh lasuni kabab, Mutton dum biryani, sweet lime soda, Rarrah gosht in main course and Matka kulfi in desserts. The Murgh lasuni kabab was cooked to perfection and the Mutton dum biryani was beyond words with tender and lots of mutton pieces and the Rarrah gosht was yum too They have lots of Indian dessert options Teela kulfi, Chocolate mousse, Apple pie etc. We had Matka kulfi which was lovely. The bill was not cheap but it is acceptable as the quantity was good so was the taste and the staff behavior. This is a must go and you won't be disappointed. One of the many very good and classy Indian restaurants in town. :)",Rated 5.0,1,1,??

Siddharth Aggarwal,"Rated We went to Ardor 2-3 times and I am writing this review as I am satisfied with their service, food quality and quantity every time I pay visit to this place. 1st time, we were only 2 and ordered Veg Pizza and some cocktails. Both were perfect and value for money was superb. This time we went with a group of friends so tried different variety there. We ordered Paneer tikka ajwaini, Ajwani machhi tikka, Murgh lasuni kabab, Banjara seekh kabab.I loved all these dishes as they were properly cooked, normal spice level plus presentation was also great. So overall my rating for this restaurant goes like this: Ambiance: 4/5 Food 4.5/5 Quality 4/5 Quantity 4/5",Rated 4.5,1,1,??
Shikha Kapoor,"Rated The restaurant which opened in place of Legends of India. Finally got a chance to visit this place, I am saying finally because once I attempted to go to this place earlier also, however, due to lack of parking space and no valet service was not able to visit. This time we went for a quite dinner and thus chose to sit on the First Floor fine dining area instead of the Second Floor lounge area. Best part of looking at the menu was that there were so many cusines that it was difficult to select one. They offer North Indian, Mughlai, Continental, Italian, Asian, Chinese, Thai.... so they have pretty much everything on their Menu and you as a customer end up confused on what to order and what not! We went for North Indian and ordered Dal Makhni, Kadai Paneer along with normal tandoori breads. The food was fresh but lacked spices, the taste was quite bland. Service was decent and dint take much time in bringing the food after taking the order. Not discounting the place just because of the bland taste of North Indian food, would like to try it once more and go for may be Chinese or Italian. It was Value For Money (VFM) though, it costed around INR 1100 for two people, which is quite nominal. Final Verdict - Yes, go ahead and try it.",Rated 4.0,109,527,??

Monika Shrivastav,"Rated Came to Ardor Connaught Place on Saturday! It was 8 pm when we entered and we were sent to the roof top section. It was quite empty and downstairs seemed crowded. Within no time we had the snacks and drinks center the table and being a vegetarian we had different varieties of veg snacks. The sauce smeared on them is spicy and yummy. I must tell you Khumb achari, Kabab Platter were finger licking delicious. There was also the Paneer tikka ajwaini though a bit bland the paneer was soft. If you have a good appetite then just go for it, There was a valentines offer where u got a drink free with another. I took a fruit punch and my husband had scotch. My 2 year old son was running all around the place and the staff were very kind enough to take care of him without letting him get hurt anywhere. It was a very sweet gesture of them, without us mentioning they brought my son a plate of French fries and some mango juice, he was very happy. The waiter and the chef himself came to our table more than twice inquiring for the taste and quality of the food. They had a huge spread for the main course, lots of salad options, soup, noodles and a gravy to go with, many North Indian dishes, biriyani etc. The dessert section had neatly arranged brownies, gulab jamoon, ice-cream and freshly cut fruits All in all had a wonderful time, excellent food, even better service. This place definitely deserves a 5 rating or more. Highly recommend!!",Rated 5.0,1,1,??

Nimish Kapoor,"Rated Never ever go to ardor even if they are serving the food free.last saturday i bought a deal on groupon.com which includes unlimited drinks & 2 starters .first of all the staff is totally ignorant about any such offer and after 15 -20 minutes they told me that i can only get vodka or beer while we were asking for whiskey.After much argument we decided to take vodka .The service there after was horrible many people who came after us were getting their food while we were still waiting. Their starters were kind of shockers, in Paneer tikka there were 4 tiny pieces of paneer & the same goes on with all starters that follows. I don't know why these people give these kind of offers online when they don't have any wish to oblige the same .On top of it the owner of the place was busy talking with foreigners about how to get admission in collages abroad . It was a very bad experience. So Ardor is a big No for me.",Rated 1.0,1,84,??

IN the words of my wife, ""you can blindly try anything on the menu and it will certainly be tasty"". This sentiment and the fact that it offers an unforgettable experience keep you thinking about the place, long after your meal. WE went there for a small celebration and ordered murgh seena kebabs, butter naan, kulcha and the biryani. All of the dishes were cooked to perfection; they were delivered at specific intervals without too much of delays. Absolutely lip smacking experience. IF there was something that we didn't enjoy, it was the price as well as the dessert selection. For 2 people it came up to Rs 3000.

On the onset the restaurant looked lively, happy and bright, high ceilings, warm lighting gave it a cozy, eclectic feel. The staff was warm, friendly and spoke well and Service throughout was prompt and helpful. The first course was an appetizer of Kache kele aur rajmah ki tikki, Tandoori pomfret, Seekh kabab. Simple, elegant and nice - a pleasant beginning. This was followed by Ardor Paneer makhani, which was absolutely out of this world Nihari, Kadhai murgh, Kadahi paneer. The food was simply outstanding. It took me some time to regain my senses - no honestly but when I did we were presented Chocolate mousse, Warm mud cake that took me on a different trip. My god - I need to come back for more of this. Indeed one of the finest gastronomical expeditions I have had in a long time, so close to home and so friendly.

Simi Tagore,"Rated I took my family out for a celebratory meal and had an absolutely lovely experience at Ardor. It being a weekday, I made reservations in the morning of the same day and got a booking for four promptly with courteous service. Upon arriving at the restaurant, the maitre de found our reservation immediately and led us to a quiet table for four in one of the corners near the wine cabinet. This table was a bit cold due to the air conditioning vents at the top, so we asked to be moved to another table and our request was immediately followed through and we were moved to another well-lit table close by that was much warmer. The ambience of the place is absolutely fantastic. The decor is simple and yet very classy, the restrooms are spotless. Now moving on to the food -- What can I say we were all completely blown away, Being a family of vegetarians, I feared a limited choice based on other reviews I read, but on reaching the restaurant, we noticed that the menu was much larger than what is posted on this website, with several vegetarian options, and the waiters are excellently informed and more than happy to advise on menu items that could be tailored according to specific requests. For an appetizer, we started with the highly recommended Khumb Achari, Crispy Spinach & Corn Rolls, which is completely worth the hype. This, along with the complimentary bread basket served at the beginning, did more than enough to tickle the tastebuds of a ravenous family and leave us eagerly looking forward to what the mains had in store. For the mains, we had between the four of us Vegetable Lasagna, Cottage Cheese Shashlik, Assorted Asian Greens in Red, Yellow or Green Thai curry, Each dish was exceptional, and a special mention must be made to the quality and flavour of the mushrooms used in the dishes; they were truly exceptional and of varieties I had never seen before, either in India or abroad. The portions, although appearing modest in the beginning, are more than sufficient as each dish is succulent, luscious and decadent, which is a lot of adjectives to use for restaurant-vegetarian food, but the accolades are truly well-deserved. Finally, stuffed to our gills, we ordered one dessert to share between the four of us, which, again, was exceptional. To end with -- downsides? The only most obvious drawback I found (not so much a downside) is the price; this place makes no bones about the fact that if you want quality, exceptional food, you need to be willing to pay the price, but for an occasional treat to the tastebuds, I would return to this restaurant in the blink of an eye. However, I will raise my eyebrows to the alcohol prices. Although we didn't drink any alcohol during this visit, even a quick look at the wine list indicated alarming figures on the right-hand. This is definitely a place I would be hesitant to visit if I expected to consume a lot of alcohol, but purely as a food destination, this is absolutely a delight. Contrary to what a few other reviewers noted, I didn't really get the feeling that this was a very uppity, snobbish establishment. During my visit, I found a wide variety of patrons, all of whom appeared to be enjoying the food, drink and the overall experience, so I could be loathe to dismiss the place as too high-brow. We were pleased and wonderfully surprised by the quality and warmth of the service, and would like to thank the management and staff of Two One Two for a fantastic experience.",Rated 5.0,1,1,??
Sudha Jamwal,"Rated Excellent Place. Awesome Authentic Pizzas'. Lovely Place for a First Date Food: Excellent Pizzas, Awesome Breads to die for.... Food of good quality. Portions are really good. A starter and a pizza is more than sufficient for 2 or 3. Don't forget the free bread basket on the table is to be hogged upon. Liquor: Nice Collection of wines. An huge option on the drinks. The Indian alcohols and cocktails not expensive. Service: The service was excellent. The staff seemed to be pleasant. Non Intrusive. Time taken for serving is about 15 mins. Aesthetics: The best thing about the place is the location. Absolutely peaceful. You can actually go and sit outside on the terrace . The inside is very well done. Ample seating. And they don't mind you sitting there sipping on wine extremely slowly. Menu: This is tough as half of the things on the menu i couldn't even decipher if i had a translator along with me. Food is yummy, though very little for the only chicken eaters. Pricing is on the higher side. Final verdict: I will certainly be going here again. At least once a month, just for the peaceful dinner.",Rated 5.0,1,1,??
Zara Adwani,"Rated Looking for a good fine-dine place? This place is definitely worth considering. A really nice fine dine restaurant,that serves some yummy food and yummier desserts Food - Very well presented and cooked to perfection. I was really impressed by each and every dish that we called for. I really loved this stuffed mushroom caps that looked so delicious and tasted even better. That was followed by Crispy European Platter another really nice dish. That was followed by the Walnut Chocolate Brownie that looked like some work of art, absolutely amazingly presented and tasted nice too. The drinks menu was quite extensive, though we didn't try any of it. Ambiance - The entrance to the building isn't impressive at all and I was not too sure about how this place would turn out to be. But once I entered the restaurant it was a completely different experience. Nice and spacious, spaced out seating with the bar and dessert counter. It looked really nice perfect for a nice, quiet dinner I thought. (With such delicious food on the table, I guess everybody just prefers to quietly relish every bite) Service - Really warm and enthusiastic staff who make you feel welcome. Right from the time you enter the place, where you are greeted, till when you leave the place, the staff make you feel really comfortable. And the service was quick too.

First floor is kind of formal dining and second floor if a plush lounge with DJ and dance floor pretty nicely centered. Ardor is overall a decent place to be minus the service which I assume is almost bad everywhere in Delhi when it comes to a larger group to cater. Food seemed just in the shade of being decent and ambiance is something which complements one's mood well. Sitting in the terrace on a foggy wintery typical Delhi night with the shades of yellow colored by streetlights is a delightful setting. Second floor is suitable for a larger group but when you are out with a friend or two, I would rather recommend to be placed in the formal dining area only due to extra large couches which are placed in the lounge area.

Rahat Chawla,"Rated Went there after seeing the menu on Zomato, which seemed interesting. Sat in the fine dining area. The bacon wrapped prawns were stale, so was the lettuce in the chicken Caesar salad. The chicken steak was average. The service was slow. The servers didn't know what sauces they were serving - BBQ sauce was identified as tomato sauce. Got the entrees before the appetizers. The menu was pretty good, the execution was very poor. Not at all value for money. Wouldn't visit again. However, they can do wonders if they improve the quality of food and it's presentation. Ambience is good and this place has the potential to be a hit! ----- 19 Jan, 2013 ----- I went there after seeing all the glowing reviews, and the pictures looked good as well! Well, the place is a disappointment. I chose to sit in the fine dining area - the service was poor and slow, the servers didn't know they were serving me barbecue sauce and kept telling me it was 'red sauce' they were calling another sauce 'hummus'. The menu is well conceptualized, but the execution was much below par. The lettuce in the Caesar salad tasted old. And the bacon in the bacon wrapped prawns tasted double fried and stale. They didn't bring the food in order. Got the mains out first and the salad was more of a dessert served later after all was done! Overall, the terrace had no view, it wasn't value for money, wasn't fine dining from any aspect. Never going there again!",Rated 2.0,24,214,??

The food was nice and quick. The menu options were a little limited and they can make it better by maybe adding more cuisines to it. But overall Ardor has a nice food experience. Also they have a lounge on the second floor maybe good for like parties and evening get together. The price I dont remember much because this was long back but i think it was not really high.

Radicalz,"Rated True to its name, the lounge embodies the character of Old and New Delhi with great fervor - a perfect amalgamation of the colonial era and the modern chic architecture. Two distinct floors provide varied seating options depending on the occasion. One dedicated to fine dining is appropriate for a family dinner complete with plush sofa seating, wood paneled walls, some of which are fitted with flat screen TVs (I like the additional touch of technology in the midst of this almost-regal decor). Even the menu has something for everyone from traditional Indian to Chinese, Mediterranean platter and palatable European fare, attributable to the classic 'Delhi chef conundrum' of pleasing one to all. What distinguishes this lounge is the spectacular view of Connaught Place and surrounding areas . It also has a view of Parikrama, the Revolving Restaurant, most oft the place for aerial dining. Ardor provides a less formal environment that is also easier on the wallet and mighty pleasing to the eyes.",Rated 3.0,83,722,??
Juliana Karp,"Rated We've been to this place a couple times, the first as our first meal out and the second tonight. Both times some of the items we wanted to order were not available. My date was also dissatisfied with the portion sizes. Though I (a pretty small chick) was full after my pasta dish, it still was smaller than I've expected from restaurants-- definitely in the states but even abroad and in India. He stopped by McDonalds on our way home, though. Their Indian food is pretty good as we remember it, though tonight we ordered American dishes instead. Which were good. I thoroughly enjoyed both of them, though I found the salad extremely overpriced. I assumed it was due to the meat, but the chicken was of minimal quality. I thought it was amusing that the ""exotic vegetable"" in the mac n cheese was a garnish of thinly sliced bell peppers. The drinks in particular are extremely expensive. Despite this, the ones I've had (five or so) are actually great, especially in presentation. However, I'll make exception with the beer tonight. We arrived just in time for happy hour, but the choice of benefit was between about three beers. The one my date chose was still overpriced, but fair for a double order. When it arrived it looked like the pourer had never heard of beer before. The head was huge and it tasted poorly stored on top of being overall poor beer. It wasn't so bad that it was worth wasting, luckily. The desserts are par for the course, I think. The first night we had the apple pie, which was good, and tonight we had the lukewarm chocolate mousse, which was smothered in thin chocolate sauce. They aren't egregiously expensive luckily. A bright spot is the ice cream-- it's served with both dishes and is delicious. Though it's not unusual, the waiter gave the bill to my date and explained the drink deduction on it without deigning to acknowledge or address me. I was the one paying, but as usual I ignored it and just quietly slid it to myself after he left. I appreciate that they take credit cards. On top of that, it took 15 minutes after asking (twice) for the bill to arrive. Other than that the service was attentive, polite, and generally everyone I could ask for. And I take service quality seriously. Overall, 3/5. Great food and service, ambiance, and professionalism. Due to location, probably, prices are more inflated than they should be, especially for drinks. You can find better places regarding the bang for your buck in Connaught Place, but if you're not on a budget, it is very well run and comfortable. Just don't count on everything you want on the menu being available. In short, good place for a wide range of food (the full menu is only available in the restaurant, not in the lounge or balcony), but it's pricey for what it's worth.",Rated 3.0,17,9,??

Hitindersingh,"Rated I went to this place for the very first time, didn't find any problem to locate it since it is adjacent to the famous Blues in CP. As I entered the stairs, I started to realise that the management is still to improve a lot since there were no signages on stairs and there are a couple of more places on the way up. Finally I reached the Ardors after struggling a bit in stairs and entering a couple of other places which are at first floor. As I entered the place, the ambiance was warm with music buzzing and good large screen with a cricket match going on, but soon I got struck again since there was no one to attend me to find a table to sit since were 8 friends. Service levels are very poor, seating plan again very poor, seats are not at all comfortable, and sofas are too high than Table level. The worst part came when I had to wait for 10 minutes for the right menu to reach me. I felt like leaving this place but my friends were not in mood to go somewhere else so we settled down. The order came after some 30minutes and only after complaining to the manager a waiter started to look after us. Funniest thing, waiters were busy watching the match rather than serving the customers, and the manager was super busy in some stuff too. finally the drinks came, and it was the end of the night due to hell lot of awesome service by the Ardors. Last but not least, I asked a waiter to refill my drink and he brought me the checkout bill, huffff. That was all about bitter part, but there was one single better part too, lucky it was a sufi night so the singer came and he made the evening live. The best one I had ever experienced in delhi, live music and he was too good. he introduced himself as Raj, sung beautiful songs incorporating all the requests of all people. Rest, a nice place to hang out with friends, but do ask the manager for a good service and if that is not assured its better to checkout than spoiling your evening.",Rated 1.0,1,2,??

Can't get enough of ardor during my first visit and quite a surprising experience to be honest with such a vibrant menu and rock bottom prices.
