Sachin Bobal,"Rated Odeon social is the new addition to the social legacy. From ambience to food to service to the entrance as well ,everything was just mind blowing. The servers wearing school uniform and the mark sheet board definitely takes you back to ur school days. The service was fast and efficient. Ordered: a glass of Sula satori Merlot Malbec ,cheese Masala pao,chilly paneer black pepper box,shawarma wrap,yo mama. Chilly paneer black pepper box was excellent. The sauce was perfectly made. Shawarma wrap was delicious. Garlic mayo and fries were the stars. The masala used on the fries reminded me of fries from McDonald's. Cheese masala pao!!lip smacking is the correct word. Loved it to last bite. I was full but still couldn't resist myself from finishing he dish. Overall it's an amazing new place in cp and a must try.",Rated 4.5,78,494,??
Gaurav Verma,"Rated Odeon Social is the newest addition to already crowded market of cafe, bars and lounges in CP. The newly open joint lives up to the expectation of Social franchise. The ambience is different not only from other cafes and bars in CP but also from other Social outlets. With decor theme of back to school seating options are available either on table with big typewriters and bench style seating. In the outside area there are two swings which actually take you back to the school. Now coming to menu, they have good options out there in food and drinks. The special back to school menu is offers value for money. We ordered the Famous Social Margarita, which comes with an ice candy though flavours mentioned on menu were not available and Hajmola shots. The drinks were innovative and were made nicely. In food we ordered Mezze Platter which was good for three people, China box, which was decent take on noodle bowl and twist on a tikki from their back to school menu, which had right flavours with hash brown and wasabi raayta. Coming to service, well everyone around us was being served pretty quickly but guess there was something wrong with server at our table so will discount that part. Overall, a nice place to hangout.",Rated 4.0,14,185,??
Gaurav Prakash,"Rated After listening to great reviews about the newly opened Odeon Social, I decided to give this place a try. I went here yesterday with a friend of mine. It's easily accessible, located just above the Odeon BIG cinemas. Or just in front of the Famous Odeon Paan wala. Ambiance and Interiors: The place has an automatic door to start with. Classy! We went upstairs and it was a nicely lit, school themed restaurant and everything around you will remind you of school times. the walls, the antiques placed at different places give the place a really good feel about it. I didn't like the music much but it wasn't that bad, either! Even the tiles in the washroom are printed with charts we used back in the school days ( how to keep villages clean, etc). The outlet is huge. Like really huge! And they have a corner where you get Hanging charging ports. I found it really contemporary and next gen. Kudos! Check the pictures for more understanding. Crew and Menu : I found the crew really responsive and happy to help. It felt like they were trained to care for the patrons. A crew member escorted us to a 2 seater table and another one came by to check how we liked the food. The service is quick and it's a pretty nice effort, overall. Not to forget, the crew is dressed in a school uniform. And they are happy to get clicked with! The menu is pretty exhaustive , though the veg options are farely limited. Cannot comment on the alcohol part, since we din order any. Food : Let's come to the main part now. The service is reasonably quick. We ordered the Ferrero Rocher And Odeon Social Shake and i found the shakes really good. The quantity, not so much. I feel it's too less for 190 when compared to the shakes i have had in different places. Also, the shakes come paired with two wafers, which is a okay sort of combination. We ordered the Paneer makhani biryani and it was really delicious. It was a perfect quantity for 2 people and came with curd raita and Indian fries! I would rate the preparation and presentation a 5/5. We also ordered the Penne Pasta in Tomato Sauce, It came in a box and was good. I liked the biryani more, though. But my friend liked it since he's more of a pasta person. We clicked a few pictures of the property which you can check with the review . Overall, it is a reasonably price place(except for the shakes) and i feel that it doesn't really cost too much for such a good time! I had a great time and i look forward to coming back Overall 4/5 Cheers!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Vikas Joon,Rated Finally went to odeon social and yes it was amazing experience. First of all thank you manager - don't remember his name but he was check blazer thank you for your sweet gesture and service not only him guys being bar and serving on table every single person was so sweet and caring listening to our order carefully getting things on time it was total 5 star treatment and this was on weekend when its completely crowded.

Amar Sirohi,"Rated When i got to know that an outlet of social has opened in cp, i couldn't resist myself from going there. Situated in the Odeon building under the big cinemas it is a big big place which has both indoor and outdoor sitting. It has the high school theme, the school uniform like dress of waiters, wooden chairs and tables with typewriters and telephones, trophies cabinet, ruler printed holders..even the utensils..everything will remind yu of your school days. Be ready to experience nostalgia. Full marks to the creative mind behind it. I spent only 20-25 minutes here as i had my movie show so I ordered jalapeno mac n cheese with parmesan crust, which was unavailable. Then i asked for Bombay bachelor sandwich, which tasted like vada paav. It was good but had something lacking..and was a bit dry for my taste. It could have been better. This rating is mainly for their interiors and service..i'll come back here soon..will try few more dishes and will update this review.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Akhil Chugh,"Rated Visited on Monday night with my colleagues and the place was reasonable packed considering the day. The place has perhaps the best and fastest service I have ever seen in Delhi. Hats off. They were sending out stuff from kitchen as speeds that could put fast food restaurants to shame. The food itself was decent but not great. Menu options still remain limited and the portion sizes were small, typically good for 1-2 people. The Goan prawn curry and Sharwaman platter are worth a try. Stay away from the Parsi options in the menu, they are pretty average.",Rated 4.0,43,121,??
Aarti Ahuja,"Rated Another social ticked marked but the small stomach and friends Tuesday sentiment kept me away from non veg delights. The wonderful staff helped my friend with the selection of vegetarian options, we went along with recommended chinese bhel and potato skins Chinese bhel crispy and crunchy but when street food goes upscale and hygiene flavour of the street dirt goes amiss. The manchurian balls were a bit small but as it was in the munchies section it could be a bit bigger. Potato skins with three different kinds of cheese, totally well cooked but lacked the chives flavour and could be more crispy on the outside. It cut through like ordinary boiled potato no sound of the crispy skin rustling along the knife. It can be served with salsa and sour cream adds depth to the cheesey flavours. Well I will have to be back for sure to this social as well, it seems social will make me social again Keep it up",Rated 4.0,40,461,??

Sahil Arora,"Rated Social!! I love this place, everything about it is fun and different be it the food, drinks or the decor. Odeon social has gone with the 'back to school' theme and they have nailed it. The food and drinks are the same as at any other social but they do have a small new menu that include a few new cocktails as well. I must say that social is the only place that is capable of making and maintaining a good standard for their cocktails. I must recommend old monk kala khatta and old monk jal jeera (spoiler alert: they are served in banta bottles). For food we just ordered a shwarma platter which was good too. The service was quick and prompt so you wont have to worry abt sitting idle waiting to order. To sum up i would say definitely visit the place, its social after all....what cld go wrong!!",Rated 4.5,7,1,??
Aaron Bhajan,"Rated Lovely space and very innovative drinks ... Hajmola shots are a must try ... They also serve some mixology in traditional lemonade""banta"" bottles ..

Meenakshi Srivastav,"Rated It was Valentines Day Eve when I popped into this place. It is located just in the heart of Connaught place. As I entered this place, I was mesmerized by the ambience, it was simply wow.... DJ was playing rocking songs and the crowd was dancing on the tunes. This place flaunts school theme with trophies, pencils & rulers etc. It has a huge open & indoor sitting area with varied seating options including swings (Jhoola). Before coming to this place, we also tried some other restro-bar but due to Valentine Eve they were failed to accommodate us. So, as decided, it was our second option for Valentines eve. As we reached here, despite the busy hours the Manager & staff were very prompt in providing good service and managed good couches/sofa for us. We ordered LIIT & Sangria with Southall Fish & Chips, Crispy Sesame Honey Chilli Fries, Jalapeno Cheese Nads, Sriraja Paneer Chilli, Chilli Chicken Rice, Kerala Coin Parathas & Chicken Baida Roti. They took hardly 10-15 minutes and everything was on our table. The food was Scrumptious, crispy and yummy. We tried the following:- Kerala Coin Paranthas, these fingers licking Coin Parathas were topped with Lal Maas, Sukka Chicken and Paneer. Jalapeno Cheese Nads, were stuffed with Cheese & crushed Jalapeno and very creamy & yumm in taste. Toothsome Chicken Baida Roti, stuffed with sumptuous minced chicken (served with green apple chutney) They served Southall Fish & Chips with sauce; they were very crispy & juicy. Sesame Honey Chilli Fries were sweet & sour in taste. Sriraja Paneer Chilli taste was something like Chinese Chatt and delectable to taste buds. Chilli Chicken rice was just awesome in taste. The staff here is quite courteous and service is also good; especially one of the members of their staff whose name is Sumit was very active & prompt as he made all his efforts to serve us the best. One word for the place fantastically amazing. Be there and enjoy. Highly recommended.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Sheena Kaushik,"Rated I happen to visit this place on last thursday and it was my friends bday so it was a special day for me.I reserved a table and was given multiple options to choose from as per my comfort. Location & Ambience Located in Odeon building its very easy to locate in the heart of delhi CP.. Its based on "" school theme"" and interiors are well done..from old shields, to typewriters to home science halls you will get to see it all here..I loved using pencils.. All my apprehensions about this place went for a toss as i am a regular visitor in Social Hauzkhas. After a few minutes waiter very warmly asked me if i need any help in selecting menu and explained me all vegetarians available options. Food In starters we ordered Cheese Nachos and french fries along with Electric LIIT and beer. They have good variety of domestic drinks also available in stock unlike other bars in CP where the standard reply is ""non available"". We liked starters as well as variety of drinks like "" rum kala khatta"". Their drinks and food in all respects is amazing and staff is very helpful and warm. They helped us in my friends bday cake cutting as well. They have a separate smoking area/outdoor seating for ones who like to smoke. We got a chance to meet the restaurant manager "" Abhishek"" who not only ensured he met us, took our feedback but he also served us complimentary "" pan pasand"" shots on occasion of my friend""s bday. Thanks "" Abhishek"" for the lovely gesture.

Nakul Khanna Aka CorporateGypsy,Rated The restaurant is based on 1st floor of legendary odeon! It's the hottest place in CP right now. From the menu to crowd to service everything is awesome and worth trying. The only issue that you may face is too many walk-ins. Plan your visit carefully; book a table first. Try LLIT and sausages; both are nice.,Rated 4.5,63,190,??

Shreya Saxena,"Rated Social just nailed it with their ""back to school"" theme. Absolutely loved the decor and little board of St. Marks, Meera bagh in a corner rekindled the fond memories from my first school. The music was a little loud for my taste but the tracks played gelled well with the ambience. The food served is drool worthy and totally value for money. Full marks to the extensive menu (from every corner of India) and innovative presentation. Tried chicken biriyani and baida roti and absolutely relished the delicious flavour. Odeon social is now officially my favourite hangout place with the lively atmosphere and pleasant staff. Reccomended if you plan to hangout with friends/significant other and have a long relaxing chitchat",Rated 4.5,5,37,??
Neerpriya Bakshi,"Rated Went to the recently opened Social @Odeon. This is located right above the Odeon Big cinemas. Don't get deceived by the 'lift' like entrance- they lead you to a staircase and then you enter a place that sends you back to your old school days. Yes, social here is themed on school. The staff wears green dps like school uniforms, furniture reminds you of the school desk and benches, there is a ruler and a pencil too at the tables and they even have a principal's room there. Apart from the ambiance, rest is the same as other socials. The only difference is that they have some new drinks added to the menu which are quite exciting- like old monk jal jeera and vodka aam panna. Apart from this there is a heavy 33% alcohol tax which has been added which adds a bulge to your bill. We ordered the fully loaded nachos and the tennesse wings. Damages were decent. Can visit for the old school charm with decent food.",Rated 3.0,43,227,??
Medha Sehtia,"Rated The seating could be a bit more comfortable. The preparation and cost are just Social being the Social brand. Didn't like the beet and pear salad too much but it was well prepared, just not my thing. The pancakes and scrambled egg breakfast was tummy wellness happiness. Their toasted bread is super sad. The chicken Bao is great comfort food. Tikka tacos are a little oiler than they should've been. Overall.",Rated 4.0,28,297,??
Vivek Saini,"Rated Refreshingly unique and surprisingly calming. Just like other social branches , the menu for both food and drinks is pretty standard , with similar taste and quality. Perhaps , what does distinguish this outlet from others is the striking ambience. I couldn't just get enough of it. From typewriter artifact on the table , to the huge bookshelf , to the square window pane wall on one side , everything about the ambience is spectacular. The staff is well trained and courteous. A southern fried chicken burger and a glass of red sangria fetched us a bill of rs. 800 approx ( all inclusive ). It's an experience worth having at least once. Looking forward to visiting again.",Rated 3.5,79,119,??
Gurinder Pal Singh,"Rated I got a chance to get a sneak peek of brand spanking new Odeon Social, Connaught Place. Social Offline is known for its out of the box approach and quirky twist to food. What caught our fancy were the interiors, which was influenced by Back To School theme. Step into the restaurant and everything from old typewriters to rotary dial telephone to wall full of trophies & book shelf, is reminiscent of school days! Tasted quite a few dishes and will share my favorites Awesamosa Super crisp samosa stuffed with cheese & mushrooms served with Sriraja Chunda & Green Chutney. Samosas were so crispy, airy & delicious, one of the favorite food items. Double Grilled Naga Chilli Cheese Toast When a dish has naga chili in it, you would expect it to be smoking hot , but thankfully it was crisp & moderately spicy. Chili Chicken Good old chili chicken with capsicum. Chicken was tender and juicy from the inside and crisp from outside. Butter Chicken Biryani We did find the name intriguing. The dish was a winner with buttery chicken layered in the bottom of the pan with fragrant rice & crispy onions on the top. In desserts Chocolate Blood Bath Most loved dessert !! Also in cocktails dont miss Longest Long Island Iced Tea, Game of Sling & Cosmo are highly recommended. Overall its a fun place to hangout with friends saadidilli.com",Rated 4.0,35,5335,??

They really thought this one through. It really fulfils your dream of drinking while you were in school! The menu remains the same. The food presentations changed according to the theme.

The thing i would highly appreciate about the place is the service , it was like we ordered and the things were in front of us (5/5). In beverages we ordered for homemade lemonade and social shake...both were good with a refreshing taste. In food menu we ordered for pancakes and butter chicken biryaani...it was my first time for pancakes so i can not comment upon them but yes i liked it's taste , the best thing was the butter chicken biryaani , the chicken was sooooo delicious.

Bharat Singhal,"Rated ODEAN SOCIAL :D This place was in wishlist always and will be always. well I had awsome experience at odean social. Ambience : 5/5 as it took me back to school, the badge , headmaster & the library. plus the booze & the food, where is better school than this? :P the classy seating arrangements as classroom benches and some head boy/girl chairs and long bamboo stick in headmasters hands, water bottle, candy, and lots more i dont even remember , would love to visit again & again. Food : 4/5 , crispy aloo tikki, completely failed me , i was like delhi6 can be failed but odean social chalanged and won. typical serving in patta topped with tamaring chutney & curd. chilly paneer - best was crispy noodles on top, gave it crispiness and awsome delight in eating, i had it all. chilli cheese toast- nostalgic about lunch box , the delight, simplicity & delicious. though a bit dry as compared to but it was totally same as mom made for lunch those days cheese nuggets - poppers, like a cheese blast. with perfect tangy sauce. was on repeat mode. no better explanation for that. SHOTS 5/5: No better shooters to drool you. AAMPANNA, JALJEERA, RUM & KACHAAAM ,WATERMELON TOO. was again on repeat, then i took a cab :P electric liit 4/5: the large, tha tall & the shocking. LIIT was literally rocking. i could have one but there is no better around. superbly derived. there were non veg dishes too, which i couldn't click, as my non veggie friends were too hungry but there reactions told me, this place has it all for everyone. i would recommend it for sure. my take is 4.5/5. have a visit. you'll love the space.",Rated 4.5,26,92,??

Vabss,Rated As the name suggest this is a youngest sister franchise of social (hauzkhas). But as expected this place has landed into same faith as its middle sister (def col). Both the places failed to match the standard of HKV Social. Area wise its the smallest out of three and ambience wise its stands last in a row. Food is same everywhere so nothing new here. With the brand name of 'social' this place has failed to maintain its own independent identity in market. If u have visited the Original one than there is no point coming here.,Rated 2.0,93,66,??

Then after waiting for 15-20 minutes, which seemed extra long at such a crowded place, we finally got a place to sit. I literally loved achmed's mezze platter, how beautifully it was brought. Red sauce penne and paneer tikkas were also quite scrumptious. Drinks were chilled and too good. Social has definitely played well with the theme. All over the experience was not bad.

Balkirat Singh,"Rated We went to this newly opened #Social outlet in CP after watching a movie. We had pre booked a table for 6 PM and the place was jam packed. The downside was that the management did not honor the promise of providing a decent table even after me ensuring the table reservation 3 hours in advance. We were made to sit outside where just a single table was there and also opened to smoking. Then after making several request we were seated inside on one of the table. But after this initial downside, the whole ambience and innovative menu offerings cheered us up. We ordered Samosa with Cholley which was served in a tiffin box - thumbs up for presentation and taste. Also ordered Chinese meal box which had a generous portion - paired with a Green colored Khus and Chilli Mocktail. The evening was ended with a Chocolate Blood Bath dessert which was the winner. The overall experience was good if not better. Will head next to their HKV outlet and see what it has to offer.",Rated 4.0,34,282,??

Rahul Yadav,"Rated I went for the Sunday brunch with my bestie to this. Frankly had no idea about this place and I didn't see zomato for the ratings before I entered here. My friend highly recommended this place and this was the closest place. Ambience in the place is not the best. But we were fortunate to get a good seat and so the ambience was not the issue. Music is terrible, seriously they need to update the playlist. Plus the song selection was pretty boring and uneven and so that was a dampener Food : Started with the guava peach punch, and I will remember it for the rest of my life. Not because of the taste but for the combination. Guava, mint and chilli are not the best of combination but I was still better than some of drinks I have had at fancy places. However a refreshing change. We ordered Tikka Tacos - which were good. The tacos were good and the tikka chicken inside it was properly cooked and served hot, which along with mint chutney was a delight. Also ordered a cheese bread toast - forgot the name- which was way too cheesy. I am not a big fan of cheese so I tasted only one and it was terrible for me but the texture was good and the bread was crunchy, so it was probably my hate of cheese which made it worse. My friend seemed to enjoy it a lot and so I would rate it good. My friend suggested that we tried the Biryani for here so we tried the Paneer Makhani Biryani. The rice was cooked properly ,however the biryani fragrance and feel was missing somehow. The blend of Paneer was thorough and props to them for making me eat Paneer twice. The dish left no bad aftertaste and the palate felt good while eating. Service was good. We were served the orders in time and there was no unnecessary wait. The service outfit was kinda school themed which was pretty wierd Will visit it next time for some new try outs",Rated 3.5,52,237,??

Rohini Gauba,"Rated With 'Back to School' basics, Social has played well with the theme. Wooden staircase, shields displayed on one of the walls, swings in the balcony, scoreboard for the toppers and a lot many detailing with the furniture. The school environment from the 80's-90's has been re-created pretty well. Servers dressed in School Uniforms approach with tablets in their hands to take your orders. When I went to Social on a Saturday evening, a bit of retro music was being played and a group of people were dancing in one corner. The menu is exactly the same as HKV's social. Vegetarian Mezze Platter: To be really specific, it is meant for three people. Pita Pockets are served with Falafels, Hummus, Tahini and a few other other Lebanese delights, all three in number. Fully Loaded Nachos: The quantity has been reduced but the quality remains the same. Cottage Cheese & Capsicum Sizzler: This has always been my favourite, chunks of paneer are tossed in a spicy gravy and goes well with the rice served along. Slices of Zucchini and Bell Papers are left to sizzle. To pacify the heat, french fries are also served. Chicken Baida Roti: Minced Chicken is cooked and stuffed in a dough pocket and then deep fried. Comes with the green apple chutney and is an absolute delish. Iced Teas speaks volume about the place, they are absolutely refreshing. You should definitely order this, served in a little bath tub, these are pleasing to the eyes. Strawberry Cheesecake Shake & Ferrero Rocher Shake are my recommendations. I can easily think of going to this place all alone and spend a few hours. A must-visit! Happy Eating!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Alka Sharma,"Rated 7th Feb 2016- Already been to Odeon Social twice, once on 26th jan 2016-it was completely vacant with just 3-4 tables occupied. Then on my sister's bday on 1st Feb, the taste of the food is same as HKV outlet-hit or miss ! The second time,it was a weekday- few more tables were occupied than the last time. The major Cons that I would point out here is that firstly, the LOUD MUSIC WAS TOO DEAFENING THAT WE COULD HARDLY TALK TO EACHOTHER-by the time, we were out - My voice was already hoarse from shouting. SECONDLY, all the cigarette smoke was entering inside. WE HAD TO SIT, SMOKING PASSIVELY FOR THE ENTIRE DINNER -lasted an hour or more which made the experience horrible for all of us. Same was the story at HKV, it seems that the social management only wants to cater the SMOKERS or promote passive smoking.

Ambiance: This place will remind you of your school,be it the staff dressing, the posters, the human skeleton or the the swings. The seating is not that comfortable though.

The must have's for vegetarians here being, paneer makhni biryani which is out of this world. Another good dish to try out is the Achmed's Mezze Platter, especially the Cheese Awesamosas. The Oreo mud pot shake is also a nice-filling drink to kill your hunger pangs and get yourself on to the dance floor. They have a nice-exhaustive bar right next to the dance floor to keep you going. All-in-all, a highly recommended place, which's value for money, and won't burn a hole in your pocket. The only thing missing is a hukka (sheesha) menu, which would've made this place 'the' place to hit always. But I'm not complaining.",Rated 4.0,6,44,??

Komal Bhatia,"Rated Went there on a Friday night. It started with waiting time of 30 mins. We choose to wait in the Bar section where we had to stand as strangely they don't have chairs near the bar. Major turn off was over loud music which made it impossible for us to talk. Service was under average as the waiters didn't remember what was the order at the time of billing. Also, our seat was allotted to someone else while we were out in the smoking zone. Mismanagement at its height. I guess Haus Khas Social is the way better.",Rated 3.0,5,49,??

Manavv Piplani (Bribing Stomach),"Rated The new social at odeon launch was on the verge and I got a chance to check it out before it opens.The location is amazing and easy to find,the interiors is done on the theme of BackToSchool and social has done complete justice to the theme by keeping it raw as social is known for. So being on exclusive preview we got their recommended dishes, Awesomosa was nice and crisp,fried with mushroom and cheese stuffing,loved it. Chilly chicken nicely cooked chicken presented with chopsuey over it. One of my favourite. Chinese bhel something new as expected, and pleasantly tasty, a must try. Butter chicken Biryani,as the name says interesting and worth giving a shot,you will love it if you are a punjabi Fish tacos,tacos with crumbed fish fingers was finger liking and mouth watering. Chocolate blood bath,this desert belongs to all the chocolate lovers,it is basically mixture of all the chocolate and is quite tasty. Heaven for chocolate loving people. Strawberry ice tea,just out of curiosity I ordered it but was very yummy and I loved the refreshing taste.

Sidhant Ahuja,"Rated Odeon Social is located next to Big Cinemas .The entrance of the place is quite a mystery a lift door opens and then is the old wooden(Back to School) staircase. Occupying the first floor which is further divided in two parts a small rectangular terrace(which can be thought of an activity place as they have swings)and the indoor part. The rustic furniture is reminiscent of the good old school days. They have a wall dedicated to the trophies and the signboard outside the kitchen reads Home Science. On the whole a lot of thought has been given to the interiors of the place. But the food was definitely not upto the mark.Tried the Chili cheese toast.Just an average toast with cheese nothing great about it. Even the Ferrero Rocher shake wasn't good.It was not the regular one which I generally drink at the hkv outlet. Then had the electric blue LIIT which was okay. The awesomoasas were good though,Thin golden brown fried sheets wrapped in cheese and mushrooms this dish was amazing in taste.

The ambience was nice and the ppl(attenders) were full of energy ..some how the food could not leave the mark which the ppl at the SOCIAL did... I ordered a salad ""beetroot and pear salad."" And I could taste the strong endeavour of the chef trying to bring the American flavour on the table but it was a big fail.. It was too sweet. While ordering I thought the salad would be raw like a 'salad' salad, and it was nothing but a complete disappointment ..however I still recommend that one goes to this caf for not just the food but also the lovely ppl who looked like enthusiasts in their endeavour of giving the service everyone expects at a place like this...overall I would suggest be careful with the while you order something new from the menu..

Alisha Beotra,"Rated First things first, or rather, nice things first, this is coming from an ardent Social fan and I absolutely loved the place right from the moment I entered. The staircase, the rules notice right when you climb the stairs, the tables, everyone in school uniforms, the outside space, the swing there - it was all so pleasant and refreshing and so thoughtfully done! I don't want to go too much into the details since you should have some surprise left for your first time too. I went for breakfast and ordered my signature Oreo mud pot shake with Kiran's breakfast I think which consisted of eggs, bacon, pancakes, Oreo 'cookies' and coffee. I've been having the Oreo shake for 1.5 years now and I'm pretty sure that I can make out the difference if it isn't, say, 'authentic' enough. The looks were the same, outstanding as usual, but the consistency wasn't shake-like at all. It was too light for a shake, like Oreo bits mixed in milk handed over with a cute whipped cream topping. I was more excited about breakfast and the whole ambience then to care about this, but maybe I should have. Pancakes were alright, bacon good, the omelette pretty great with an adequate amount of spiciness as I required. What disappointed me was the 10 bucks Oreo pack given as 'oreo cookies'. I'm sorry but please feel free to remove this Oreo 'cookie' thing from the menu because it brings people's hopes high as they imagine some fancy baked Oreo cookie coming their way. Another drawback - the service was tortoise-paced. Overall, what would have been a 4 or a 4.5 has gone down to a mere 3.5 because of my average at best experience. This makes me really sad because of the sheer love I've had for Social and the food and service it's known to provide!",Rated 3.5,57,370,??

Fully Loaded Nachos- Nachos were good. They were baked properly and served with lot of cheese on it and salsa sauce. It was a good one. The Mile High Club Veg Sandwich- This was presented like a tower with one sandwiches over one another. The three sliced sandwich was a really good and tasty sandwich I had after so long. The fries served along with this were crispy and yummy. Penne White Sauce pasta- This pasta was just ok. Didn't liked it much.

And from the beginning, i.e. from the entry till you are out, i was quite confused and somehow didn't get the concept of this place. Whether they have tried doing it indian, global or what. Looking at the place, the staff, the music, here is what was noticed. We entered with a stamp on our wrists saying present ma'am...why? Probably they wanted us to feel we r going back to school. The staff was found wearing winter school dresses. The menu is in the form of tabloids. The staff didn't come to take our order for a while. Finally they came, the order we gave was a wine n margarita Along with fully loaded nachos. The drinks were fine, but nachos were a problem. First of all, the pan looked like the material and colour in jails or sarkari messes. The nachos had all the ingredients but it was served almost like halwa... Sangria was not good. We had to replace it with beer. The so called chakhna came in steel double decked tiffin...which had fryums and murukku..but the waiter was unable to open it himself. Why complicate life, i don't get it. Btw these arrived post our nachos. Then came a mezze platter on copper thaali which served kulchas and not pitA breads along with two pickled cucumbers which were actually those pickled gherkins. I mean making your own nice pickles with carrots radishes is not a big deal at all. The falafel and cheese samosas had too much oil as if fried in cold oil. Right in front of where we sat was a home science door. Right outside that was a skeleton. There was a woman walking around with a lil frown who looked like some principal of school. Right next to that bio lab skeleton was bar on one side and projector screen on the other. We sat on a corner where there was a so called library look alike from schools and a showcase of awards. The music was mere noise. And all this on a friday night. I must say, i was disappointed.",Rated 2.5,97,266,??

What kinda poutine doesn't have gravy and is made with mozzarella and cheddar instead of cheese curds? It's just cheesy fries ffs. Selection of drinks are immense, no worries there.

Jatin Dev,"Rated I went to a very conservative catholic school while growing up so drinking up in its ""back to school"" kinda ambience was an intense experience for me. It has leaderboards, trophies, principal's room, dial up l-telephones and what not to bare the authenticity. Even though our group did not include any ladies, still the manager Mr Anand was kind enough to provide us comfortable seats. Kudos to him for that. Now, I may have become a sucker for cinnamon recently but the Hot Shoddy was spot on with its price, taste and quantity. The blueberry pancakes were light and filling but little too short on the compote. And the bacon in the Saddlebags definitely needs to be crispier. (Otherwise what's the point of its indulgence) The service is quick and the seating is quite spacious. The music is definitely loud here but the tunes are quite swanky to put your nerves at ease. The service and value for money might just set a new standard among its competition.",Rated 4.5,53,152,??
Aditi Malhotra,"Rated I recently visited the Odeon Social and must say was very very impressed with the place. The concept of Back to School, is reflected in each and every element of the restaurant. Some parts give you the feel of that teacher's staff room that we saw in our school times, complete with those big tables, old style phone and even a typewriter. There is a huge show window with trophies and books, a wall that adorns shields, a blackboard to write those interesting 'thoughts of the day', a principal's room, which makes up their storage, because a principal's room is always a restricted area, there is a home science department, which makes up for their kitchen, and a skeletal in showcase welcomes you right in front of this department. There are those long benches, where you can co-work, or just enjoy food and drinks alone or with bunch of your friends. They have a long running bar which allows multiple people to sit across unlike that small canteen window, where we pushed around our friends to get food and drinks. The huge balcony which overlooks the road, also has some seating and a couple of swings to remind you of your school ground, and makes an ideal place for warm winter afternoons and pleasant summer evenings.A lot of boards with names and marks of students adds more value to the ambient feeling of school. They even have a huge school bell, to tell you, when its really the time to go back to home ;). But the best thing is that the theme is not just restricted to decor, but it truly reflects its essence in the menu, the food presentation and taste of the food. They have introduced about 15 exclusive items in the menu which compliment the theme, apart from the regular menu. Vada Pao, Samosas, Bread Pakoras, sound like familiar canteen dishes, isn't it, and they are all part of the menu, but prepared in a much more interesting way, with some twists of tastes. The plates and glasses that they serve in take you back to school in an instant, and they way certain items of the food are presented is so so interesting to look at. So be prepared to get your lunch served in tiffin boxes and enjoy a walk down the memory lane. Even the drinks are served in a very innovative way, with the mocktails served in jars and cocktails served in very tall glasses that remind of test tubes. To start with, we were served with Masala Guava and Pink Cream cocktails, and both of them were excellent, especially the Masala Guava. Unlike the usual guava drinks that are made from the pink guavas and are sweet in taste, this one was from the 'Kachha Green Amrud' that we normally enjoy with some chaat masala, it tasted exactly like that and was yum. For starters, we got to taste their Chilly Chicken and the vegetarian version with Chilly Paneer. The chilly chicken was awesome and done to perfection, the chilly paneer was somewhat more spicy than the chicken, and hence a little too hot to handle. The next was the Vada Pao and I have to say that after Mumbai, it was the best Vada Poa ever. Its very hard to get such an authentic taste in Delhi, but this one truly had that local essence, though the pao that they used was not a typical bun, but a very soft and delicious pita bread, which did complete justice to the softness, the texture and taste of the bread. The most putting off are the pao that we get in Delhi otherwise, but this made an exception. We were also served a non veg version of Vada Pao, which was a chicken pal, and it was also the best ever I had. The chicken was very juicy and tender, and had a very mild yet a very great taste. The dips and accompaniments were great too, especially those fryums that were long forgotten. But the show stopper was the 3 layered dessert. It had layer of soft chocolate cake, topped with vanilla ice cream and a the third layer of chocolate ice cream, a very hot chocolate sauce is then poured on top of it, creating a melting well of ice cream, which is very very tempting to look at and equally awesome to taste.

Avani Gupta,"Rated I'm a big fan of the hauz khas social. So I definitely wanted to try this one. The food was definitely below average. We tried the Mezze platter and it was the worst Mediterranean food I've had. Management was sufficiently apologetic and asked for feedback on the comments card. The thing that put me off was that the chef came out and started arguing with us and insisting that his food was perfect. He has no compulsion to implement our suggestions, but actually coming out and fighting was too much. Definitely not going again.",Rated 2.5,2,104,??

Food was as always LIPSMACKING GOOD! although the cheese burger was a bit disapointing still can't figure out how something good looking can taste that bad (don't take this as a bad remark all their food is good I'm just not much of a salad person ) Staff was very helpful and courteous.. Also the outdoor seating/balcony was good enough to stroll around , it has a swing too Anyways Enjoy the photos",Rated 4.5,12,27,??

Srj,"Rated I have been to all the Social outlets including Odeon Social before, but for some reasons have not even sat down at any of the outlets, and have never had a meal here before. This time thankfully I did get to experience what the brand Social is all about... I Went to Odeon social recently, and quite liked the quirky contemporary yet desi concept which Social is famous for; this Social is nice as well. The inspiration or theme behind this outlet is School. So there are roll of honor boards, trophy walls, staff wearing school uniforms, bells, folk and spoons trays with scales, a huge class poratrait etc which gives a very nice School look yet a contemporary one. The seating is mix of comfy sofas, and class room benches. Bar area looks good as well. Al fresco area is decent too. Food: The Menu is nice and has some interesting options. I tried the samosa combo with chaney, vada pao, and a chinese box meal which had cottage cheese in a gravy with noodles. The samosa combo served in a lunch box was delicious especially the chickpeas served with it. They are a modern version of the matra that we get at the Choley kulche shops. Vada pao was nice in taste but the bread was not that good as it was not the typical bun pao. The dip and fries served with it were good. Cottage cheese Chinese meal box was nicely prepared and tasted fine. I had ordered for the meal with fried rice but the noodles were good too. The dish was not authentic Chinese but a nice Chinjabi version.. Presentation of dishes in tiffins, bill served in tiffin box with damage written on it etc has quirky cool written all over it. Service was really good and the staff was helpful with the order. The music played was good. The place gets really busy on weekends so plan your visit accordingly. Social can be used as a workplace too which is a nice initiative. Odeon Social is now a brand in itself, and is a cool and quirky place which can be visited for sure at anytime of the day. Its concept is good too. The prices are really competitive which gives them a good advantage over other chains in the area.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Manish S  Gulati,"Rated The moment I entered the place I felt nostalgic about my good old school days. Well the whole theme of this outlet is 'back to school' & they have wonderfully executed in thier decor,interiors & food too. The walls were adorned with collections of trophies and cups.lot many posters were hanged also. There was an old typewriter & a telephone also on some tables.They have different seating arrangements be it like classroom chairs or long benches with wooden tables or be it sofas to relax & unwind urself. Everything was just perfect. Well in food I ordered for veg croquettes which had a filling of cheese,potatoes & corns . Which were perfectly made crisp from outside & soft from inside. Totally loved it. I ordered mocktail also named pink cream which was a blend of strawberry syrup orange juice , mango juice & guava juice. It was a complete refresher. I ordered for beer also which was served in the glasses written thandi beer in hindi on it. They also have a terrace area where you can sit & relax over food & drinks.They have two swings also which takes you back to your childhood days. Overall a nice experience with a pleasing ambience.

Not to forget, the interiors will make you call you school friends and ask them to meet you at OdeonSocial to celebrate all these amazing moments of growing up.

Shreya Srivastava,"Rated Having heard a lot about the Social chain of restaurants, I decided to try this newly launched one at C.P. From the outside, it looks quite small and dinghy, but go inside and experience this giant of a restaurant. The place is huge - bigger than Striker's or Cafe Public Connection. The place is divided into three seating areas - two with smoking restrictions and one for the smokers. Each seating area is in itself a restaurant with unique interiors and decor. There are wooden chairs and tables, couches and sofas. The bar counter is enormous and they have a seating area there too. At each table there is a hanging electrical connector where you can plug in your chargers. The cutlery is placed in a steel glass and the napkin is rolled with Social written on it. They are encased in a box made of yellow wooden scales that we used in school. The servers are polite and they are always up at your seat asking you about food and drinks. They are dressed up in school uniform with their sweaters bearing a coat of arms like Hogwarts. We ordered Spaghetti Aglio Oleo with chutney in a tiffin box, Corn Falafel bao with hummus and Classic Long Island Ice tea. Their quirky presentation is enough to drive you crazy. The spaghetti was served in a steel tiffin box - the kind our parents took to school. The L.I.I.T. was served in a 500ml jar that we used in our chemistry lab. You can actually notice how many millilitres you have drunk through this jar. Anyway, getting to the taste of the food. The spaghetti was light and was topped with cheddar cheese, chilli flakes, shredded coconut, mushrooms and juillienes of French beans. The finely chopped garlic had a prominent flavour in this dish. The corn Falafel bao with french fries and hummus was a class apart dish. The Falafel was crispy and the filling of corn was tasty as well as innovative. The buns or the baos were soft and went well with the brittle texture of the Falafel Patty. The bao also had white sauce and cabbage leaves in addition to the Falafel. The hummus had a very fine texture with the flavours of chick peas bursting in my mouth. Their 500ml L.I.I.T. was the best and the strongest I have had so far. It took a good quarter hour to finish it. Highly recommended. The place is good on the pockets too - optimally priced menu and good portions.

Sainyam Kapoor,"Rated i had never been to any social till today, jus heard about different themes that they have for decor. so this one as all others have highlighted, was school. must say it was done pretty well, the furniture and fixtures, a globe on the corner, swings in the outside area, trophies and books caninet, uniform for the servers. would all make you remniscent about your school. it was a short visit and we ordered croquettish and awesomosas and along with them the accompaniments i.e. chilli and mango murabba, sriraja chunda and green apple chutney. croquettish was nice and cheesy and awesomosas was perfectly fried. but the best part were the chutneys, all three were nicely thought of and hugely enhanced the flavour of the snacks. the only thing which made me rate 2.5 was, the plates that they gave to eat food in, it had the small of rotten egg coming through, even though we got the plates replaced, still i could get that same smell. However, would definitely like to go again with more time on hand and more stuff to try, but mayb not eat anything from there plates.",Rated 2.5,20,566,??

Takes you right back to your school days with a School themed furniture and staff dressed in school uniforms (not to forget the big display of St. Marks school :p). The place has a good vibe and was buzzing on sat eve. The service was quick and the staff was courteous although the food was not quite up to the mark. Ordered chinese bhel, chicken tikka tacos and death chicken wings. Comparing with the Hkv social, the food was a bit disappointing. The tacos were good although the portion size was less. Chicken wings were not spicy enough as compared to the reputation they carry. With minor improvements, this place can be one of the best in CP. Overall a decent experience.",Rated 3.5,9,64,??
Shivangi,"Rated It's been such a delight to have Social at CP(Central Location). Though it's nothing in comparison to HKV's Lake view and greenery, but it's based on an entirely different theme : Schooldays. Having wooden seating, reception desk on entrance, typewriters on table, swings and school's board of honour in balcony, service staff in school uniforms with Social monograms, it does complete justice to the theme. You will certainly get a flashback of your school days. We went on a weekday morning, opted for outside seating (Delhi winters) on a comfy, red couch. We ordered : * Oreo Mud Pot : So flavourful,thick and creamy in huge quantity Complete 5/5. * Caffe Latte : bit of disappointment here. Really average. 3/5 * Mile High Sandwich : 3 Layer Sandwich with veggies, cheese and soft patty accompanied with fries and dip. It was huge and delicious but what was the outstanding part of the dish were the fries, probably the best I ever had. So crispy and crunchy. 5/5 for them. *Service was warm and welcoming.

The toxic LIIT was on point, the Schezwan chicken was a tad bit too spicy, the Barbecue platter and Ferrero Rocher Shake were nice. Extra points for the hipster decor and utilising space well (the HKV social gets too stuffy, which I didn't think was a problem here even later in the night when it was teeming with guests). We asked for terrace seats - which they said wasn't available, although when I stepped out there in fact was space, so we shifted. It wasn't much of a hassle.",Rated 4.5,6,6,??

The chinese bhel was good too, But I personally loved the mezze platter more. They had dips and pita, falafel, something cheesy and certain crispy chips like thing. Totally worth the price.

Sanju Aneja,"Rated #Odeon_Social - A QUIRKY SCHOOL THEMED RESTAURANT THAT SHARES A WORKPLACE AS WELL #SOCIALOFFLINE has come up with it's third venture at CP and this time it is banking on the ""BACK TO SCHOOL"" theme. Everything about the place will make you feel nostalgic. The wall adorning honor rolls, shields and a class group picture, wooden shelves crammed with old books, a typewriter and phone set of the bygone days and waiters clad in school uniform, all will bring back memories of good old school time. And the best part, they have a work space as well for people who love to work with loud music and great food. They share the same menu as the other two outlets that serve comfort food from different cusines, for every genre. Here, the added advantage is that it serves the Social chhath menu as well. Their bar counter serves abundant variety of drinks that one can enjoy with some lip smacking snacks. I've tried almost everything from their menu at the other two outlets, so this time I went with the theme and ordered 'SAMOSE WITH CHHOLE' to start my meal. Two adequately big sized samosas were served with black gram, freshly prepared samosa tasted good as you don't expect good samosa at such cafes or restaurant. Not a bad deal at Rs. 90 to revisit my canteen days. I satiated my sweet taste buds with their signature OREO MUD PIE SHAKE (Rs.190/+taxes), it was thick and outstanding as usual. CHILLI AND BLACK PEPPER CHICKEN BAO (Rs.210/+taxes) - the soft bao was sufficiently stuffed with spicy shredded chicken, if you want to add some more spice to it, you can dip it into schezwan sauce that was served with it. In a nutshell, apart from good food and reasonably priced drinks, Social packs plenty of charm. Service was prompt. Total bill costed Rs. 638/- and my belly was pack to the fullest.",Rated 4.0,60,575,??

Neelaakshi Piplani,"Rated After having a horrible food experience in Def Col Social, i was skeptical to try this new Social Venture, but as soon as i Stepped in the premises of the outlet, I knew I was up for something Big and Exciting, the entry from ""lift door"" which instead deceives you to a huge staircase, which was sort of unusual and different. The back to school theme was completely justified by the restaurant's decor and had a ""social's touch"" as the ambiance was raw and very comforting. What to Munch? Hot Tennessee wings-which was juicy and were presented with some onion rings and had a little sweet taste. Awesamosa-filled with jalapeo cheese, deep fried and tasty samosa . Chinese Bhel-It's a win!! You won't realize where it vanished when served on your table. Must Try! Butter chicken Bao-Show stopper dish. The regular butter chicken tasted fab filled in pita bread. WOW Butter chicken biryani-I sound like a butter chicken fan and hell I am! And you will be if you try this. Butter chicken covered with rice and presented in pan with some fryums. What to Slurp? Game of sling- My favorite from their widespread cocktail menu. It was a gin based drink, presented in a sling stand with a #DRNK napkin Cosmo Explosion- Candy floss presented in a cocktail glass, poured with the cranberry vodka mix on top of it with a lemon wedge lit over it. Loved the taste as well as the presentation. For Desert we had Bannofie Cronut- The best presented dish with the worst taste. Too hard to cut. There was a stark oil you could feel as soon as you bite in. This dish needs improvement and attention big time!! Chocolate bath-Compensation for the horrible bannofie Cronut we had. Best for chocolate lovers as it was a mix of all sort of chocolates/brownies with ice cream. The service and the servers deserve a mention. It was pretty smooth.

Poorvi Singh Chaudhary,"Rated I visited this place on the 13th for the preview night, an event hosted by the social for bloggers to introduce the newest member of the social offline family! The theme of this place is ""back to school"" and is executed very well. From the school uniform drawn by the waiters and the decor of the place compromising of all the things that takes you back to your school days, such as the trophy displays, the benches, home science lab and completed with the class photographs! Coming to the food, we ordered Sangria, cosmopolitan, corona, Oreo mud shake, Meatballs, Shawarma and Chocolate blood bath. Out of all the things the dessert was the best and followed by the shawarma and Oreo mud shake. What I didn't like were the meatballs It is definitely a go-to place mainly because of the ambience. Talking about the service of the place, earlier because of the commotion the servers were making many mistakes, but eventually, they got a hang of it and it was good",Rated 4.5,27,34,??

We ordered Thai Thalli which is best thai food i have tried in India and it reminded me of meal i had in thai village back in 2011 which is very good . we also ordered Tikka Tacos which was good but not at good as thai thalli. In Drinks we ordered Homemade lemonade (Salty) which was not very good .

Shalini Srivastava,"Rated Was there for a quick bite last week. Liked the back to school themed interiors! Social offline is known for its quirky and out of the box approach. We tried Awesamosa which were crispy and delicious , Tennessee chicken wings were a bit too sweet. Chilli chicken was tasty , naga chilli cheese toasts were slightly chewy but good, I liked the butter chicken biriyani which was nothing but rice layered over butter chicken. China box was good with cottage cheese variant. In desserts only chocolate blood bath was good , the banoffee cronut was so chewy, oily and hard to cut into .. Complete downer!

Sayali Goyal,Rated The concept and going back to school is interesting and will make people atleast go once. But its the food the brings people back. Such few options for vegeterians. Also food is below average. Banofee pie was super sweet and sticky almost not chewable and tasted a bit like malpua. I had to leave most of it.

MOVISH,"Rated Hats off to whoever thought and pulled off a theme so close to every grownup's heart...one's school days.Right from the entrance at Odeon Cinema (Social occupies the 1st floor)where you are marked with a stamp that says ""May I come in Mam?"" you are excited at the prospect of discovering what lies ahead.... You aren't disappointed. The place has a seriously high cool quotient or should I say high school quotient ;) It's large space is filled with all the elements reminiscent of our school days....a wall covered with shields n trophies, another covered with a mammoth blow up of a class photograph,yet another has a stack of lockers.The place is replete with classroom style furniture, typewriters, globes, chartpapers ,a Roll of Honor and sundry other knick knacks. Thoroughly enjoyed exploring its AMBIENCE which even boasts of a PRINCIPAL 's room and a Biology and a Chemistry lab like setup.Even the servers were dressed in school uniforms with a monogrammed sweater. Such great attention to detail !! The jail style crockery and the cutlery stand with its printed roll of napkin remained quintessentially SOCIAL.The foot tapping music adds to the mood of the place which is very very vibrant.A full 5/5 for the AMBIENCE. We ORDERED an Achmeds Mezze Platter ... the Falafels were scrumptious, the cheese Awesamosas were very oily ,the dips were average. The Pita was simply perfect. The Shawarma with its roasted chicken ,hummus and salad was good. The egg in the Anda Shammi Pao took away from the taste of the delicious Shammi n Pao combo.Wouldn't be a bad idea to do away with the egg altogether.The accompanying green chutney was so rich and balanced in flavors that I wiped the tiny bowl clean with a bit of Pao. I found the Chilli Paneer Black Pepper China Box to be an amazing concept, with great spicy n chilly hot taste.Sadly,the quality of Paneer and Rice needs to be improved for the dish to really make an impression. I had a glass of Shiraz and a Mangorita ,which was good with a coupling of tequila and raw mango flavours with a hint of ginger n basil.The food was a 3/5 for me on the whole. The SERVICE here has truly raised the bar for me.The staff is quick,friendly,hospitable and extremely polite.I was really impressed with the service aptitude of the staff.My request for a charger was met with great enterprise on the staff's part who cajoled guests on another table to part with their charger on their reassurance.... Full marks again...5/5. I would certainly recommend the Odeon Social to have a great time with friends and family at prices that don't pinch you too much.I ll be revisiting to try more of their food after a month.Hopefully, they would have found their bearings by then.Till then its a 4/5 on the MOVILICIOUS METRE.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

I liked the school theme, and for sure my school days weren't as happening as OdeonSocial, so i just loved it. We ordered a Long Island Ice Tea, Smirnoff, Beer and Social Chakhna Tiffin. Social Chakhna Tiffin had many options, and you can choose any two for just Rs. 90/-. We ordered Masala peanuts and Muruku. The quality of chakhna was great. The chakhna was served in a school tiffin, well presented. The Long Island Ice Tea was a bit diluted though. Not sure if it is clear in the photos, the entry stamp was ""Please Mam, May i come'in Mam?"" Ambience was great. The washroom had that school charts showing alphabets, good/bad manners, photo attached. The wooden chairs facing a couched sofa, reminded me of a principal room. VirDas gave a live performance.

Manish Mohan,"Rated The opening day it was. And yeah the good old days of the school were reminded as the theme of ""back to school"" was very well obeyed. Ambiance- The seats were in the form of wooden benches. The menu was written in an attendance register. The spoon set was kept in a ruler pencil box. The waiters were wearing a uniform of odeon sr. Sec. School. The kitchen was named as home science lab. Food talks- We ordered the paneer china box and oreo mudpot shake. Paneer china box- This was sonething unique which i ever had. The chilly paneer in the gravy came very good with the noodles. Topped up was some crisp blisters of chowmein, which were giving it a crisp bite. But the noodles the paneer gravy came out very well. Oreo mudpot shake- Chilled as a frost bite, serving of the shake was a masterpiece. The shake served in a plastic mudpot topped up with powdered oreo biscuit gave the feel of mud on top of the mudpot. The whipped cream and the oreo cream layer below the biscuit layer can make anyone go mmmmmm....... An experience totally different.

Ridhi Arora,"Rated Delhi gets another Social. This time the theme is Back to School. And truly the ambience matches up to the theme perfectly...starting from the kitchen called the ""principal room"", the wall which has a blow out of a school class photograph, the table which has pencil and ruler and those charts which we all used to buy from the stationery shop, the chairs which look like you are in school, the servers who are wearing school uniform, and the menu which looks like a binded school book. The ambience has definitely been well thought of. However, it's the service and the food which really ruined my experience here. Social has such small portion of everything they serve! Also the staff took way to long to get our order and looked least bothered. We ordered- Keema Pav (tasty) Sandwich Bombay bachelors - really not sure what was the intent behind this dish, bread filled with cucumber and some weird stuff - did not like Grilled chicken Peri sizzler - again not worth the price, 450 for 2 small piece of chicken served with a peanut amount of rice and fries Mac and cheese - such a let down Drinks - beer and sangria pitcher (sadly they did not offer pitcher for beer) Overall I would only like to visit this place for its ambience (because who doesn't want to relive their school days) .

Abhiram Dileep,"Rated Being a huge fan of their hkv outlet I rushed to cp on Friday for their opening. I should say they didn't live upto my expectations. They had a lift door that opens to a staircase which was a nice touch in my opinion and I personally liked the interior at first glance. The whole school theme and everything seemed interesting at first but my opinion began to change as we took seat at one of the tables. The anthropometry was horrible. The first table we sat at was too low and you gotta be good at gymnastics if you really wanted to share a platter your friend across the table. We ordered a grilled sausage sharing plate, jalapeo Mac and cheese, honey chilly potatoes and a couple of drinks. Their service was pretty slow, probably cuz they just opened but that's no excuse for taking 15 minutes to bring a bottle of beer, is it? Food was fine and tasted just like the hkv social. Oh and they got rid of the news paper menus that we all love and got these text book menus to go with their theme. I personally didn't like it and they were already tearing apart although it was their first day. Hope you guys improve seating. Even if it's gotta go with your school theme just make sure that it meets basic requirements of comfort and usability.",Rated 3.0,18,65,??
Nitika Bhatia,"Rated Visited Odeon Social which has launched very recently in CP for a preview with a friend. I am a fan of their Hauz Khas restt and was really looking forward to try the new place which has opened in the heart of Delhi. The #Backtoschool concept very nicely reflects at this place- beginning from their gated entrance (like that of a school), to the Principal-Student style desk and chair setup, to elements like Home Science lab, principal room, Swings and much more. Must say they have lived up to my expectations of keeping the interiors true to the theme. Also, this outlet is very spacious as compared to the HKV one. Coming to the menu, it is more or less similar to the one in HKV. The presentation of dishes and drinks is really good, but somehow I think the taste didn't match up to the food at HKV. My favourite from their menu was Veg Croquettes, Veg China box and stuffed Nachos. In drinks I loved their Tropical Rum. Rest, I did try many non veg dishes like Fish and chips, Chicken tacos, prawns and more, but well they were quite average. If you are missing your school time, then you must hit this cool place with your friends for an amazing experience.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The amazing launch of this place is something which has created the history for me. more than 500 people inside the place, no place to walk or stand and forget the tables. But still the excitement it pumps in was superb. more than anything else i think it was the music which caused the adrenaline rush and also lead to the superb night on a weekday. LIIT and shots are just amazing and they truly deserve a mention in this review. although i didnt have much of the food, but whatever was served was very nice and amazing.

Parvinder Singh Kalsi,"Rated Connaught Place - the heart of Delhi, has seen a lot of newly launched bars, lounges, cafes and restaurants recently. And when you thought CPs got everything to play with your senses, here comes Social- the big daddy of all! Located right above the Odeon Cinema, one cannot walk past this lane and not notice the huge board that lights up the ""Odeon Social"". Reaching here isnt difficult too. Get to Rajeev Chowk Metro and take the exit at Gate No 3. Take a Right and walk 150 m on Ring Road no 5. I was lucky enough to be a part of the launch party. After confirming my name on the list, I was inked with a rubber stamp that read, PRESENT MADAM! (How cool?!) We were then given badges that would divide us into one of the four houses. The flight of stairs led me to a podium where I was given a pack of cotton candy and a drink in colourful water bottle! Based on a school theme, this place is done exceptionally well with the waiters and bartenders wearing school uniforms, chalk boards, drawings and posters on the wall, typewriter and telephones of the by-gone age, trophies and awards in a cabinet, shields on the wall, a board displaying names of outstanding performers, an entire wall with a class photograph, charts depicting animals, fruits & vegetables, long tables and wobbly chairs! Since it was the launch party, the kitchen and the bar werent fully functional. So we got our hands on some Double Grilled Naga Chilli Cheese Toast, Jalapeno Cheese Nad served along with Schezwan, Tikki Chaat, Sri Raja Paneer Chilli. All of these were presented well and surely hit the right notes! There were not many options in mocktails so I had to settle down for juices! Sadly, I couldnt try much from the menu. Will definitely go back again! Paaji Says: Dont miss out on the talk of the town that will bring forth glimpses of the past.

Now while walking around the lanes of Connaught Place with friends, you'll find a place named #OdeonSocial a warm & fuzzy reminder of our childhood days at school. Stepping into this Social outlet will make you feel like youve taken a time machine back into a school from the past. Just like old days, as soon as you are admitted into this school you'll be divided into different houses. On the entrance, you'll find a flight of stairs taking you up to your classrooms. Was served with a complementary cocktail drink in a cute water bottle. With chalkboards, desks, class photograph, trophies, shields, leader-board, rotary dial telephones, cutlery presented in a box made up of scales, wobbly chairs all around and rooms named as Principal's room, home science room, no admission etc will just remind you of own school. Drinks are available in variety including shots, gotis, lits, cocktails, malts etc and presented well too. But goes opposite when it comes to mocktails. Finger snacks were well prepared, fresh, clean and quick served too. I tried alepino cheesy balls, naga chilly toast, dal pakwan, chilly paneer none of them disappointed. With decor that whisks you away to a different world, making you leave all your worries behind and enjoy a good meal that is worth every rupee that you pay for it.

Rishika Kumar (missfoodiediaries),"Rated In my latest venture, i had gone to ODEON SOCIAL. They have this impressive concept of BACK TO SCHOOL and they've depicted it quiet well through their wall hangings and decor. The moment you enter, the staircase makes you feel like you are back to school and ready to see some uniforms and school bags. Was really impressed with the execution of this concept. The restaurant is huge and spacious and they've also got a long balcony where you can sit and enjoy the view, especially in the evening. They have a giant 42 feet bar which serves many cocktails and mocktails. I will give full marks to the designer for making sure to put everything on the right place so that this entire restaurant justifies the concept of Back To School. They had telephones, typewriters, quirky drawing like the ones we had in our books and swing and an entire wall with a class group photo *memories* If you go to this place you will realise that everything you see will attract you and you will be fascinated by each and every object that they have displayed. Coming to food, Odeon Social serves somewhat the same food like the other two outlets in Delhi. The food is delicious and they've maintained thier standards very well. I am a big fan of social offline, HKV and so I was expecting too much from this one too. These guys payed equal attention to the food like they did for the decor. Special Mention to Mr. Neeranjan Sharma, FnB executive of Odeon Social who served me with delectable food and explained me the concept behind every dish and even taught me to click pictures of the sizzler. He is the man with a wide smile and a really different accent. Not just Mr. Neeranjan but all the other members of the staff was aware about the dishes they served. The food was fresh, clean and the service was quick My favorite dishes were the chilli chicken, Tennessee chicken wings, chicken biryani and their non-veg sizzler. Sipped some Erdinger because you can hve beer the entire year *rhymes* I ended my food journey with two of my favorite desserts Blood Bath and Layer cake. I dont really have to elaborate on these because the name says it all. Heavenly desserts that will not let you stop till you finish them completely. *drooolinnnggg* HIGHLIGHT OF THE ENTIRE LUNCH LIITs These Long Island Ice Teas are bozzy and gets you trippy but they taste nothing like alcohol. This one had gin, cranberry, rum and what not and it tasted so good that I could not get enough of these. I wish all the best to Odeon Social and I will be a regular customer here because oh well I loved it alot. CHEERS",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Sinchita Kar,"Rated I was lucky enough to get the invite for Odeon Social's launch party. I have to admit it was an awesome event! The theme ""back to school"" is innovative and bring back the Childness in us. Situated right above the Odeon cinema, it has strategically chosen the best place which will attract lots of young crowd. Later, I got to know that yesterday the kitchen was not fully functional. Due to which, they were serving drinks and finger foods only. When we entered the stamp had ""present ma'am"" written over it. Yes! You guessed it right! It was ""back to school"" theme and we were informed to wear black and white preferably for the launch! The AMBIENCE has perfectly depicted the school ambience right from the entrance stairs to the couches and the long cupboards with awards. They also have sitting tables that are similar to the principal's table with phone on one side and the typewriter on the other! The 42 feet long bar is the star! The terrace overlooking CP makes up and amazing place to chill with friends during evenings! For drinks, we tried 6 different types of shots: kala khatta, mango flavoured, strawberry and rose flavoured, ""dawai daru"" based on anis, tequila and vodka. The drinks range are extensive!! It establishes itself as one of the most amazing party places in CP right above odeon cinema! The finger foods were nice and tasty as well. I tried their vada Pao, chilly paneer and pork belly!

Yesterday, I was at the preview of #OdeonSocial which is opening up at Connaught Place. The entry of the place impressed me at first. Just when I stepped in thinking that it's a lift behind the doors there were a flight of stairs taking you up to the main area. Compared to all the other socials in Delhi, this was is huge in size and the theme is #BackToSchool, so everything here will remind you of school and you'll end up discussing your school life with your buds! Nostalgic much, already?! The bar is huge and the size of this Social reminds me of the one they have at Todi Mills in Lower Parel, Mumbai. From the principal's room, home science room, old typewriters, swings, principals chair, big school photographs in black and white, A-Z sheets for fruits, vegetables and animals et al this place screams school! Kudos to the person who has done the interiors of this place, definitely gave it a think and more! It's something different and unlike every other social in Delhi and Bombay. Their food has always been good, so they are living up to that here too. I spotted some new coloured LIITs on the neighbouring table though and it looked really good!
