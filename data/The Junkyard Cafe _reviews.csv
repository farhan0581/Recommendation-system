Ayushie Mathur,"Rated What do I say about this place? First of all, it's huge. It has very creative interiors using all recycled material right from old glass bottles to tyres to metal bearings. What's better? They serve hookah with a massive variety of flavours. Their menu is divided into healthy food options and indulging food options both with lip smacking food. Yes though, this place is a bit expensive which it owes to it's location and wonderful interiors. We tried chicken steak, chilli chicken with fried rice and penne arabiatta at the cafe.",Rated 5.0,7,111,??
Dr Ashwani Mehta,Rated Situated in the outer circle of CP in N block on the second floor is junk yard cafe. Landed there at lunch time. Huge place nicely done up. Bright vibrant colours with patch work sofas. Nice huge bar. I loved the ambience and the work man suits the waiters wore in mustard colour the restaurent gave a feel that I was going to have a great time. Down hill it went like a plane without engines as soon I started ordering. Little informed service staff was a red flag. Indicated no training. Not all bar items were available. Ordered Falafel with pita Junk yard special veg burger Where falafel should have been light/herbaceous/ flavoured with spices it was dense tasteless and hard. Pita was like a thin chapati with flour literally falling from it when we picked it up. The burger had under-spiced pasty patty and mouth feel was gooey. Service staff inattentive. With such high rating on zomato some times one wonders where I go wrong in not finding the right food to order.,Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Nirvan Rustagi,"Rated Very nicely done interiors coupled with good service, its a nice place to spend your weekend. Food is pretty nice, drinks are average Ordered LIIT bucket (literally bucket) Sangria (found it a bit sweet, was redone perfectly) Edison bulb cocktail (within bulb shell with some dry ice magic) Skeleton 3 (served in a plastic skull, flavoured as mentioned) For food, they have an extensive menu Mezze platter ( really nice , and the best part was cheese pita) Lamb dollops (amazing meat balls with cheese) Bieging chicken ( more like salt n pepper chicken) Food was really nice, but nothing spectacular",Rated 3.5,24,93,??
Saurabh Asthana,"Rated While I didn't absolutely love the food here, I had to bump this up to a 4 star from a 3 star review for the outstanding customer service! I ordered the chilli chicken here and I guess it took a little longer than usual to make but the gentleman working here apologized for the wait time.The food was pretty good but nothing too special in my opinion.",Rated 4.0,10,82,??
Saransh Singhal,"Rated After a detailed overview of 4-5 restaurants, we decided to visit this place as the place is really big and serves some delicious momos I have heard of. The management has actually used the word JUNKYARD with the ambience of the restaurant very accurately and beautifully. Big nice custom made sofas and furniture. We ordered a hukka, Honey chilly potatoes, smoked cheese balls, Chicken shish taouk (Recommended by server), chicken & chive dim sums, Junkyard special veg burger, cheese Garlic bread, a minto plus fresh fruit concoction and a mojito. Hukka: They have some really cool big giant hukka's. Can you imagine, it lasted for 3 lonnng hours and that too without any hassle. Thick smoke with smoothness at its best. Honey Chilly potato & Cheese balls: Honey chilly potatoes were crisp-skinned and hot. Light, yummy, sweet and crunchy with the right balance of spices and honey. Smoked cheese balls along with white cheese sauce were a delight to eat. It was delicious and quite filling. Dimsums: They came in a bamboo steam box covered with 5 different sauce. The first bite took me into my deep little corner of savouriness. It was piping hot, filled with juices and the homemade sweet chilli just added a cherry on it. They just made me go 'mmmm'. Chicken shish taouk & cheese garlic bread: I cannot remember the last time I had such dry brittle chewy chicken in a nice place like this. Maybe it was brushed with an egg as I could smell egg and it was like eating a unseasoned omelette. The cheese garlic bread was crisp and was brushed with butter but without cheese, it felt incomplete. junkyard special veg burger & mocktails: It came with a lip-smacking white sauce which enhanced the flavour of the burger. All together it was satisfying. Mojito was flavourless and flat, but the minto plus was the winner among two. Watermelon intensified its awesome sweetness and flavour. Lastly: You can count on them if you want to try something new and you don't have to listen to the phrase 'sorry sir, right now we don't have this'. If you love hukka and momos, then you can easily bet on this place. Price is normal if you compare with other restaurants around here. mytummygrows.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Chris Perkins,"Rated This place is awesome. Great food, great service. The best food we've had in Delhi. The lal maass was brilliant. The entrance from the street is a little hard to locate but worth the effort. (Look for the small sign by the lift). Quirky well finished interior, super friendly, non-pushy staff and a manager, Mr Nitin Jayant who ensures you have a great experience. We had starters, mains, desserts and coffee, beer and cocktails (get the Edison bulb worth the presentation as well as taste). This place is a franchise waiting to happen and if it's kept in India, the rest of the world will sorley miss out.

I preferred indoors....the interiors are completely made of junk things...tyres,beer bottles,silencer and plenty of other things...its a big place..I mean at least 100-125 people can be seated indoors only...but there was something wrong in this place....either it was too bright...or the music played was not matching the ambience of this place...coming to the food...only one word...perfecto...chicken tikka..peri peri pizza...chilly chckn...no complaints...

Mahak Fazli,"Rated We went to this place to have a team gathering so we availed buffet service here. We got a pretty variety of dishes but not all of them tasted good. Well, we got crispy fried veggies(v good) , veg spring roll(average), veg kebab(not good) , veg pizza(good) in veg starters and in non veg starters i liked seekh kebab and pizza and chiken tikka were decent, we were served peanut chiken,well I am not a peanut fan so I didn't like it but others liked it. Then mains,well all i can say is paneer and lal maas tasted v good. Now about dj, initially, he was playing regular cafe muaic in low volume but after we and few other guests requested him and management, he really pumped up the beat and party started and we all enjoyed prety well. All in all it was a good experience. Hookas were decent.",Rated 3.5,15,54,??
Nishit Kp,Rated A dissapointing lunch was what we experienced at this cafe. The theme/decor is nice and the food was good BUT when it comes to the service this place really sucks. We ordered some simple drinks and after like half an hour we asked the server whats the holdup and he casually mentioned that this is how long it takes to get the drinks ! The place was not even full mind you. The Hukaah had to be changed 4-5 times before they got it right. Also the only time a server came to us was to suggest a refill otherwise we literally had to shout to get their attention. They really need to improve on this part.,Rated 2.5,4,22,??
Vasundhra Gupta,"Rated One of the most disappointing experiences ever (and I've had my fair share). Other than the ambiance, I have nothing nice to say about the place. Why? 1. Right off the bat, the washrooms were without water in the taps. In the middle of the day, at the peak lunch hour, where your restaurant is functional and people are coming in, you'd expect that this issue would be attended swiftly. Till the end of my time there, the situation remained the same with the staff who simply nodded and walked off. 2. Having ordered a basic falafel and pita platter, and paying 800 bucks after tax, you could expect the food to have been phenomenal. And yet, here we were, sitting in utter shock and disappointment from the average taste and small quantity. 3. We ordered the peanut butter shake and peach iced tea - both which were HORRIBLE. I am not exaggerating. We took a sip, and asked the steward to take the drinks away, as we will not entertain this any longer. We cancelled the rest of our order, paid for the Falafel platter and left. All in all, a very short and unmemorable experience which leads me to say that I will not be returning to the place, and will not recommend the same to anyone. 2/5 goes only the ambiance of the place.",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Lovely place to be for a brunch or an evening out. We ordered Grilled Chicken and Spinach Salad with Pineapple Dressing, A Peri Peri Pizza, and a Butterscotch Cold Coffee. The salad was cold and great, and had chunky pieces of chicken. The Peri Peri Pizza was delicious. The chicken on the pizza tasted fantastic, and the pizza itself was very cheesy. The Butterscotch cold coffee was lip smacking, frothy, and sweet. Overall, had an amazing time. Would love to visit again. Decor - 5/5 Food - 5/5 Budget - 4/5 Ambiance - 5/5",Rated 4.5,6,35,??

Gayatri Mohan,"Rated Huge place with ample seating, both indoor and outdoor. Classic old school American pub with loud music (mostly pop and soft rock), wooden everything and a lot of cool knick knacks to gawk at (The Mona Lisa in particular). They let us smoke sheesha indoors which was convenient for us. The finger food and drinks in general were great. Nothing we ordered was disappointing. The Nachos need to be tried.

Bedo Dutta,"Rated Well, what a place... The ambience, be it rooftop or the indoor one, is brilliant and creatively made of *Dramatic Music* 'you got it' *snare drums* ""JUNK""... Tada... The waiters are well behaved and the services are fairly good enough. Prices are neither way too high nor too low and the food is value for money. Their menu is creative and divided on the basis of calories. Will recommend JimBeam. And for food try Lamb Seekh Kebabs, Fish and Chips and Chicken Steak. As for Non Alcoholic drinks, Try Hot Choclate Brownie. Loved the place. Keep up the good job.",Rated 4.5,7,55,??
Akshat Kalra,"Rated So I bumped on to this place by accident. I was looking for The Townhouse Cafe and saw this Cafe. Man it was a great decision. Super amazing music played by the DJ on a chilly Friday night. Food - I drank too much that night and just had a white sauce spaghetti pasta.

Tushar Dunga,Rated The junkyard cafe people are really annoying and provide false commitment.I went there yesterday with my friends(12 in total) after booking the reservation with one of their managers over the phone.I specifically asked them if they have a DJ night and the manager confirmed stating that DJ is available on all 7 days and we have Bollywood night today.When we checked in to the cafe while placing the order we again checked with the boy who was taking our order regarding the DJ and the order taker also confirmed that DJ will start at 7:30 PM so we placed our order. After an hour we again asked one of their managers to confirm when will the DJ starts and they confirmed that it will start at 9:30.We waited patiently hoping that we will get some music and when we confirmed with them again at 9:30 PM there manager told us that on Sunday's they don't play loud music and we all were so disappointed to hear that.I have their recordings where their manager where they have confirmed that it is Bollywood night which was not the case.After fighting for more than an hour they decided to give is 15% of discount which was of no use so we decided to pay the bill and move to Townhouse Cafe which is on the first floor of the same building.I would request all of you not to visit Junkyard as they make false commitments and they deny from their statements on your face.Townhouse cafe on the other hand is an excellent place as i called them as well and they denied in the first go that they have live band which was the case.We enjoyed every bit of our time at townhouse cafe.I have already shared the same with my friends and have asked not to go to Junkyard as its a stupid place.,Rated 1.0,1,4,??
Suhael Buttan,"Rated The junkyard cafe has a pretty unique concept with the interiors made of junk and antiques which gives the place a different yet attractive look. They have a nice and decent sized outdoor seating too. The music is always pretty good and a nice mix of genres is played. Coming to the food , I've mainly tried their finger foods like French fries , chips and dip, nachos and wedges which were nicely done but they can increase the quantity. Coming to the non veg section , their chilly chicken and chicken tikka is quite nice. The pieces are tender and juicy with the right balance of spices. As far as drinks are concerned, the rates are reasonable if you go for combos and their cocktails are quite decent too. I feel they can still reduce the prices of the shots they offer for a jger bomb is a tad expensive when compared to other cafes in the neighbourhood. The place is jam packed on weekends. So a reservation is a must. Will definitely be visiting again!",Rated 4.0,29,128,??

Mr. Umang Tewarihas done a superb job in educating delhi. It stands out in every way possible and the brand is unerring with its approach and using it in various verticals from cocktails to food platter. This place is visit and pocket friendly, They've got good nights lined up The drawbacks of this place is that the staff has a laid back attitude.

Sanchi Soota,"Rated The outdoor seating at junkyard is a nice place to be on a winter afternoon. The interiors are really well done too but we chose to sit outside. The menu is artistically planned, considering a variety of options for the health geeks specifically mentioning the calories in each item. We were really in a mood for pizza so we ordered a lamb seekh pizza which was good, but a little oily. They have a preperation of fresh healthy juices from watermelon to beetroot with a twist. These were a good try. The watermelon one had Ming and kafir lime and was very refreshing.",Rated 4.0,14,129,??
Girish Kumar,"Rated The ambience and decor clearly justifies its name ""Junky"".Situated at the second floor in outer circle opposite KG marg. You have two option here either you can sit outside or inside. The interiors were very unique like the name suggests it was giving a feel of junkyard but not in the bad sense. There was also an old plane hanging on the roof near bar. And the bar area was amazing. Edison bulb and Graveyard Cocktails served in a tungsten bulb and a skeleton head shaped glasses respectively. But what stole our hearts was the hookah.. Flavored hookah and it was one if the best and smoothest hookahs I've ever had. It was like hitting the right spot. The perfect hit. Talking about the food..... When it comes to food, we ordered a Smoked Chicken Caesar Salad, Grilled Chicken Breast with Couscous and Healthy Fish & prawns . The salad was good with fresh lettuce, large chunks of smoked chicken and nice cheese shavings. The healthy version of the fish (only 373 calories, claims the menu card). The Grilled Chicken Breast was served with a small portion of Couscous (good), a tangy and spicy red sauce and grilled vegetables. The chicken breast was fibrous and so were the vegetables served with it. Prawns were really good..Prawns were crispy n properly cooked. The staff is very courteous too.They wear orange colour dress and it looks very cool.. Thumbs up for this place.Will be visiting again soon . Keep it up guys!

Priyanshu Kumar,"Rated The Junkyard Cafe - the name itself gives you the very first idea to of the place. It is a concept restaurant which has got nice curated junk artifacts, decors, seatings everything made out of different junk and waste materials. The place is one of its kind and unique in everything . The place has got some reall great art pieces installed all around the place - 8000 beer pint bottles placed on the ceiling to start with, then comes the transformers robot, old transistors, sound sytems, signages etc. The place has got seating carved out of a car, big drums etc. The place has got nice lovely decor and dimmed lighting. The menu is vast and varied. you get all kind of cuisines with a few dishes mentioning calories stats for all health lovers. Now coming on to their food and drinks - I had a few cocktails and mocktails, which were all great at taste. Some great and must have here are - Bourbon Wreckage Fluid, Floral salvage fluid - both are served in unique bamboo cans. Edison bulb 1 uniquely presented with nice gaseous flow and great at taste. Skeleton 1 is great at presentation, served in skull shaped bottle, hard in nature, perfect at taste. In non alcoholic beverages one should go for - Watermelon, Pomegranate, Beetroot and Sweet lime - all were great at taste and refreshing in nature. food- I tried Fish and chips with tartare sauce, Pailard of chicken with lemon and herbs, bhatti ka murg tikka, lamb seekh kebab, prawn salt and pepper, sichuan chicken dimsum, chicken and chive dimsum were great and awesome at taste. Perfectly cooked, properly presented. Loved everything 1 Asparagus and black fungus dimsum wasnt that great....smoked chicken pepper was crunchy, cpould have been juicier for a better experience. Desserts - White chocolate Raspeberry truffle and Nutella Cheesecake were awesome at taste and must have here. The Brainfreezer Sheesha here is a must have. Smooth and great.

Pradeep Chamaria,"Rated Junkyard Cafe is a first of kind concept in Delhi. The place interiors is made of all Junk and food derives an inspiration from Health food. It was like visiting my favourite place on the earth a Junkyard/scrap dealers joint. Yes, you guessed it right, I am an avid scrap lover. Being a metallurgist, steel and copper scraps are my favourites, and a lot of my antique cameras were sourced from the Sunday Flea market in Delhi. The Rock Gardens in Chandigarh had always been my choicest haunts in India, but now I guess the Junkyard caf can replace it. Being in the same town as I live in, I dont have to make special arrangements to visit make like for Rock Gardens. In fact this is only the second place on this earth that I have come across which has given new dimensions even to scraps. And the amazing food they serve here is always a plus point. A lot has been talked about the dcor and the ambiance, so I guess I wont talk much about it in my blog. But still a little information is needed what say folks? Junkyard has recycled scrap all around, though very wisely arranged to create the greatest of great ambiance. It also has an outer sitting area which gives you the feel of the rooftop ambiance. The empty beer bottles used as ceilings at a sitting area, the discarded PCB used on Table top, a plane made out of scrap, vintage cheese graters, old buckets, old worn out tyres, empty oil drums, the sofas made of mother boards, Car bonnets, a Monalisa painting made entirely of Junk, a transformer figure in one corner, a dinosaur made from junk, the robot from ET, pillars made up of drawers and tyres, the bar table mounted upon a line of barrels, a map made of number plates and a lot more, all of this give you a superb ambiance, and this got me hooked on with Junkyard. Kudos to Umang Tiwari for such a luxurious and spacious scrap yard that he has built up. It had been a dream project for Umang. The efforts do not end with the dcor. The innovations are quite visible in the food menu as well. Here food menu is also a plus point for all health conscious people who like to indulge in nutritious meals. We believe that entertainment should be guilt free, says Umang Tewari. When you want to enjoy your food, it should be done without getting worried on calories intake. Umang concludes that Junkyard cafe is for those who don't want to compromise on any of the thing when they step out, whether it's food, drinks, live gigs or ambiance. The menu at Junkyard is a showpiece. One section of the menu tells you how many calories are there in each dish that you order. The menu is extensive with choices from breakfast to appetizers to a full course meal. Moving now on to the food and drinks part of our review, we started with mock-tails section of the menu and ordered a few health conscious drinks. Junkyard offers some very fresh and inventive mock-tails. We had the Gardino, a mix of watermelon, celery, mint and beetroot juice, and the Citurs mart, mix of orange lime pomegranate and splash of ginger. Both the veggy/fruits mix juices were simply amazing and I was angry with myself of having not tried these combinations earlier at home. We also tried a few shakes form the menu namely the Strawberry coconut shake, and hazelnut butter scotch shake. Moving on with the food now, we started with the Honey Chilli potato which was superb. We wanted to try small portions of everything so we ordered a platter containing the Veg Salad, Nachos, Paneer Tikka, Kabuli badam Seekh Kebab and Spicy Onion Rings. We enjoyed and loved the presentations; the food immediately grabbed our attention and was as tasty as it looked. The Onion rings coated with Aloo Bhujiya were super. The mildly spicy and delectable Kabuli Badam Seekh Kebab were amazing and will definitely be on my order list when I come here again. Sesame Paneer Tikka was well marinated and cooked to perfection. The Paneer was wonderfully moist, soft and was delicious. I also wanted to try the Banshu aur Singhare ki Tikki, but regretted my decision. It was very hard and dry and I just left the entire serving after the first bite. Hari Bhari Palak and Soya Tikki was fresh and melted in our mouths. We were full on by now, and moving on to the main course, we just had the Veg Sushi platter. Well, honestly speaking, we didnt like the Sushi much. It was bland and tasteless. May be we were full by now, or may be we just dont have the palate and taste for a bland sushi serving. The Sushi had no pungency and were nicely made and were draped in the rice exactly the way they should be. But still we didnt like it. We still wanted to try something more, so we ordered a Vegetable Hargao a mixed vegetable Dimsum serving. This we relished and finished up even with full tummies. The Dim-sums at Junkyard were of high quality that came with a crystal clear outer layer. As I always say in my reviews, no meal is full for me without a nice dessert. Arey yarron I have to have a sweet before winding up, so for this KUCH MEETHA HO JAYE act, we had the yummy Nutella Cheesecake and the Crazy carrot cake. Both were perfect, the Carrot cake was so amazing, it completely bowled me over and made me promise the staff of a re-visit. So folks whether you like junk or not, rush to Junkyard, not to sell your junk that you can sell at quikr or Olx. At the caf, just chill out and enjoy your food n drinks..",Rated 4.0,19,38,??

Tania Gulati,"Rated I was awwstruck as I entered this newly opened place. Huge premises with amazing interiors. They have got wonderful seating and even an open terrace. Sober and cooperative staff. They have got an extensive menu with various cuisines. We ordered cheese balls, a thincrust paneer tikka pizza and orange juice. Juice was fresh and good. Even the food tasted quite well, only flaw being that the cheese balls were too cheesy that made them more salty. Overall, its a must visit, or rather it should be on the top of your list next time.",Rated 4.5,37,199,??
Priya Dubey Pachori,"Rated Another great place by Big Fish Ventures, huge space and uniquely designed interiors with junk and antiques (loved the pillar made of wooden drawers and the bulbs used at the bar counter). Music was good, however did not like the in house DJ for that day much, the place deserves more. The only thing which I personally did not like is that the music gets too loud inside the restaurant with the time which makes it difficult to have a conversation. We ordered Nachos overload, Bhatti ka murg tikka and Veg kebab for the starter.Perfectly balanced in flavours and Nachos was overloaded in true sense...loved the cheese it was served with. For the mains we ordered, Smoked chicken Pizza, Penne Pomodaro and whole wheat spaghetti with red sauce...could not find a single flaw in the dish. Cheese in the Pizza tasted really fresh.Loved each bite of it. The staff was kind enough to suggest and customize the dishes as per our need.

Dilsefoodie,"Rated The Junkyard is a concept restaurant which is very differently made up of junk and antiques; they are placed and have been hanged from all over the ceilings and walls. They have made it very uniquely with interesting things like a live size helicopter hanged on one part of ceiling, placed a Robot structure; one of the part of the restaurant ceiling has 8000 pint bottles hangings, small detailing which creates a very engaging and full of arty affair like barrel drums, transistors and many more stuff. Interesting they have placed a structure of a bike which is the best photo opp one has in any restaurant. Colors and the ceiling height create the place very huge and worthwhile to visit. Easily accessible through metro or public commutes. The menu is extensive and is meant for health-conscious people who like nutritious meals with choices from breakfast to appetizers to a full course meal. We started our food journey from prawns to chicken to bamboo shoot which is surprising came with a huge portion size. From the drink menu we tried their signature cocktail Skelton & Edison bulb, they are a nice creation. They have great deals for corporates on alcohol packages. Tried their main course too with Mutton Curry and Prawn salt & pepper with Rice & breads needless to say the portion size is handful and the preparation is good. You must visit with friends, families, kids as its a very kid friendly place. Dj does a good work with mixing and getting into the tempo. Its a place that offers healthy grub at reasonable prices.This place is meant for those who enjoy keeping it casual and going out for a good meal in a funky environment. Great food . Great music. Great drinks . Great ambience .. @The Junkyard Cafe",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

I liked the place. It's decently priced and good service.",Rated 3.5,10,53,??
Aashna Malhotra,"Rated The ambience of the place is pretty unique and amazing, and food is also good. However, the point worth mentioning is their horrible service. You'll have to continuously look for waiters as no one will be around you. They didn't even give us water and when asked, got just one glass for the person who asked for it. They would take away the menu cards even when we asked them to let them stay on the table as we had to order again. The service time was okay, not very quick but not extremely slow either, but they really need to work on their service overall.",Rated 3.5,22,73,??
Shivika Berry,"Rated They have taken the name quite literally when it comes to the interiors. Quite amazingly done, would give you the feel of a junk house. From old bikes to the seating, everything speaks for itself. The terrace area has unbalanced tables and chairs which we realized have been intentionally done to give you the junkyard feel. Coming to the food, we initially went for a couple of beers and not the food but ended up ordering a chocolate mousse cheesecake too and the decision literally paid off really well. That was the best cheesecake I had ever had. Being a dessert lover it was easy for me to judge and compare and honestly this cheesecake absolutely had no match. Quite well made, the perfect texture and sweetness it was just the perfect cheesecake. Totally worth it. In all an amazing experience. I'm definitely visiting here again to try the nutella cheesecake.",Rated 4.5,10,126,??

The furniture and antics used for the interiors speak for themselves. The staff is cordial and really sweet. The food tastes yummiest and the liquer and food menu is full of varieties! The shisha menu is quite exquisite in itself! We ordered peri peri pasta in red sauce and nachos with dips. The salsa dip was crisp and so was the pasta. It was a little chilli though but overall accompanied with cocktails it was an amazing meal. The whisky bourbon cocktail was really nice. I did not like the hidden entrance thvh but it was a really amazing experience for a hang out place.,Rated 4.0,7,31,??
Neha Mehan,"Rated Undoubtedly an amazing place! Heard alot about the outdoor seating but getting a seat inside was a bliss because of the sunny day! The food, interiors, music and service wasn't disappointing at all. The cheese nachos were topped up with so much cheese. Its a treat for cheese lovers like me. Perry perry pasta was delicious too. The only challenge was to decrypt the menu.. instead of calories which are listed it would have been much better if the constituents were mentioned. But overall a must try.",Rated 4.0,3,40,??

The also have an outer sitting area which gives you the feel of the rooftop, light heaters were placed adequately which kept us warm. The music is a bit loud inside the restaurants and it's difficult to have a conversation there. We tried honey chilli potato which was superb but the chilli and oregano garlic bread was a total waste. There was apparently no cheese and chilli in it. In drinks, Edison bulb cocktail with vodka in it was good. They also offer you some healthy drinks out of which we tried Root collage which was nice as well.

Rishnita Bhandari,"Rated Loved the place, mainly because of the outdoor sitting and the decor of the place! I had three dishes, none of which disappointed me! CHEESY NACHOS : It nachos were topped with loads of cheese, jalapeos, cream; served along with tangy yet tasty dip! Don't let it dry, or else you'd have to scrape cheese from the corner of the bowl! PERI PERI CHICKEN : This was one stuffing pizza. Thin crusts, with cheese evenly spread, along with chicken fingers on each of the slice (See Picture) BHATTI KA MURG TIKKA : Big chicken pieces served with onion ringa and standard green chutney! The pieces were a bit hard to dig into, but it was worth the trouble. We also took a bucket of beer containing 6 beers, from their combos, which was a pocket friendly deal! The ambience is awesome, with hip songs playing in the background, and a little traffic chaos if you took the outdoor sitting.

Siddharth Michael Sudhakar,"Rated Hit the follow button !! Much Love is needed !!!I went there for a office meet up so could not take any photos. Sorry for that but I will give me review briefly !! The newly opened junk yard cafe is an addition to the long list of cafes in central CP. The main concept of the place is Junk. Although the place is not junk at all. The interiors and the uniform of the servers - all derived from Junkyard. Good new concept. On the food front - It was average. No new tastes or flavors as such. Although very tasty food. Lamb Dallops were tasty and crisp. The Chilli cottage cheese was the best of the lot. Epic tasty. The penne vodka with rose sauce was also good , although I could not tell a difference between it and a normal red pasta. On the drinks front. I tried their Edison bulb. Number three one - the watermelon one. It looks good - presentation wise. It was very bad in taste and not quantity at all. Went for vodka after that. It is the same thing nothing fresh as such.

Drinks we had: #Hazelnut and Butter scotch shake- It had a perfect blend butterscotch & hazelnut. It was sweet, creamy and bold all at the same time. #Edison bulb (vodka with watermalon &lime juice)- This drink was so awesome in taste. It was a bittersweet drink with grown up taste. loved it especially its presentation. Now comes food: #Honey chilli potato - Delicious! Served hot and crispy. Perfect balance of chilli and honey. #Primavera Pasta - Average...this white sauce pasta was a bit flat in taste as per my taste buds. #Paneer Tikka Pizza - this thin crust pizza was crunchy, crusty, Delightful, cheesy, spicy, mouthwatering....enjoyed every bite of it.

The waiters weren't able to handle the customers well enough, perhaps because of the day being the 1st of January. Due to poor preparation of the bruschetta, one of the waiters served it to us saying it was cheese garlic bread. The paneer tikka, cheese ball and Prima Vera paste dishes were quite delicious. Again because of excess pressure due to 1st of January, the waiters weren't quite able to handle the orders. Overall a good experience. Looking forward to another visit soon.",Rated 4.0,36,134,??

Sukrity Wadhwa,"Rated The ratings for this place were highly misleading. They have tried to give the feel of a junkyard, as the name suggests, but failed to do so. It clearly looks like a fake junkyard and rather a lazy effort in terms of doing the interiors. The ambiance is similar to Vault cafe, darkness all around and dim yellow lights. In a corner or two you might spot a tyre hanging on a wall or something like that. The service is also not on point. The servers take time to take your order and then getting your order is another time consuming task. The place might burn a whole in your pocket.Our order included a regular pan flavour sheesha, a caramel cold coffee, a bacardi shot, 4 pints of beer, a dish of mesto veggie grilledsandwichand we paid around 4k for all this. Though, the prices are same as any other cafe in CP these days but with that kind of service, ambiance and not too great in terms of food taste you definitely get the feeling that it's not worth it.

Sidhant Ahuja,"Rated The Junkyard Cafe is another theme based cafe that has been opened up. The decor is inspired by the junk that we literally throw away. There is a huge transformer made of scrap at the entrance. Then there are other show pieces like the dinasaur made of crap metal and steel, they have empty beer bootles on one of the ceilings. It is a huge cafe with plethora of seating arrangement. Some seats are made of front and back of old cars. They also have an outdoor section. Tried the Minto Plus from the Health Conscious section. This was a concoction of watermelon,kaffir lime and fresh mint. This was more like a juice and was very refreshing to drink. The classic chicken tikka was the plain old tikka,very nicely done,neither spicy nor bland it was perfect. Thai spring rolls were good too. These were crispy fried spring rolls with vegetables inside.Eaten with red chilli had a good flavour to it. Crystal Chicken and Chive dumplings could have been better. The outer layer of the dumpling was thick,although the flavour inside was good. The dumplings were served with chili , thai chili , soy sauce , ginger paste among with other sauces. For main course we had the jamaican jerk chicken and peri peri chicken pasta. The Jamaican jerk chicken was basically fried chicken served with french fries. It was very crisp and there was hardly any chicken in it. Peri Peri pasta too was average,although the presentation was good. The chicken was at the top of pasta topped with cheese. To end our meal we had the Nutella Cheese Cake. This was more like new york cheese cake,but it was good in taste. This was a firm cheesecake with a hard base. On the whole The Junkyard Cafe has certainly lived upto its name,the decor will definitely will leave you flabbergasted. Also due to plenty of seating arrangement the place is perfect to visit with family,friends or loved ones.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Bishmeet Gujral,"Rated One of the most talked about places of Delhi, Junkyard cafe visit had been a special one for me especially due to its drinks and ambience and of course food as well. Located in N block connaught place just above townhouse cafe. I would recommend kindly book your table in advance if you don't want to wait here to grab a table. We were three people and we started with chilli chicken, peanut masala, chicken spring rolls. Chilli chicken was great as it had right mix of spices, not too spicy just rightly served. Spring rolls were good but not extraordinary. We also ordered on staff recommendation, 5 spice chicken which is chef speciality as well. It was very tasty. Soft crispy spicy chicken pieces served with pita bread is a must must try. There is something known as Chello kebabs, chicken kebabs served with rice and sauce was unique and worth trying. Coming to drinks now - i have been very fascinated with this Skeleton drink which is a cocktail available in three different combinations. I chose the one with dark rum mixed with hazelnut, vanilla sugar, lime juice topped with cola. It was very strong though but if you prefer vodka base you can opt for that one as well. Overpriced i would say as they don't even have happy hours. This is one negative point as Rs.600 for a cocktail excluding taxed is too much. Anyways, other cocktail was Edison bulb yard in which my frnd chose vodka base with watermelon, basil and lime juice. This one was not as strong as the skeleton one and was more sweeter. The best cocktail i liked was Caipiroska. The best one. Overall, i enjoyed being here and i wanted to try this place. I forgot to mention they have seating both inside and outside. Since its winter time outdoor seating idea is more fun. My rating - 4/5.",Rated 4.0,83,348,??

I can't certainly stop appreciating their ambience .It just won my heart. Next coming to its , health conscious glimpse of the dishes , to their worth reading menu ,I was astonished seeing the diverse menu . The staff was really helpful and educated ... I asked for their recommendations for ordering the dishes due to their mind boggling variety . I was recommended FOUR SEASON PIZZA AND SMOKED CHEESE BALLS ALONG WITH A NICE MOCKTAIL!! Trust me , the order appeared in like 20-25 min.. the first bite I took of the PIZZA I was in heaven ..it contained the right amount of cheeses along with crunchy veg toppings . The CHEESE BALLS were by far the best I 've ever tasted . It was like it was melting in my mouth and was served with pickled veggie.. that just added to the flavour . The watermelon mojito was amazing and refreshing. The place on the terrace was worth to sit n chat over a couple of smokes and sheesha ! So , just one word --->MUST VISIT !! :*",Rated 5.0,2,25,??

Ridhi Arora,"Rated New addition to the word of cafes in Connaught Place. The place is based on the theme of a garage and the decor inside definitely lives up to the name of the place. Kudos to the interior team, they have done a great job - with a ceiling full of beer bottles, seating imitating a vintage car seat, walls full of car parts, engine parts, washroom decor etc etc. However, coming to the food and the staff, the food was nothing more than ordinary and a let down. We ordered: French fries - soggy and not crisp Red Sauce pasta - with barely any vegetables in it - pretty average Nachos - the salsa sauce along with it was really good Pizza - good but not the best Hookah - way too overpriced!! 1000 for a hookah Drinks - the Wine which I ordered was not available so I settled for a Sangria which was good! Service - service was a bit slow and the staff was not paying heed to any suggestions, never did they once ask if the service was okay or are we satisfied. The music was good and this place can definitely be the next happening place of CP because of the great ambience. However, That might be the only reason I might visit this place again and not for the food",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The interior is very innovatively done using junk. From the booze, to shesha to the food, everything was great. Must try in drinks are the Graveyard drink 2 and Edison bulbs. We mostly ate appetizers and would recommend their paneer tikka, French fries, crispy pepper chicken, peanut chicken.

For food, we ordered paillard of chicken with lemon and herbs which was amazingg along with four season veg pizza. The menu should be updated here, as the items are underpriced.

Zoravar,"Rated Before writing the review of this place, I'd like to point out that twice visits mere made over two weeks. The first time i went, the service was quick and pleasant. The decor is quite creative and seating is quite comfortable. I was so pleased with the service, that i thought it would be an apt place for some sun bathing and brunching with some cousins. For the second visit, the next time i decided to sit down outside. But things went downhill, the service ignored me completely for the next 15 minutes. Left alone water, or menu cards, they couldnt complete basic cleaning for the table and on the floor. After speaking to the Manager, (who was courteous and apologetic) fixed the situation and my mood immediately. The situation went back to pleasing and comfortable. Food - I have tried various items off the Menu including Thai spice chicken Pizza, Pepperoni Pizza, Four Season vegetarian Pizxa, Thai Green and Red Curry Chicken with Steamed Rice, Chilli Chicken, Crispy Sesame Potatoes, Paneer tikka, Murg Achaari Tikka and Dal Makhani. All of these tasted great and delicious. Drinks - I have tried out their Edison Bulb cocktail Vodka based, The draught Erdinger beer and Virgin Mojito or Iced Tea's.

And the bar area was amazing . The service is really fast and the staff is helping and courteous. We ordered sushi, pasta, pizza and sheesha. Since it was the first time i tried sushi I can't rate it but the other two dishes were outstanding.

Anikesh Gupta,"Rated Actual Junk pieces in the food of Junkyard Cafe !!! 3 of us went there for lunch, we ordered Kadai Paneer and Dal Makhni with naan, food was tasty. However, after few bites i noticed something hard in my mouth and when i took it out i was shocked to see a piece of green coloured sharp edged plastic (almost like glass) which was probably in Kadai Paneer. We asked for manager, he came and said just 'sorry' and same reply we got from chef. We were more worried if it might have gone inside the stomach and may prove lethal. Eventhough the manager did not let us pay the bill which could have worked as a proof, but this kind of blunder might cost someone their life. I never had this kind of experience anywhere in delhi and never expected such type of thing at a reputed place like Junkyard Cafe. Will never come again and suggest others to be very careful while eating there !! I hope i will be fine !!",Rated 1.0,2,34,??

We ordered Chilli potato, Loaded nachos and Pomodoro pasta. It was good in both quality and quantity. A few drinks here are served in very unusual glasses.

Purva Keshav,"Rated NEVER BOOK A TABLE ONLINE ! It was my birthday treat and I had booked a table for 10 people through the zomato link. I got a confirmation email stating that my table has been booked. When we reached there, we were told there was no booking on my name . On showing him the mail , the guy at the entrance was ready to give us a table outside . What's the use of booking a table 7 hours in advance if you ask us to stand by the bar or sit outside in chilling cold. We tried arguing with him and the best he could come up with was - ""people who book a table on phone are given seats inside."" I mean come on ! If this is the case , they should clearly mention it while we book tables online. He continued arguing with us , so we decided to approach higher management. I would have said they have the best management team ever , if I came from sarcasmland. The manager inside told us we could take one seat and we will have to leave by 9.30. By this time I had lost my calm. I told him we were a group of 10 people with an employee database of over 15000 people and all of us will individually send emails stating their behaviour . Only then we got a seat and we're told by the manager , a Mr. SINHA, that he was giving us someone else's seat , as if he is doing us a favor. My birthday mood was spoilt and I deeply regret throwing a party here. I will never recommend anyone to plan a party here. I have attended and thrown parties at so many cafes/pubs , they always have a birthday song or a friendly gesture for the host , here all they could offer me was irritation and frustration.

We tried north indian (chicken curry), sushi, mezze platter (extremely disappointing in comparison to the other restaurants that I have tried in CP) and drinks which were favourably ok. The servers also serve food with the least amount of interest, they dont offer suggestions to the huge set of choices that the restaurant offers (which is where I think the problem lies).. I have to say that the drinks were quite refreshing but the food was extremely disappointing for the price that was associated with them (most probably due to the posh location of the restaurant, right next to Barbeque nation in the outer circle). Do try the drinks, they are quite refreshing without expecting much from the food served.

Food: the first time we went, we ordered white sauce vegetarian pasta and four seasons vegetarian pizza (we were all vegetarians. Yes). The pizza was alright but I liked the pasta way more. My friends ordered a sheesha which turned out to be a disappointment. The flavour wasn't right at start and we had to ask the guy to fix it atleast 5 times within 45 minutes. By the end of it we gave up. The second time I went it got a little interesting as my friend who I went with is a huge gym freak. So he knows his food and calories and all such measurements. The moment he saw the menu where they have mentioned the calories and stuff in each dish, he said no way these measurements are correct. He wasn't convinced by any dish description, not even one. But we thought let's just try. So he went with a steak and I ordered penne red sauce and we ordered sheesha as well. This time sheesha was better but still alot of trouble. My pasta arrived way quicker than his steak and honestly I really liked it. On the other hand, when he finally got his steak, he was very disappointed just by looking at it. ""The smallest portion of steak as as main dish I have ever seen. Isse kya hoga."" He said. I'm as vegetarian so I don't have much knowledge about meat dishes but even I could tell that that dish could be eaten within 10 minutes and would do nothing to your hunger. In terms of taste, he said it was average. Service: no complaints with the service as both the times the guys were very prompt is taking orders or complaints and very quite polite and nice. However, I did go during the day both the times when it was quite empty. So I can only hope the service is as good at night if and when the place gets packed. Price: Can't call it expensive as the dishes are priced the same as any other such place these days. They say their alcohol is cheap which just means they sell one or two beers for real cheap and others more money. We would still prefer a happy hour. Sheesha is expensive though. Really didn't want to pay that much for a bad sheesha. I would definitely suggest a one time visit atleast as I experienced both good and bad things but mostly I would say go for a one time experience and then decide for yourself if you want to return or not! Great interiors - different and funky BUT didn't like the menu design at all. It's confusing and unclear and takes a while to figure out.",Rated 3.0,22,228,??

Srinathiyer,Rated Brilliant decor. Rook sometime for to check it out. Brilliant food. Stuffed myself and then stuffed again?. The chef personally made a fantastic lip smacking pork belly just the way I wanted. Small rooftop space to sit in the winters. Hookahs available. Inside was huge airy. Not like the cramped up restaurants and cafes. Each table has enough privacy. The only thing that put me off was the service. Though hardly 7 to 9 tables were occupied the service was very poor. Orders were messed up. What was ordered never arrived. But I guess the food kind of made up for that. Will certainly go again someday or maybe do a take away. Hopefully service would have improved. Would have given a 4.5 or 5 if the service had been good Went to this place again. Service not improved. Took them almost an hour to get a mug of beer.. after reminding them at least 4 times. Service sucks.,Rated 2.5,23,40,??
Anu Bhat,"Rated This place surely does justice to its name. Their rooftop has a perfect overview for the winter season. When you enter the indoor cafe, you seem to feel it's too stuffed up but when seen properly they have good distinctive space between all tables. Their hookah is comparatively good when it comes to cp standards, moreover they don't throw tantrums to change the coal, but sometimes even do it themselves without even asking. I was impressed by their sushi served with wasabi. Stuffed eggs sounds more delicious than what it was when served. Thai pizza was good, while beef Burger was too dry & even though extra cheese was specifically mentioned, it was just about the beef Patty.",Rated 3.5,14,51,??

A very unique and interesting furniture and decoration. The manager at entrance was a lil rude. But all the staff inside were very efficient and another good this is the place is adequately staffed. The menu is very elaborated and there are so many options in different types of cuisines that it becomes difficult to chose something. But all the dishes we had were nicely prepared, decent quantity and delicious. Whether it be norh indian, chinese or italian everything was tasty. In the drinks section also they have a very wide variety of options. And what i was amazed to see was that the place was not that highly priced like other places in cp. Service was very satisfactory and there was always a waiter a just a call away ready to serve us. The best thing about this place is the DJ and the sound system. The music was so lively and amazing that it juat made our night. We enjoyed it during the meal and danced to tunes at the end of the night.

On a busy Sunday it was occupied but still had the space only because it has large seating area. I personally loved the inside area. ? We didn't order much. However, i will review for vegetarian ones for now. Cheese balls : were not good in taste. Cheese rolls or something cottage cheese were super yum ? Mixed sauce pasta was good Corona was available. And I don't remember the other dishes. But i loved it. One more pointer : the quantity was less. Music was good. But we were not served water unless asked - which i have been writing from years should be the first thing to do (or ask for). Overall it was good ?

Aditi Lal,"Rated Couldn't identify where this restaurant is at first, with a small board sign near barbeque nation. The terrace area was full and not because of the weather or anything, but because of the paint smell inside the restaurant-cum-bar. The ambience inside looked really good and innovative though. Coming to the food, we ordered spaghetti with pesto and one four seasons pizza. They were really good. The pizza cheese was so stretchy and I personally loved it. The quantity for the spaghetti was a little less but everybody can't make it properly and they did! Thumbs up for that! We also ordered for a burger but even after one hour, it didn't arrive. So we had to cancel it. We drank bubble gum ice tea which was a bit too sour. The service is good and the servers are polite but they need to get trained a bit because they are not harmonious amongst themselves.

Obviously, I do not exactly remember the names. 4. The place is huge with outside roof also available. 5. Drinks and hukkas available in variety. 6. Service was quick in the beginning, but then we had to follow up for the food we ordered which I did not like at all. 7. 4 season pizza was delicious but pasta arabiana was the worst pasta I ever had. 8.

Anoop Kamath,"Rated Today I decided to visit The Junkyard Cafe, which is the new kid on the block. N Block to be precise (Connaught Place). Junkyard Cafe is on the second floor of the block and occupies humongous space indoors and outdoors. As the name suggests, the decor is innovative industrial and runs on the theme junk. The interior designer, Tutu, has done a marvelous job in sticking to the theme. So we have pillars made of empty oil drums, wooden drawers painted in different hues, slated windows, used car tyres painted myriad colours, corrugated sheets for ceiling, exhaust fans, loud speakers and dish antennae, old radio and record players and countless other automobile parts welded together beautifully to give this restaurant a quirky look. In one corner you get to see a dinosaur made of junk facing a autobot similar to the one in Transformers movie. The manager gave us a tour of the place. As an artist, I liked the portrait of Monalisa made of electronic junk. Also, close to the bar, there is large aircraft made of junk, hung from the ceiling. The bar itself occupies the length of the restaurant and is well lit and stocked up. There are also quirky glassware like a skull and a light bulb shaped glass to serve alcohol. The service staff, aptly, are dressed in orange overalls. We were seated on a cutaway portion of an old Ambassador car boot converted into a comfortable sofa. The large cushions were made of stuffed jute bags. Here you get no two similar tables of chairs. The canopy above us was made of 8,000 empty Kingfisher beer bottles strung together and held by a net. The interesting decor is only a giveaway. When it comes to food, the restaurant fails to deliver. We ordered a Smoked Chicken Caesar Salad, Grilled Chicken Breast with Couscous and Healthy Fish and Chips with Tartare Sauce. The salad was good with fresh lettuce, large chunks of smoked chicken and nice cheese shavings. The healthy version of the fish (only 373 calories, claims the menu card) had three medium sized pieces of Basa fish with a large portion of chips, a small portion of salad and tartare sauce. Since the fried fish was dunked in oil, my partner decided to let go rest of the portion and we had to get it packed. The Grilled Chicken Breast was served with a small portion of Couscous (good), a tangy and spicy red sauce and grilled vegetables. The chicken breast was fibrous and so were the vegetables served with it, especially beans and baby corn. The Junkyard Cafe essentially is a watering hole with an option for good snacks.

Vibhanshu Jain,"Rated Was a gud visit to this place. We were a group of four friends. Indoor seating is pretty good, ambience is nice and a gud really gud paneer tikka pizza. Garlic bread was nice but not worthy enough. Burger was a real big dissapointment, considering the cost, the size and quality was a big low. There are many cafes fork you kindaa serving really good burgers. Outdoor seating is kindaa good, nice view but it lacks the comfort in the seating that is expected. Overall had a good experience but as for a good indian cost matters most and this isnt upto the exact worthy place for some of the items in the menu.",Rated 3.5,3,46,??

Megha Jain,"Rated The first thing to notice is music. Second comes the stairs leading to the Junkyard and once you are there, your eyes won't atop wondering to all the junk art they have. Lighting, seating and art everywhere is what makes this place a great handout. We tried Bloody mary (minus alcohol) and it was wow. Next we tried Peri peri pasta which was instant to fall on love with. We ordered dumplings which tasted great with the many sauces. All in all. Loved this place. Not a place if you are looking for a place to talk since music is really loud.

Aparajita,"Rated It is worth checking out this new place that is trending in cp. The interiors are true to the name, done beautifully using scraps of junk and metal. Ordered five spice chicken, cosmopolitan and sangaria. Five spice chicken was delicious..warm pita bread with delectable chargrilled chunks of chicken tossed with onions and tomatoes,served with pickled vegetables and hummus you could kill for! Must try! Both the drinks were good with the right portion of alcohol ..what stole the show was presentation of cosmo..it was served inside a bulb with smoke used to elevate the effect and a glow-in-the-dark band under the bulb, order this one for both taste and presentation.",Rated 4.5,20,37,??

Parvinder Singh Kalsi,"Rated Last night I was here to celebrate a friends birthday. Nearest metro- Barakhamba Road. Take the exit at Gate number 6 and walk straight towards N block. Take left from the Oxford bookstore. If that doesn't help, this place is on the same floor as the Barbeque Nations. Junkyard Cafe, as the name suggests, is a newly opened place that is decorated and built using metal frames, cargo boxes, tin cans, drums and meshes. The seating is divided into indoor and outdoor. Smoking is prohibited indoors. Even the waiters and bartenders wear uniforms and caps that would give you the feel of Junkyard! This place couldn't do more to justify its name. The in-house DJ will make sure you shake a leg or two on his tracks! Being a teetotaller, I ordered the Gardino which is made of watermelon, beetroot, celery and mint. This ones for the health conscious one. If you want a drink that tastes better then go for the Minto Plus which is prepared using watermelon, mint and lime. We ordered a Sesame Paneer Tikka, Stirred fry Lotus Roots and Water Chestnuts, smoked cheese balls and Kabuli Badami Seek. The Paneer tikka was well marinated and grilled. It was slightly on the spicier side. The highlight here was the stirred fry lotus roots which were amazing! The flavors and seasoning was perfect! The Smoked Cheese Balls were okayish. I found the Kabuli Badami seek to be bland and was lacking any taste. The staff was courteous and helpful. The service was quick even when the house was filled to its capacity!

Just as the name suggest the place totally depicts a Junkyard. The interiors are rusty and give a very different look to the place. We were a couple of friends hanging around in CP when we decided to have an evening of unwinding. The place is easily accessible and exotic. It was the perfect weather to sit outside and enjoy the evening. The sitting is very comfortable and overlooks the busy street, music peps you up and sets you in the mood. Fot food we ordered chilly chicken, falafel with hummus and pitta, mustard fish tikka, batti ka murg tikka, smoked cheese balls and pork belly and a penned pasta in arabiatta and sushiiiii, the sushi here is totally a bliss. ..... The food was literally amazing. My personal favourite was pork belly chilly dry. I mean if you are a pork fan you must try this. It is absolutely succulent and juicy. In drinks we ordered a red wine sangrias, edison bulbs and a whiskeys. We sat and enjoyed our drinks and food for almost 3 hours here. And trust me when I say the time flew. The hospitality of the place is truly awesome. The chef himself came and asked if we were happy with everything This experience was truly delightful. It's not very expensive and for the place and the food it's totally worth the price. I am certainly going back! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED xoxo",Rated 4.5,137,1843,??

GJ,"Rated This section of CP looks like a mini cyber hub. With 3-4 restaurants lined up with a common front on 2nd floor in N Block. You enter via 1 common lift and then they all fall one after the another. Junkyard Cafe is towards the end of this lane. While the interiors are impressive, exteriors are plain normal. Could be anywhere. Since the weather is good, everyone wants to be outside. The host as kind enough to get us a table outside which we much appreciated. We ordered Veg Pizza (good in taste), Penne pasta (average) and Veg seekh Kebab (average again). Food is more or less of average taste. They do have a winner at hands when it comes to cocktails. We ordered for Metal Blender (tequila and triple sec based cocktail): this was very very good. Taste , flavours and alcohol levels were bang on. We moved onto Edison Bulb but with Tequila based. This looks very nice but came very warm. Had to return the same and got refreshed with more ice. Sheesha was ok ok. Service is average to good.

The platter has got tasty tikkis (tastiest of all) paneer was average and the kebabs were not upto the mark.

Poonam Chakraborty,"Rated This is a cafe with great concept and Everything for us comes down to food. I am not an alcohol person while my friend ordered for Edison Bulb I sticked to ""Gardino"" now this drink is a combination of Watermelon, Celery, Beetroot and mint now this is really good for your health. Ignore the health part I like watermelon ! Followed by One Banana and cake shake. For Starters we called in for Sausage mushroom caps, Lamb Seekh Kebabs, Murgh malai Tikka, Sushi Platter. What I really enjoyed out of these is the sausage mushroom caps. Mushrooms were juice topped with sausage and cheese and not too spicy, comes across to be really light on your taste palettes and perfect starter. Sushi can be skipped. I am always craving for good burgers and being a fish fan the word ""Wasabi Fillet-o-fish burger"" caught my eye. While my friend wanted to order something else looking at my puppy face he couldn't say no to me on this one. And thank god I ordered this one. Bang On ! Fillet was crispy, the fish was fresh and perfectly cooked, Wasabi enhanced the taste and I so loved it. MUST HAVE'S. We ordered for Bulgogi Beef, Laal Maas and Khaw Suey. Laal Maas was too high on spices but it needed to be HOT which it wasn't. The chily was actually missing and you can taste all other spices and aromatics instead. Can be improved. Bulgogi beef and Khao Suey were fine. What disappointed me is the dessert section while on the menu there are more than 7-8 options they had none when we asked for it. The only option was to have brownie and vanilla ice-cream which we decided to skip. but even the dessert section was tempting enough to read.

The place has a complicated menu, even the waiters admitted that they didn't understand it. The decision making was difficult and the waiters had no clue on the portion size.

Sachin Sahni,"Rated The Junkyard Cafe is a newly opened property in Connaught Place. Heard a lot about its existence through social media. Since then was really very eager and excited to visit the place and finally I was there to see this unique concept and taste the food. How To Reach : As The Junkyard Cafe is located in CP the best, easiest and the fastest way to be here is through the Metro. You may take metro from any nearby metro station till Rajiv Chowk Metro Station and exit from Gate No. 1 from there it is just a 5 minutes walk. To be very precise then if you've ever visited The Town House Cafe or Barbeque Nation then take the same lift to the 3rd floor and once you're there walk towards your right. There you'll see The Junkyard Cafe. Ambiance : Talking about the ambiance this restaurant, as the name suggests is actually Junkyard Theme based all over the place. Starting from the walls to the pillars, Main dining area to the restroom everything was very apt to its name as if we talk about the walls then you can see almost anything that you couldn't have imagined from the car number plates to a crooked copy of the very famous Mona Lisa Painting. If I talk about the pillars then it was made up of the recycled giant and painted truck tires and even if I simply talk about the roof then it was simply made up of recycled empty beer bottles (SEE PICTURES FOR THE REFERENCE) and if I talk about the sofa's then you'll be not be surprised if you would have thought that you will see the unmatched irregularity as every table have a different design all together. So, a very good and experimental ambiance and indeed a very new design that I've ever seen and definitely a very big thumbs up for that thought and effort. Drinks : The best drink that I loved out of the whole menu was from the Edison Bulb Yard which is actually named so because the drink that I was been served was in a bulb shaped glass and was served chilled on a dry ice and hence was indeed looking beautiful. The drink that I had was actually a perfect delicious blend of white rum, elderflower, vanilla, sugar, lime juice and rosemary. FYI (Elderflower cordial is a soft drink made largely from a refined sugar and water solution and uses the flowers of the European elderberry). Food : STARTERS As we were bunch of crazy foodie friends we ordered like a king an tasted a lot of food options like, * SAUSAGE MUSHROOM CAPS - Which was actually huge button mushrooms stuffed with sausages and cheese and baked till perfection and the best part was that in their menu every item has its Calorie count for the dish and this dish had a calorie count of 73 and costed Rs 345+++ * LAMB SEEK KEBAB : It was very moist, tender and frsh and could be really judged as if they were made straight out of the kitchen and are not outsourced from anywhere. Costed Rs 365+++ * MURGH MALAI TIKKA : Again very tender and could really taste the proper marination of ginger and garlic paste as i really can imagine when it comes to a perfect Malai Tikka. Definitely not the best but not even upsetting as it was very close to one of my favourite Malai Tikka place in town. The only difference was that thise tikka's were a bit more cooked well in a tandoor and their juicies were all seeped well inside every piece. Costed Rs 325+++ * VEG & NON VEG SUSHI PLATTER : Both the sushi platters have different varities of sushi among them. The most commonly known were Ebi Tempura, California Rolls, Prawn, Asparagus, Shiitake mushroom etc. The sushi's were all average except for few flavors and some of the common mistakes that I could figure out was (Which was not to be ignored at all) was their California Rolls as one cannot forget to put orange pearls while garnishing California Rolls as it is a trade mark for those types of standardized version of that sushi that can never be improvised. So, it was a bit disappointing moment over sushi journey. * WASABI FILLET 'O' FISH BURGER : Its indeed and surprisingly one of the best dish that I had in The Junkyard Cafe, as it quite unusual that I would have finished off my burger. But, this was indeed one of the best and the tastiest burger. The Fish patty fillet and the amazingly awesome wasabi dip was one of its kind. maybe very mild on flavors but indeed very tasty and a MUST TRY & MUST RECOMMENDED! Costed Rs 545+++ Each Burger. MAINS * BULGOGI BEEF : A very nice dish of beef topped on flat noodles. After the irrelevant Beef Ban in a lot of states in India I was indeed still proud that I was able to have this beautiful dish which was good to see in the menu. If I talk about the taste then it was not too amazing to my palate but was still able to quench my hunger for Beef after a long time. * KHAO SUEY : I have written about the history of Khao Suey in many of my reviews earlier as well and have proudly announced that the best Khao Suey that I've had so far was at Zamozza, CP which was still the same but at The Junkyard it was altogether the different version of the Khao Suey that I had at Zamozza and indeed it was good. Not comparing the taste but still it was good and a thumbs up! * LAAL MAAS : is a meat curry from Rajasthan, India. It is a mutton curry prepared in a sauce of curd and hot spices such as red chillies. This dish typically is very hot and rich in garlic, the gravy may be thick or liquid and is eaten with chapatis made out of wheat (usually eaten in summers) or bajra (a millet grown in Rajasthan and eaten in the winter months). To be very frank and honest the taste of this dish was simply outstanding and not to be missed at all at any cost. with this we ordered assorted bread basket which was very amazing and delicious and a must try! DESSERTS Dessert section was a bit disappointing affair as in their menu there were some of very uncommon and delectable desserts which were totally irresistible but when I asked the server that what would be the best dessert available then I was damn dissapointed as I got to know that only dessert available was Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream. So, I was unable to have the rest and it was actually the Sunday evening so it made me a bit more dissapointed. FINAL RATING : My final rating shall be 4 STARS out of 5 STARS as there were some flaws that are quite evident in the initial stage of a newly opened restaurant but I would definitely like to re visit the restaurant for its awesome vibe ambiance and some modifications done over the food and desserts. foodietreasure.blogspot.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Nidhi Kapur,"Rated The whole ambiance was highly gripping. It took me minimum 15-20 minutes to digest the innovation. Sofas made out if car dikkies, electric circuits used in sofas arranged nicely in a presentable manner. Drums used for table stands, coloured tyres used for decoration , small woodden pieces to create a fashion of design on sofas. So much to mention. Every detail was taken care. I tasted two mocktails- Citrus Mart and Root Collage. They were heavenly. Specially because, mocktails were made of fresh fruits and vegetables. The concept is to provide healthy and junk food to foodies. So if you take bar for example, its a combination of fresh fruit juices and drinks. Every food item in the menu had caloric value. Salad was a combination of freshly made sauces with green vegetables and breads. Five Spice Chicken on pita bread was good. Bread was thin and crispy. Chicken was soft, well marinated and juicy with perfect taste. There were toppings of onions and capsicum which are my all time favourite so I relished it. Lamb Shish Tawook was presented in an enticing fashion. I liked them as well. Five Spice Chicken on pita bread was good. Bread was thin and crispy. Chicken was soft, well marinated and juicy with perfect taste. There were toppings of onions and capsicum which are my all time favourite so I relished it. Lamb Shish Tawook was presented in an enticing fashion. I liked them as well. Pita bread with hummus and other sauces that included grated bottlegourd, curd base. Hummus could have been better. Loved the luscious combination though. Dimsums were toothsome as I could see keen attention to the style of chopped vegetables. They were yummy. I tried both chicken and vegetarian dimsums. A non vegetarian will never relish vegetarian more but for me, vegetarian dimsums were equally good and irresistible. In the end I had my favourite brownie worth ice cream. Although the restaurant is in process of getting things in place for enticing names in menu. Service was good at The Junkyard Cafe. Staff was courteous and well dressed. They paid attention to our requirements. Highly recommended restaurant for celebrations, parties for all ages, dineouts with someone special. I am going to visit this restaurant again with my family.",Rated 4.5,44,389,??
Udit Batra,"Rated Junkyard cafe simply put is the new talk in the capital and the buzz about the place is here's to stay! Conveniently located in N block of CP the place is located amongst the ever busy BBQ NATION and Town house Cafe. Reaching the place only if you search the place by N block as their location is not pin point on GPS. As you enter the place you see a lot of fancy junk right from tire piles to rugged tables and other amazing interiors. As per my knowledge their music system can put clubs to shame. The staff is courteous and helpful and the food too arrives on time with a smile on the server's face. FOOD Their Prawn Tempura sushi is undoubtedly the best I've had and is wonderfully accompanied by the soya sauce and wasabi paste. The murgh tikka is soft and moist with utmost balance of spices. The vegetarians can try their sausage mushroom caps and also hummus and pita bread that is stuffed with cheese. The buff steak too was well grilled and tossed in herb sauce, served alongside a portion of mashed potatoes. Their dimsums were steamed and then pan fried that made them an absolute delight, served with 6 varieties of dips. The laal maas and missi roti is one hell of a combination with mildly spiced meat with a bit of minced meat the missi roti acts as the perfect companion to the laal maas. The thai red curry in chicken with sticky rice was decent and is highly recommended. DRINKS I would highly recommend their Skeleton 1 which is a dark rum based cocktail with a kick and the all time favourites LIIT and Old fashioned. DESSERTS KAJU KATLI BAIDA with a reduced milk dip is a must have because of its mild yet ample sweetness. COCONUT DUSTED CHOCOLATE DIMSUMS- This undoubtedly is the best part of the meal as this one was already a buzz to my mind and came out so well. So soft dimsums filled with chocolate that are slightly warm, I'm drooling while writing this man. The service is amply quick and the staff is well versed about the menu which makes it a hassle free experience. It's a well deserved 4.5/5 fo junkyard cafe, the concept, the food and the hospitality as a whole. P.S. I'm in love with those jumpsuits that the staff is wearing.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Prachi Jain,"Rated We cannot even imagine how much effort must have gone into building this cafe because each and every inch is built with some junk materia. The organisation of the pieces is a classic example of perfection. There is also a raised platform for the music lovers to dance to the tunes of music played live by the DJ. I tried floral salvage fluid in which there were mild notes of vodka with slight sharpness of ginger ale, topped with aroma of hibiscus in every sip. Another innovative concoction that we tried was termed as Maroon Hat, which had strong notes of juicy beetroot balancing out the dryness of vodka. Hints of basil and vanilla flavour made it a refreshing and light cocktail best suited for a summer afternoon. Non-alcoholic drinks were mainly fruit juices mixed with nice flavours. One thing you can't help noticing about Junkyard is that they prepare basic elements in a different way, and luckily, they succeed in the same. Onion rings had very thin skin of onion inside and the covering was topped with potato bhujia which made it crispy as well as flavourful. Smoked cheese balls are generally loaded with oil and cheese but because as it is Junkyard Cafe, you will find them less oily yet equally fulfilling Another amazing entry was made by falafel. Those who don't opt for this Lebanese king because of its dry nature can safely have it here. It was not dry, and when combined with chilli flavoured sauce, it was absolute garlic mixed delight. The cottage cheese fingers had a little sweetness and very thin layer of crispy covering. The dimsums and Bao menu is something not to be missed. As soon as the Mezze platter was placed on the table, our eyes kept rolling to see what all have been presented. Servings included salads, Muhamarra and Baba Ghanoush which tasted pleasurably unusual. Even the way in which they prepare the Pita Breads is different.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Vibhu Gogia,"Rated This place was like a breath of fresh air in the ever crowded cafe scene in CP. The setting was just perfect for the theme and that was exactly what differentiated Junkyard Cafe from others in the area. So happy with where we were sitting we decided to order French Fries, Chicken Wings, Nachos Overloaded & Peri Peri Chicken Pizza to accompany our Beers. Here is what stood out and what was not so good about my experience: HITS: The setting was probably the best thing about this place. In terms of food, the fries and chicken wings are good but the mayo dip with which they were served made them delightful. MISSES: The Nachos Overloaded were supposed to contain much more than only Nachos, however I struggled to find the cheese and veggies which were supposed to be present. Same was the case with pizza which although tasted good, but contained very less of chicken. The biggest disappointment however was the music. The management needs to understand that people come here in groups to enjoy and during such times playing romantic love ballads may not be the best option. All in all a good and a different experience.",Rated 4.0,18,207,??
Himanshii,"Rated As soon as i stepped into Junkyard, it was all good and happy. (Though the entrance reminds you of those ""chawl system"" you studied in books) Its Choti Diwali and we wanted to check-in to somewhere really fine. The ambiance The Food The Mocktails Sheesha was So-So I would have rated it, 4.0 but the climax was a blunder. I asked for the bill, waiter was already having the bill and they didn't avail us the 15% discount on total bill (the we were supposed to get by advanced reservation from DineOut) So bluntly he refused for it, I told them if I need to Call the DineOut customer care. Then they were ready to give us the discount. The bill was around 2700 and after discount they made it 2411 which was not 15%. THESE GUYS ARE COMPLETELY CHEATERS ! Secondly, The staff is so ignorant, if asked to click the pictures, they easily ignore us. Like they are not listening! A photograph is something that you can show to your friends so that they too would make mind to go to that place, since we don't have any good pictures.. Its their loss. Negative hospitality!

Divya Arya,"Rated With so many new places opening up, especially in CP, it's hard to stand out but with this kind of creativity and innovation, it's absolutely possible. Be it the ravishing interiors, which give the feeling of a junkyard but in style or the menu which has been designed both for the regulars and the calorie conscious. The presentation too is delightful and the cocktails especially are a must try. The servers all wear a certain uniform which adds to the theme and know the menu well. The moment I entered, I was astonished, this place is huge, with a stage, comfortable seating space and a nice bar. I couldn't help but notice the big plane on the ceiling near the bar. A lot has gone into making this place look the way it does. From the menu, I chose to try the following: Edison Bulb 3 - Watermelon, Basil and vodka, you can't go wrong with this combination but the outstanding part was the presentation. Fresh Fruit Screw Driver - Fresh orange juice does enhance the taste of the drink and takes it to another level. Veg Tandoori Platter - A mix of paneer tikka, singare ki tikki and chana ka seekh kebab. The paneer tikka was soft and nice. The tikki was quite different but well prepared and the seekh kebab was delicious, my favourite out of the three. Veg Chinese Platter - As I wanted to try more dishes from the menu, I asked them if they could give me a Chinese platter. So this one had spring rolls, crispy potato, chilly paneer and salt & pepper. I loved the crispy potato, it was slightly sweet and the sesame seeds made it just right. The salt & pepper was delectable and I kept going back for more. The chilly paneer could have been spicier but nevertheless it was great. Mushroom and Thyme Risotto - This is something I order every time I see it on the menu but very few times is it this good. Cottage Cheese Steak - The cottage cheese was cooked very well with an amazing sauce. The mashed potatoes were almost in liquid form and piped on the side which added to the taste of the dish along with the sauteed vegetables. Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake - A layer of cheesecakes and a layer of chocolate mousse cake put together, of course it had to be heavenly.

Suhani Rampal,"Rated I was since the very beginning quite excited about this new place where me and my friends were invited and to my satisfaction , it didn't disappoint me a single bit. Its an amazing ambience to be in , the roof top , the chilly wind and the calmness offers you a rejuvenating experience. The inside seating area is quite of the junkyard theme but me and my friends any day prefer the outdoor rooftop . The waiters are dressed as those who actually work in junkyards with dangris and that adds on to the whole look that this place has managed to pull off with the junk theme. My stay at this place was short , but I tasted all that was possible in that time. The starters were different and really yumm. They offer varieties of different drinks (cocktails) with names you would hear the first time. I tried the Edison bulb#2 with Gin. The way the drink is presented is just too fascinating. And the taste with the strong alcoholic pinch is too good. The offer nice sangria as well as cold coffee for the non alcoholics. In starters i had sushi , prawns , maati murg , wasabi aloo tikki , smoked chicken cheese balls etc and all tasted great :) I didn't have the time to taste the main dishes n the deserts but with my short lived experience of this place I'm surely going to come here again.",Rated 4.0,10,44,??

Pranay Malik,"Rated Junk Junk Junk. There's junk everywhere around the resturant but you don't even realise it.The place is beautifully built and is humongous when it comes to size. I happened to be here for a friends birthday and the experience turned out to be pretty average which is definitely contrary to what I had expected when I stepped inside. What we ordered:Chill Chicken,Veg Nachos,Peri Peri Chicken Pizza,Four Seasons Veg Pizza, Chicken Tikka Brushchetta, Veg Brushchetta, Junkyard Special Burger,Honey Chilli Potato, Veg Mix Sauce Pasta Drinks:Minto Cool,Citrus Mart Hookah:Pan Kiwi Rose The Binging kicked off with the Honey chilli potato which was just fine and nothing great.The same was the case with the Chilli Chicken. The things which can be termed as good would be The Four Seasons Veg Pizza,The periperi Chicken pizza,The veg nachos and the mix sauce pasta. The things one can and should definitely avoid are The Veg Brushchetta and the biggest disappointment of the evening for me which was the The Veg Junkyard Special Burger.The burger was simply BAD. It lacked the taste, the juicyness which I expected it to have and trust me I am not going overboard if I compare it to a roadside burger worth 25 bucks which actually tastes better. This burger was bland, and was sticking inside the mouth. The only thing which I would suggest someone to try here would be the Chicken Tikka Brushchetta and the Mocktail which goes by the name of Minto Cool. The other Mocktail Citrus mart was just average. The Hookah here was another big disappointment. It did not have the flavor at all and whatever it did have was over in just 15 minutes when just 2 people were having it. So, basically whatever rating I have given here is mostly because of the ambience and also because I managed to have a good time along with my friends and definitely not the food. Food:2.5/5(Maybe we didn't order the right things) Ambience-10/5 (It takes your expectations to another level) Service- 2.5/5 The service was okayish.The burger took more than half an hour. The waiters were hesitant when I asked them to call the chef and even though the chef came he was of no help at all and was rather amazed as to why did I call him.Also I couldn't see a manager anywhere.

Karan Mishra,"Rated Just came back from the Halloween Night at Junkyard Cafe. The ambiance as expected is amazing. The thought and the amount of detailing that has been put behind the theme and decor is breathtaking. Its a huge place along with an outside seating area. The seating arrangement is well planned. Coming to food and drinks, in terms of quality and quantity both they score top points. The menu is huge and boasts of impressive dishes from various cuisines. The thin crust pizzas are very nice we had 2 and 2 cold mezze platter were impressive as well. Honey chili potatoes and chili chicken were equally good. The quantity is fulfilling. Mocktails are nicely done and my friends who had the liquor experience told me that the drinks are at a very affordable prices considering the competition which is a huge plus. They had 1.5 bottle of whisky(100 piper) and roughly 15 pints. Hookah was very good too. there were 7 of us and all this cost us 10.5 grands which came as a pleasant surprise because i was expecting it to be reasonably more than that. The DJ belted out impressive international music all night and not a single Hindi song which i personally find very satisfying. We already have too much Bollywood music going around in the city so this EDM culture is a nice change which i must admit is spreading and i hope it keeps on growing. All in all this is yet another gem right in the heart of this city. CP has reborn with these amazing places in the last few years and there are many more on the way. The ambiance, the decor, the food and the music, the staff, these are the 5 pillars of any place in the hospitality industry and Junkyard Cafe has the strongest 5 pillars, I hope they get stronger with time.

RAJEEV GULATI,"Rated It seldom happens that you go for the launch of a Night Caf / Lounge expecting a usual routine set up and get stunned right at the entrance, in fact at the staircase itself. Last time it happened to me was when I tasted Bira White Beer at their launch. I am talking about The Junkyard Caf at N Block Connaught Place. Situated at the 2nd Floor above The Town House, this 13000 sq. feet of mind-blowing restaurant needs your special attention to each and every detail. Everything inside the caf shouts about the hard work which went behind creating this concept caf mainly by putting Junk to Art. Umang Tewari & Umang Monga have painstakingly worked hard in to each and every detail, few of them you might not even notice on your initial few visits. So much so that they waited for 2 more months for the official opening of their restaurant even after receiving their liquor license just to finalize & finish the decor to their utmost satisfaction. They have made a Junkyard themed dedicated live entertainment stage / area keeping in mind the future entertainment events. The Bar at Junkyard Cafe, which is the most important part of a night club / caf is the brainchild of ace mixologist Viju Raj who has put his heart & soul besides his sleepless nights in creating not only a matching feel to Junkyard theme but also has churned out some very special drinks to match the rustic feel. Usually food takes a back seat on these type of restaurants as the main thrust is on drinks and ambiance with live events. I was surprised with the quality and taste of food which was top class. The service was fast & attentive despite the restaurant was filled to 4 to 5 times its guest accommodating capacity. We tasted Veg Salt & Pepper, Falafel, Paneer Tikka in Vegetarian and Sesame Chicken, Amritsari Chicken Tikka, Fish Tikka etc in Non-Veg. Besides, there was Sushi platter with Veg & Non Veg offerings.

We ordered Steamed Momos, Redwine, Honeychilly potatoaes, White sauce pasta and Baked nachos and everything tasted really good!plus the bill was also not a hole in the pocket.Staff was courteous enough to cater our needs on time and the service was really amazing.we didn't had to wait for too long and even if you have to wait the decor has been done so beautifully that if you take a look at it keenly,your waiting time will pass within no time! ;)So if you are always eager to try something new and worth your money.This is the place for you. :)",Rated 5.0,18,263,??

Mannu Kaushik,"Rated Well Junkyard Cafe has undoubtedly best interior decors in c.p, the effort shows in every detail of the restaurant. From the glass bottled roof to a complete sitting section made out of junk mother boards. Old stuff well utilized. FOOD: Now coming to the food, we didn't want to experiment with our food. So we chose to order basic such as Falafel, Bhatti da chicken etc. , I must appreciate the chefs who really made sure the best dishes go out of their kitchen and presentation was really well. Drink: The major drawback at this point is their Bar menu, NO HAPPY HOUR :( and they don't serve many popular beers such as Carlsberg or Budwieser and whatever they have is slightly expensive then what you would usually find in Beer Cafe or Tap treat. Most of the hard drinks were not available and although they have some nice cocktail mixes. Music: Work on Music as well. Service: On time service and Enough servers to handle peak hour crowd, for yesterday's low turnout they were a little extra. Sheesha is available in basic flavors and it's a tall one, which is a little uncomfortable to handle in low seating. But since it was their first day yesterday, I would really hope they take a look at the feedback and quickly become the busiest joint. Recommendation: If you like trying new restaurants in c.p, it can turn out to be a good option and great visual experience. Here the competition is way higher than any other blocks in c.p., as N block is already packed with Blues, Pebble Street, Amber etc.",Rated 3.5,1,0,??
Akshay Gupta,"Rated Food- Amazing food. Creative presentation, Chicken brochettes were amazing, so was chicken tikka. Veg was also nice, and their peanut sauce is amazing, Though I hate taste of peanut I loved this. Drinks- Are decently price, Even some drinks are very well presented. And they also have cap drinks in which one has to wear a cap and a straw comes out of it. Service- Nice, Staff had this interesting dress code, which really lifted the whole feel of the place. MUST GO",Rated 5.0,4,0,??
Akanksha Sharma,"Rated This place is fantastic.They have created such unique stuff out of all scrap.ambience is amazing.its a huge spacious place.seating is very comfortable.its quite exciting to look at all the interesting stuff they have put up all around. Food-let's just say each and everything we ordered was great.we ordered the four seasons pizza, Piri Piri pasta, aloo bhujia onion rings and falafel.they put a great effort in presenting an authentic cuisine forward.pizza was light and thin crust.pasta was comparable to big chill. Drinks-the cocktails would be my favorite part.the presentation is super exciting.we ordered the edision bulb #1 and #3.both were very good and I loved the 3rd one.also tried the metallic blender.it has a very fresh spicy clove based taste which was very unique. Alcohol is affordable.we ended up ordering 24 pints of beer. Management- thumbs up to the staff.very polite and welcoming.they recommended the dishes which ended up being very good.the manager was polite to visit us a few times to make sure we don't need anything else.such a refreshing change compared to the pathetic management at vault cafe.i really hope they maintain this always even when this place becomes a hit. This place is a must must visit.full marks",Rated 5.0,11,4,??
Tarun,"Rated The Junkyard Cafe - What a Unique Name...What a New Concept & What a Unique Place...IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT... Amazing Ambiance with a Retro Look was Just Awesome....No one can ever imagine that old tyres and glass bottles can create such an amazing feel to a Cafe. But the Showstopper of the Cafe was an Aircraft hanging from the Ceiling. The Junkyard Cafe being a very spacious outlet can easily accommodate 400+ people in their lounge & terrace zones. In the heart of the cafe they have Created a platform for Gigs, Musical nights and a DJ setup. Also The Molecular Bar had a MishMash of never ending liquor. Baba Bhukkhad's favourite Topic - IT'S FOOD TIME "" Mujhe bahut bhook lagi hai khaana do ' Yeh kya hai ? Sushi......hmm....it was really mouth watering & yummy. Chilli Chicken & Chicken Pizza were very Juicy and Spicy just Perfect.... Aur End mein Baba Bhukkhad ka Favourite Fal...........Falafal...... Bhai dekh agar Jannat hai to issi Junkyard Cafe mein hai. Abhi ke liye Itna kaafi hai ......milte hai Break ke Baad. Baba Bhukkhad :)",Rated 4.0,3,105,??
