Devansh Kamboj,"Rated How would you feel , when you go at a restaurant with your friends , see the menu , the prices are hiked up a lot and when you order they just give you 3-4 small pieces of each item ? Disgusting ! Thats my experiences of the stupid place , firstly they try to impress with an ambience of something like stock market area where you see prices of the drinks being increased or decreased constantly. The staff was not at all helping . We ordered pizza , spring rolls , panner tikka , hukka and some mock-tails . The spring rolls were Priced at 295/- i guess and what you get are just 4 small pieces of it . Panner tikka was just bot enough for 1 person , the hukka that was pathetic was prices at 999/- the only thing good was the pizza . Even The mock-tails were not satisfactory . I ordered a wolf punch cocktail first and they handed me a tea cup filled with vodka and some other liquids , i argued and got it changed with a mojito . And when my total bill was summed upto 3k , for some Food and ambience like this i wouldnt pay a dime . Worst experience ever . The name should be f***ed up street .",Rated 1.5,34,260,??

Went there for valentine day after getting a confirmed reservation done by zomato but had to fight to get in since our booking was not mentioned in their record Decor - Very basic, I didn't find the stock exchange theme depicted very nicely, looking at the screen for the changing prices of the drinks is very tiring Food We ordered a beer & 'bankruptcy' drink The bankruptcy costs around 1k per glass but its the most awful tasting drink I have ever tried, morever it just had like 5 sips of drink in the glass rest it was filled with ice...most disappointing The food (jalapeo poppers & 3 cheese pizza) were OK...they were served cold hence no taste Service Another major disappointment, was served food without the cutlery, had to ask for a fork trice, The staff looked extremely overworked & confused. And as a cherry on the cake, our bill was overcharged by an extra beer, had to show the server the number of bottles on our table Overall, a very disastrous evening Tip - Try not to go there at all, give it a miss",Rated 1.0,16,73,??

Shayak Victor Munshi,"Rated So we went on pre valentines bash yesterday with my 3 friends.Initially we had a problem In getting a place to sit as the guy on phone didn't register our name when we called in the evening to get a reserved sit.So there goes one point. 1.) To start with we had a chicken tikka and it was yummy and perfect on spice level,neither fiery nor bland so perfect and nicely marinated and not burnt or overdone.It was really yummy!!! 2.) Apart from this we also ordered Galouti Kebab which was super soft,melt in mouth and perfect blend of spices.Only the potato slice on base was too cold and bit hard so there I deducted another point but rest was all fine. 3.) Lastly the Kadai Chicken and Afghani chicken was really amazing and lip smacking.Very tasty and Yummy.The Afghani chicken was very creamy and soft loved it.The Kadai Chicken had small bits of chicken which was a hit disappointing and stir fried bell pepper in soya sauce which was average in taste but presented well. The speed of service was good and satisfactory.The DJ played all good nos from remixed trances to EDM's to the lovely Punjabi and Bollywood nos.The interior decors are also good specially the old cylindrical bulbs give a retro look.Overall a nice place to spend your weekend and enjoy.So might turn up again here again.",Rated 4.0,39,274,??
Harsh Chandarana,"Rated The same concept like Bar Stock Exhange (BSE) in Mumbai. Pretty chill place with lovely Music playing. The place seems to be divided into 2 sections, one near the DJ and the other on a complete opposite side where it is a bit quite. Went there on a weekday, seemed quite empty. Service was very slow. Had a Paneer chilli dry, veg finger. Taste has been modified to suit the North Indian pallette which is good in a way. Ambience is good to chill and hangout with friends.",Rated 3.5,48,133,??
Deeksha Sabharwal,"Rated Visited this place recently for an office party. A nice ambience, super quick bar tenders and a huge dance area. But what disappointed me was the food, which was not really up to the mark. The food lacked flavor or maybe it was an office party and they never bothered to serve there best. But what I really liked was the way they displayed all the cocktail prices. Innovative that was! All in all one can give this place a shot.",Rated 3.5,43,89,??
Gaurav Prakash,"Rated So, i went to Cafe Dalal Street on 30th December'2015 with a friend. We had heard a lot of good things and how this is the new Bar stock exchange kind of a place. We were excited. So, we finished up our coffee at Starbucks and went on to find this place. Now, GPS might try and confuse you. But, don't lose hope. We entered the place and we did start to like it from the beginning. Interiors and Ambiance : The place is really well done and well crafted when it comes to Interiors and it boasts of ample seating space in various forms. We took a table in front of the bar and the DJ space. The place is nicely lit up and has enough places you can click pictures with. The cafe also has a magnanimous Bar and the ticker which shows the alcoholic drinks prices. Crew : The crew is not very courteous and is highly unaware of the menu. We asked a few questions only to be left on ourselves to decide on dishes and even when i raised a query on the pathetic burger i was server, i was not heard. So, yep! Food : Coming to the main part, the food is average. Just average. For a bill of 2078, the satisfaction, quality and quantity was not the worth as i would like to expect. We ordered the following: 1. Five spiced Asian Fish : Decent. Soft. Quantity too low. 2. Sushi Nv : I did not taste it. My friend did. And he said it was okayish. Nothing Extra ordinary. 3. Chicken Steak burger : This piece of soggy crap is not even worth 100 rupees let alone 325+ taxes. Badly made, hard chicken and soggy bread. Worst burger i have had in ages. 4. Ginger punch: Decent ginger drink. Refreshing and worth the price. Overall, Not a place i'd like to go again. Too pricy. Quality not upto the mark The place is open till 1am. And you can sit back till then. The only positive Overall 3.5/5",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Sunileo,"Rated For all the hype, when I visited the place on a Saturday between 9-11, the place was quiet empty and the music wasn't great. However, I was told that the music is generally good otherwise. Food and the quantity was good. All dishes were reasonably priced too. The best part of the place is the ever changing prices on their app and the monitors, to give the stock exchange feel. Going in groups can be fun and choosing out the menu is quiet playful and interesting.",Rated 3.5,64,163,??
Vickrham (Vicky),"Rated One more cafe in CP.Is that a news ?? Or just a passe....No this time it's not just any cafe but a stock exchange concept Bar. A live ticker runs everywhere inside the cafe displaying the fluctuating rates of different alcoholic drinks. Fluctuation is around 15-20 bucks , so for me it wis just a gimmick to attract people and be different from others. The ambience is not very modern but resembles to that of an old stock exchange where iron tables and benches were used. Nicely stocked up Bar with a special dance area just next to an elevated DJ and Gig spot. Coming to food and drinks we tried their signature cocktails such as Sour connection and Bankruptcy. Former being whisky based with cinnamon and latter a Gun based concoction. Served very uniquely in a Brass lamppost with dry ice smoke. Now the food , we tried the Butter chicken Golgappas yes you hear it right ; they were nice. Fish Tikka Ajwaini, Chicken tikka and also the Other grilled stuff including vegetarian. I really liked them all.The salad like the Caesar was just fine but the other salad poached fruit salad was not at all justified with its name.The Minestrone soup was awesome. They have named the Soups as Stock and Salads as Opening Bells so the Mains have been named as Large caps.Sounding so stock exchange like. I also tried the Stuffed mushrooms grilled and the Pan fried dumplings which were too good. Finally for the mains we tried the Mushroom Risotto and a grilled fish. Both dishes were done nicely. For the desserts a must have is the Kesar Phirni and the Churros. They have a Corporate lunch offer running too around 500 bucks too. Overall a nice and happening place with decent food, great service. Music can be improvised as I could hear to songs which are very much done and dusted in the last 10-15 years. Lighting can also be a bit more bright than it is now....

Disha,Rated Worst worst worst Went there with family. My grandmother went as well so we asked them if they have lift as she couldn't climb the stairs. They agreed and said lift is bit slow. But when she entered the lift stopped in between and she was stuck for 10 mins. The staff was so pathetic nobody came for help and were not even sorry for the problem. Also the Music was so loud that nobody could hear us and we really couldn't make out that shes stuck.Really disappointing.,Rated 1.0,77,63,??
Sandy,"Rated Its when ordinary people rise above the expectations and seize the opportunity, milestones are truly reached In the past year or so; disappointingly; CP had become a market full of clones. Warehouse, townhouse, openhouse not only were all the places beginning to sound like each other but one quick glance at their menus and youll realize that the similarity ran way way deeper. Though this does not take anything away from the fact that these places are good too; but for me, there was barely any difference in the dining experiences these places were being able to provide. & familiarity is something that bores the bejesus outta me! Just when innovation seemed to be dying a slow, painful death came a place that is hell bent on marking its stamp of authenticity in every category you can think of. Whether it is their dishes or their drinks or concept, everything, and I mean EVERYTHING has something unique about it that will make you connect the dots to Caf Dalal Street as soon as you hear its mention. Before visiting the place, I was quite curious to know as to what value addition a menu being flashed on TV instead of a regular one will do. Infact the very thought of shuttling your attention between the food and TV seemed too cumbersome to me. But after visiting the place, I now know, what it brings to the table instead is exhilaration. Pure, unadulterated, on the rocks exhilaration! The likes of which we feel while watching those last ball finishes during India Pakistan cricket matches. Located in the outer circle of CP, M block to be precise, the place is at a stones throw away from the rajiv chowk metro station. Their signboard in itself is one of the catchiest one youll ever see with the rupees sign replacing the R and their logo being a trader with horns of bull and nose of a bear (what an amazingly clever reference to their inspiration the stock exchange and the famous terms associated with it). The references doesnt end there, as youll notice them in almost every nook & corner of the place, whether it is in the form of signages or quirky posters or an entire wall in one corner wherein theyve an protruding artwork depicting a traders life. They even have a replica of the original dalal street (in Mumbai) signboard to enhance the feel of the place. But NOTHING compares to the highlight of the place TVs hung all around, showcasing the rise and fall in the prices of the drinks. Its great fun to see them fluctuate based on their demand , making for some light moments wherein you get to taunt your friends choices in case their drinks prices take a hit :D Since we had a teetotaller with us for a change so a peru was ordered for him swiftly before we got down to deciding whatd be our poison for the night. The pic of the cocktail; Bankruptcy; in the menu, decided one half of the order while the description of zombie street took care of the rest. Like I mentioned before, the innovation doesnt end at this caf with the concept, it begins with it. The drink Bankruptcy is one such thing that carries the torch forward. Beautifully presented in a lantern with smoke oozing out of it, it was by far one of the most delicious & headiest cocktail Ive tasted so far. The potency of the drink, though, hardly came as a surprise considering the use of ingredients like monkey shoulder (whiskey esp. used for cocktails), maraschino, vermouth and Bombay gin. Committed the crime of gulping it too fast owing to its great taste and paid bigtime for it as it had me ringing all through the round of starters. The presentation of the second drink again bowled us over. Served in a container that looked straight out of some Aztec museum, the zombie street, comprising of orange & pineapple in rum, was another drink that wowed us with both its execution and presentation. In the second round of drinks, we ordered for dutch investment, wolf punch and thai mojito alongwith couple of shakes mixed berries and banana honey & nuts. It was amazing to see such command over such a myriad order of drinks as ALL the drinks were just too good. Having heard great many things about their golgappe, it was a dish ordered for even before opening the menu. Alongside it were ordered jalapeno poppers and tandoori mushroom. Jalapeno poppers were served in a manner most places serve philadelphia cheese rolls the cigar style. The rolls were placed in shots glasses which had salsa at its bottom. Personally I found this manner more fine dine quality in terms of appearance as well as high on convenience for consumption than those small hemispherical pieces most restaurants go for. While the tandoori mushroom went the tried and tested way in terms of presentation as well as taste, it was sheer brilliance, coming up with an idea as unique as tawa paneer golgappe. Almost a decade after its transition from being a street food to one used in bars to deliver shots, a new angle has been added to golgappes versatility by serving them with shahi paneer curry and mixture of cottage cheese with onion & mint for filling. Its an absolutely 100% must have here, Period! For mains, we had their soy burger and grilled cottage cheese steak, which was then followed by veg. noodles to finish off the lil niggling hunger we had left despite having all that delicacy. As is the trend now-a-days, the potato-soya patty burger was huge and served alongwith salad & fries, was a complete meal on its own. Grilled cottage cheese steak has become my new fav. for mains for past few months now and the taste of the dish here further intensified our budding romance. Though not someone with much of a sweet tooth, still decided to go for their kesar firni, churros and blueberry cheesecake, as I just dint wanted my food journey here to end. Attuned to the desires of todays nit picky diners, all the desserts had mild sweetness to them except ofcourse the churros which were in their full sugary glory. Already witnessing packed tables, barely months since its inception, the success of the place is a testimony to the fact that people are fed up with CP clones and are craving for new experiences and believe me, there aint none fresher or more amazing than Caf Dalal Street. A must MusT MUST VISIT place!!!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Also they give you free shots of JD for some silly game you play on a tab (which they make sure you win). Let's get into the details.

Sahil Arora,Rated Cafe Dalal Street is the first exchange bar in Delhi where the drink prices change according to the demand of the drinks. We visited it on a Saturday night and surprisingly we got a table without a reservation but i must suggest a prior reservation cos it gts pretty busy on the weekends. The concept of it is that they have a screen over every table displaying the drink prices in a loop which are refreshed as the price of drink changes. Although it does take a toll on ur neck while u are keeping a lookout at the prices. Jst a suggestion the drink prices dont fluctuate mch so u cn avoid the constant stare at the screen.

Just Delhiing,"Rated Looking for place where you can drink without burning a hole in your pocket? And which also serves delicious bar bites? Then, my friend, this newbie in CP is the place to be. What is very unique about the place is that it is conceptualised on the lines of our infamous stock exchanges,wherein the drink prices change based on demand and supply. The place is very spacious and has been tastefully done. They also have a dance floor which is great for parties and the food here is delicious! Isn't it a perfect place to chill? Coming to what we had there : 1. Veg platter : The colourful platter had mouthwatering kebabs right from dahi kebabs to chana kababs served with tangy sauce and a mint chutney. 2. Jalapeo poppers : The jalapeo poppers served at this place are so irresistible that you just cannot eat one! These were deep fried, filled with goey cream cheese and cheddar cheese and dipped in zingy salsa sauce. 3. Tawa Paneer Gol Gappe : What a lovely combination of gol gappe with cottage cheese, gravy and onions. The crunchiness of gol gappe with the comforting cottage cheese and gravy will leave you wanting for more! 4. Khao Sui : A northern Thai soup with surprising depth of flavours. 5. Sushi : They have a variety of options in Veg but somehow we were not very impressed with the flavour and texture. 6. Tequila Rose : This is a must have!

We ordered Minestrone soup which was not that nice. We ordered Lasagna which was tasty and cheesy,met expectations and was worth it. We even ordered veg dumplings, which was full of chopped vegetables and was spicy. We ordered honey chilly potato which was served with spring onions, potatoes were too crispy. After having all these we went for some fruits and ordered ""Poached fruit salad"". More that fruits salad, it was lettuce salad. Disappointed with fruit salad.

Meenakshi Srivastav,"Rated This cafe in CP simulating the Stock exchange theme of BSE is definitely a new place to pop in and have some boozie fun. It reminds you of the stock exchange monitors displaying oft-fluctuating share prices. Well its all about the changing prices of beverages owing to demand-supply fluctuations inside the bar. All good drinks and cocktails are served here. Huge place with nicely decorated interiors. My personal experience says that the prices displayed on screen did not fluctuate by a significant amount, so it doesnt satisfy the thrill of grabbing some pocket saving deals. The place reminds me of The Bar Stock Exchange of Mumbai...quite similar theme. The food has a faily wide range including Chinese, Mexican, North Indian,Spanish, Lebanese, Italian, Thai cuisines. Among Cocktails, Zombie Street and Wolf punch are must try things. I personally feel girls would prefer Choclate Martini. All sorts and brands of blended scotch and beer are available and well-served. We tried the famous ""Butter Chicken Golgappe"" which tasted great. After having some Oven-fried Chicken Fingers with drinks and cocktails, we ordered BSE Chicken Platter and relished every bite of it. Overall good experience.

ABHAY SANGAL,"Rated They claim being the first Bar Stock Exchange in Delhi but they highly disappoint. The drinks' prices fluctuate in a bracket of only 10-15rs not really making a difference. Half the food & drinks items I had asked from we're not available. Had already pre-booked a table from Zomato & when I reached there, half the tables were empty & still they gave us the worst one available, which we insisted strongly to be changed. The inside seating, although vast is highly suffocating. They really need to re-arrange the tables to utilise the space better. An overall below average experience that won't really bring me back to this place again!",Rated 2.0,38,26,??
Suhael Buttan,"Rated A concept which is similar to that of the bar exchange in Mumbai and bulldogs in hkv where the alcohol prices keep on fluctuating like the stock prices. They have screens displaying the prices near almost every table and also have an app from which you can monitor the prices and order( very nice and a unique concept). The app works smoothly with no glitches as such. The ambience is a bit too dark and dingy though. Since I was there for a for barely an hour, I couldn't try much of the dishes.",Rated 3.5,29,128,??
Siddharth Jain,"Rated Was here for my birthday party for a group of 12 and l had a mixed experience. Some things were worth appreciating and some were a total bummer. Drinks: 5/5... No dilution done by the bar. LIIT is worth trying. Very Limited(two) flavours for Breezers though but i guess that doesn't really count. Food: 2.5/5... Paneer tikka, Four cheese Pizza were really awesome. The only thing wrong with hara Bhara kebab, Dahi ke kebab & Tandoori platter was that it just melts in mouth which sometimes gives you an impression that it isn't cooked enough. Kebabs should be crispy atleast on outside. Sheesha: 4/5... Good enough. Costly as cheapest small one will cost you 1100 after taxes. Service: 5/5... Nothing to say about it. It was as expected. Prices: The concept of fluctuation in prices is Cool but cool only for 5 mins. It is really frustrating to order drinks while watching a screen which shows only few options at a time. I highly recommend to DOWNLOAD there application in advance for easy access to the prices and options. Food prices are very reasonable because serving size is small. Prices are much much lower till around 5 PM. The thing i hated the most was the music. They had a predefined playlist of ambient music which they dont change on any kind of request. We didn't asked them to play hindi music if that hurts their status. We only asked to change it to some hip-hop or edm music. They were polite but didn't changed the music to set a party mood. This was the biggest bummer. A misunderstanding in billing was dealt very professionally by Mr Ajay. The place is very well lit. I will totally recommend this place. It is very reasonable during lunch timings but do download their App and do confirm about the music or Dj theme being played prior to your visit.",Rated 3.5,9,33,??
FOODSTER,"Rated Caf Dalal street, located in the outer circle of C.P is Delhis first Bar Exchange, The concept of fluctuating prices of the drinks in accordance with the demand. We were 2 couples who visited this place on a Saturday night which was jam packed. The server was still quick and handed over an elaborate menu, and recommended we try some of their signature cocktails. We had THE SOUR CONNECTION, which was a blend of whiskey topped with a cinnamon stick and a liquor soaked cherry as a garnish. We also tried THE BANKRUPCY, a mix of Bombay sapphire gin and vermouth, presented in a brass lantern with dry ice smoke oozing out of the lantern. From the food menu, BUTTER CHICKEN GOL GAPPE was something which instantly attracts your attention, and we had to order that. The dish was superbly executed. NON VEG MEZZE PLATTER was huge and super delicious too. CHICKEN BURGER was nicely assembled and decent too. MALAYSIAN CHICKEN SATAY, was glazed with rich peanut sauce which too was enjoyed. The portion sizes were excellent and we had to skip the deserts. Caf Dalal Street is not only a very well executed concept but also delights you with the outstanding food and beverages it has.

Vaibhav Aggarwal,"Rated The ambience of the place is quite so-so. We were a large group, for which they didn't have good seating, despite a reservation, such that everyone could chat properly also. When I entered, they had live music on with an artist who was singing as well as playing the guitar alongside. That was quite nice. The DJ, which started a while later, wasn't quite fun, but it was decent. Their USP, which is the stock prices type fluctuation in the prices of booze, isn't made quite fun, and the fluctuations also aren't much (this is despite me not drinking). To eat we tried their Malaysian Chicken Satay, Chicken Malai Tikka, Pepperoni Pizza, Four Cheese Pizza, Chicken Tikka Pizza, Lamb Kaftas and Non-Veg Mezze Platter. To drink, I had their Chocolate Shake (they didn't have their Snicker and Vanilla Shake available). The Malai Tikka was nice; the Satay, almost so. The Lamb Kaftas, shake and Mezze Platter were decent. All the pizzas were quite disappointing, with overloaded ketchup, weirdly placed toppings too. Service was decent. Staff was quite responsive.

Eat Style Shop,"Rated I went to Dalal Street after hearing a lot about the concept on a Saturday night. The outside board seems pretty cool and bright. The location on the outer circle makes it a little easier to find amongst other restaurants in connaught place. The concept of this restaurant is the prices of the drinks fall and raise like a live stock market. It's quite cool but to my surprise the execution of this concept doesn't really happen. There have been a few bars with a similar concept before ( Charlie's Bar Exchange in Saket) and they were pretty cool when it comes to implementing the concept. The minute I entered, I saw numbers dwindling on a screen. The ambience was like any other club- drunk girls on the dance floor, a photographer running behind them drinks and men tripping on ""nikke nikle shots"" except for an LCD screen fixed above every table. I wasn't a fan of the ambience even though they have tried to be different. Anyhow, coming down to food. What we ate: A four cheese pizza, nachos and some mushroom cheese poppers. The pizza was okay, not great. It was a thing crust and the cheese was quite decently put. The worst thing to happen was the service... The waiters just didn't come to give us any seasonings or even sauce. The nachos were tasty but the salsa sauce was actually a mix of ketchup and some tomatoes. The poppers were okay, because there couldn't be much wrong with them anyway. What we drank: A whiskey sour, some whisky and a daiquiri classic cocktail. The whiskey sour was well made but the daiquiri was not up to or even close to the mark. Again, my main problem here was the service which wasn't efficient at all. Waiting time was too long. We sat in the smoking section, which according to my observations is done up the best. What we paid: 2300 for three people, I wouldn't go again because of bad service, not so awesome food and the price points of the drinks not being even close to as exciting as they promise to be. The concept of the bar is flawed and the waiter takes your order without having system where he punches in your order right at the time you placed it. He goes to his counter and enter it, by which time the prices aren't the same obviously. A tad disappointed with this restaurant.

So the affordable food price comes only with small servings. And it costs more than 1000 for two, not keeping in respect our own order. Pizza was decent.

Rohini Gauba,"Rated We all are aware of the scenarios the stock market face every day and how crucial situations are overcome by the investors. Whenever the stock market crashes, numerous stocks are bought are bought and sold. So, is the case with Dalal Street. As the name suggests, the concept might be new in Delhi but many people have witnessed such a scenario in Gurgaon. Its not too late yet. Dalal Street is situated in the Outer Circle in the heart of Delhi. The ambiance might not be that alluring but the food certainly is. The place is a setup of various kinds of seating; booths, couches and normal cushioned chairs. The place is a bit congested, seems that more furniture was tried to fit inside. We were a group of nine people who were crazily hungry. After looking at the app on their phone, the guys ordered Kingfisher Beer at 62 bucks, as the price had gone down for a minute. You can see the real time changes on the screens right next to your tables. I ordered a Snickers & Vanilla Shake which was not available, slightly disappointing. Inturn, I ordered a Peanut & Banana Shake but was served a Peanut & Banana Smoothie. After a clarification, I was assured that it was a shake but I could clearly taste the yoghurt. I decided to keep quite after the incident. Butter Chicken Golgappas: 5 pieces of ready to fry golgappas, served with chopped Tandoori Chicken and Butter Chicken gravy. Innovative. Please give it a try. Chicken Tikka Pizza: The pizza was literally loaded with cheese. It disappeared in no time. Totally worth the money paid. Honey Chilly Potato: Not happy with the quantity. Pastas: Same as every places pasta. Dahi Kebabs: 6 pieces served in one portion, loved the hung-curd filling. Would have preferred them a little crunchy on the outside though. We paid close to 9k for 9 people where people had been drinking like a fish. The price fluctuations will surely work for people who are here to drink. The concept should be given a chance atleast once. Happy Eating!!",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Samrat Chakravorty,"Rated Seldom I have been to places where I have had experiences in extreme both negative and positive the same day. Whenever I am exploring a bar alone I prefer sitting at the bar stool. Gives me a complete view of the place. Well for a place so posh, you have extremely uncomfortable bar stools. The place has too many waiters, 2% of them are professionals and remaining have no idea what's going on, are untrained and talk in abuses to each other right beside customers. When after 5 mins nobody came to ask for order I was planning to leave when a very well groomed guy ( who later turned out to be the DJ ) directed waiters towards me. Scanning the prices was a neck spraining task, I ordered beers and starters. The food again was a mix experience. The oven fried chicken fingers were delightful. The Malaysian satay chicken was a big disappointment. It felt like chicken pieces taken out of a Thai curry and coated with a curious sauce which was neither mustard nor chilli. The pepperoni pizza again was amazing. After the first starter and beer I had planned to leave. The place seemed ok, nothing special. Really loved the style of Jukebox, but the place was too brightly lit to be a bar. It was then that the DJ took over, the lights suddenly got dimmed, and by the end of first song I decided to spend the evening there. Your DJ Adi, is a keeper. I have heard pen drive DJs all over Delhi but this was an artist. Seamlessly mixing Hindi, English and Sufi, creating amazing fusions and living the music. Every pub offers almost same drinks and food, what makes them special making people want to back is the ambience. And I am definitely coming back here for the music. Suggestions: you have so many screens displaying the prices, a couple more showing some soundless sports channel will cut the monotony. Pricing: the entire evening I noticed the screens kept displaying two different prices for Heineken, it was very late when I saw the bottom ticker I realized one of them should have been Budweiser, which was conveniently missing from main screen prices all evening. This got very well reflected in my bill too. I asked for the floor manager a couple of times to inquire and rectify but apperantly he was too busy. If it was human error please look into it, else if it was stock pricing ploy than certainly not appreciated. Overall thank you CDS for a wonderful evening.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Deep,"Rated Cafe dalal street as the name suggests comes with the concept of stock exchange where the prices of drinks vary from time to time during the day. But what makes this place better than its competitors having the same concept, is the originality and fusion in their food menu. The ambience is classy, a variety of seating options and a dance floor with a dj. It has all the right components to be the best bar in CP but it sadly lacks in service. Like, what is the use of fluctuating drink rates if there is no one to take an order at that particular moment. The place was indeed full when I went there and many guests were complaining about the service, so I just hope that they improve it with time. Coming to the drinks, I had an elminator pitcher called Tumse na ho payega. The cocktail was indeed strong but a heavy drinker like me gulped it within minutes. It tasted like LIIT but with energy drink which was strong enough to make an elephant tipsy. No wonder I stuck to scotch after that. Now coming to the food, this place has it.. which most pubs lack in that area. Every dish was unique and made with perfection if we can just make an exception for the sushi platter which was quite average. Butter chicken gol gappas were very delicious and according to me were the star of their menu, with butter chicken sauce, mint and fine chunks of pulled tandoori chicken. Their teriyaki lamb burger was another highlight with a massive portion of well marinated lamb. If you are still hungry and unsatisfied after this, then you my friend, definitely belong to another species. The butter garlic prawns were excellent and thanks to the chef that they were not overdone. The tacos with different fillings played the role of a great appetizer with numerous flavours and cheese oozing out with every bite. The biryani was good, but not something I would add to the list of must haves. Sadly I had no room left for the dessert, but my co foodie was in love with the churros. The music was good and we did hit the dance floor for a while. On a whole, I had an amazing evening. This place is definitely going to be the best in the area if they maintain the quality and pay more attention on their service. I hope my next visit forces me to give it a higher rating. Recommended!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Chandni Kumar,"Rated The most interesting element about this place is the way they have designed the concept of bar stock exchange. The menu gives you a preview of what's in store for you. They have screen's placed all over the cafe.. where based on demand and supply of the drinks/beverages ordered, the prices fluctuate by either going up or on a discounted price. To top it up they have an app through which you can place your order and feed in your table no. So that the server can check when you placed an order. Everyday twice the market crashes, by market crash I mean all drinks are available at dirt cheap prices. There is no fixed time for the market crash! Their Chef : I've added his picture specializes in Italian Food. Veg Food: 1. The hara bhara kebabs were so soft that they melted in my mouth. They tasted fresh and we're so tasty that I confess of finishing the full plate to myself. It's yummmy! 2.The veg sushi platter is a must have. Each one of it tasted so well. ( I'm defiantly coming back to eat this again). 3.Jalapeo poppers - the only place in Delhi where I tried the non-frozen jalapeo poppers. It was freshly prepared served in shot glasses that had a salsa base. (even if you are a non vegetarian - this is a must try) 4. In pizza you have to try the four cheese pizza - it's yum! Non veg Food: 1.The galauti kebabs could have been better. I've tasted better ones at other cafe's. You can do without this dish. Trust me they have better options than this. 2.On request the server got us a four in one thin crust pizza ( be kind and request them to make you one ) - my favourite in taste was the meat lover pizza as it was loaded with chicken and cheese, just as I like. 3. The wasabi prawn tempura is something new on the platter as the wasabi is mixed with mayo and the taste is not very pungent. It's very mild and full of flavour. 4.The butter chicken golguppas is a new twist to street food. (it's a must try). 5.Teriyaki lamb burger comes with a portion of fries. The burger patty is soft and the outer crust is crisp, the teriyaki they use does the magic,that you keep digging in till the last bite. For Sheesha : They boost about their AK47 Sheesha .. but it does not have much smoke.. I recommend you to order the regular Sheesha. They have a good variety of flavours to offer. My personal favourite these days is: 1.Grape , Orange, Peach Mix 2.Brain freezer, Orange and Grape mix. For Drinks: 1.My new favourite - Jack 7 in heaven (You have to try this cocktail, it's so refreshing and yummy, that you'll keep wanting it over an over again) 2. The dutch investment is a very strong drunk to start the evening/night. -if you like it strong you should try this. 3. The bankrupsy - Indeed the most expensive drink on the menu and is served in a fancy lantern concept. - the drink has no taste .. it only tastes like drinking neat alcohol. For straight drinkers - one serving of this cocktail mix can keep u buzzing for the rest of the night. 4. The white wine zing spritzer- the name sounds quite fancy but it tastes horrible. I left this drink after a sip. Shots: You need to try their Tequila Rose! ( It's unreal how they can manage to have a shot that does not burn your throat) - my favourite again! Desserts: 1. My personal favourite was the churros. The best part of this dessert was that churros were crispy and crunchy and the cinnamon did not over power the bread. An icing on top was the white chocolate they served us on the side. ( you have to try this) 2. The tiramisu - honestly I was more stuck on the churros, and I found the tiramisu to be okish. Not something I'll be going gaga about.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Like other pubs, their food menu is mostly limited to the usual pizza, fries, and pasta and like the rest they taste quite awful. Thought this place seemed to have excess of staff, the service was mind numbingly slow. The waiter took almost half an hour just to get our drinks (a baileys, a Diet Coke, and a lime soda).

Geetika Srivastava,"Rated If you're looking for a place with delicious food without burning a big fat hole in your pocket (like most other outlets in CP), this is it. We ordered BBQ chicken wings, Honey Chilli Potatoes, and an oriental platter which consisted of noodles with chicken in hot garlic sauce. BBQ chicken wings- Chicken wings were surprisingly good, I've seen few places make it this way. They were tangy, juicy and had a great sauce. Honey Chilli Potatoes - The Potatoes were delicious, a perfect combination of crispy sweet and tangy. If I have to complain anywhere, I'd say the quantity was a little less but all else was good. Oriental Platter- The hot garlic sauce was a recommendation of the server, and was it good. I loved it! The noodles were perfectly made, weren't too oily or spicy, and perfect amount of thin. This wasn't a disappointmemt. Drinks - We didn't order any cocktail or mocktail, just 2 regular cokes (which were not exorbitantly priced unlike many other joints -sold on MRP!) Ambience was really nice. I'd say this is a really good place to hang out with friends. The bar looked pretty good too, they have all kinds of liquor under the roof. They also serve hookah. Service was super fast. Food came hot and fresh but didn't take too long. Our server was super friendly and paid a lot of attention to our table. I'm definitely visiting this place again!

Rishabh Bahl,"Rated A rather underwhelming experience. The food was just plain bad and the service too. However the ambience was somewhat okayish, but nothing out of the ordinary. The whole concept was to create the spatial design of a ""dalal street"" but going by that order, the decor seemed uninspiring, unamusing and clichd. Good thing was that menu has a lot of dishes and drinks on it. They'd do better with a chef who knows how to cook. All in all, yet another clichd & boring cafe in CP.",Rated 1.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Varun Gupta,"Rated On the Christmas Eve I along with a close friend decided to go to cafe 1 boulevard only to discover cafe Dalal street, so we went inside. It is one of a kind of cafe with Bar stock Exchange concept. So LEDs are placed on every table and rates of the drinks fluctuates as the demand goes up and high. It might make a little difference while ordering your fav beer but not for high end. I ordered Jack Daniels and Double black but end paying the bill on a higher end. Ambience is average with decent sitting options.one of the USP of the cafe is the DJ kudos for the best of the Bollywood retro. Had fun dancing. Outdoor Smoking zone is a miss.

Simran Dhaliwal,"Rated Cafe Dalal Street is the place to go if you just want to have some drinks at a pocket friendly price. Based on the modus operandi of Mumbai stock exchange, here the price of drinks fluctuates in accordance to the demand. CDS has screens where one can see the prices of drinks going up and down and then order at best prices. You can also download their app. More the demand of the drink, higher the prices. Though the prices were not fluctuating much but the concept definitely made it interesting. A kingfisher pint costed us between Rs 64- Rs70. The Sangria was priced at Rs 350 but wasnt worth it. In this weather the Wine was warm. Wonder how it was stored? We ordered their unique offering aka signature appetizer: Butter Chicken Golgappas. The rice balls come with fillings of minced chicken & butter chicken gravy. Worth one time try. The Satay was disappointing. Chicken was hard and hardly had any thai flavours. We did a live demo for waiters to show how hard it was to break the chicken but they didnt do anything about it. Seems like, these complaints are way too regular for them. Next we ordered Fried rice with Szechwan chicken. Rice was good and flavoursome but the chicken dish didnt look appetising at all. It was edible but something wasnt right with the preparation. Wont go to this place for their food for sure. Will recommend only for the concept.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Ayushi Anand,"Rated With many new cafs sprouting in Connaught Place, New Delhi, Dalal Street enters the market as a concept caf. The concept is that of a stock exchange where instead of shares one has to keep a tab on the prices of the cocktails and mocktails. Every table has a screen installed that indicates the price of drinks which increases or decreases depending on its demand. The best part of this stock exchange bar is that when the market crashes, you get to try single malts and some of the finest cocktails at throw away prices! While enjoying our drinks at Dalal Street, here is what we gorged on at this multi cuisine caf. In vegetarian we recommend you to try Jalapeno Poppers (Rs.195), Mushroom Cheese Poppers (Rs. 165) and the Exotic Veggie Pizza (Rs. 395). Both the poppers were crispy and without cheese over powering the flavor of jalapeno and mushroom, the appetizers had set a very high standard for the food that was to follow. The pizza was thin crust and delish! In non-vegetarian we tried Butter Chicken Gol-gappe (Rs.195), yes we filled the crispy gol-gappe with chicken and poured butter chicken gravy inside and treated our stomach to a heavenly treat like never before. Next on the plate was the super soft Chicken Malai Tikka (Rs. 275) which was topped with cheese and mint sauce on the side.Everything on our plate was palatable and it was hard to waste anything! We even tried the Mutton Galouti (Rs. 325) which were served with mini ulta tawa ka parantha and Chicken Pan-Fried Dumplings (Rs. 275). From the main course, we decided to opt for Thai cuisine and sampled vegetarian Khao Suey (Rs. 375) and vegetarian Green Thai Curry (Rs. 375) which without a doubt were flavorsome. We decided to end this treat with Churros (Rs.165) which were served with dark chocolate sauce and double loaded chocolate fudge brownie (RS. 195). You should definitely give churros a miss and dig in to the chocolate fudge brownie.",Rated 4.0,7,35,??

Shreya Aggarwal,"Rated After visiting vapour bar xchange in gurgaon, was really excited to visit a similar concept in the heart of Delhi - CP. Ambience of the place - nothing new about it. It looks like any other cafe in CP just added a red windows to have red light interiors. Another highlight is that bar xchange is more fun as the rates actually vary remarkably. This fluctuation is clearly visible owing to the really low starting point. Here went in the afternoon and the prices were mostly as the menu, so it was actually a 'boring stock market'! We were a huge group, therefore managed to try a lot of dishes on their menu. To begin with starters: we ordered honey chili potato, jalapeo poppers and five spices fish nuggets. They were all average, no striking flavours, fish was well cooked but the flavours were not as expected. Jalapeo poppers were fine, just that they were not the usual taste - good that there was a change :) In the main course, we ordered exotic veg pizza, mezze veg platter, veg arabiatta and nveg creamy sauce pasta. Pasta was not good - recommend to check on your italian chef. We did not receive nveg pasta instead were served veg and we pointed it out that it was not nveg. The staff was, however polite to switch it even if it was consumed. Although, we refused the torture for the 2nd time. Pizza was fine, mezze platter was the highlight - great hummus flavour, fresh veggies and falafel options (great job on this) Drinks were 1stly pricey as compared to bar xhchange. Apple tot - no comments, real bad experience on that ! Oreo shake was good in a huge glass - it could have been better if it was a lil more thick, but great taste still! Service - a lil slow, even when the restaurant was not crowded. We had to ask for water for 5 ppl separately when the staff realised he needs to serve all of us with water. Final word - There is a certain room for improvement in all areas.",Rated 2.5,50,120,??

Himanshu Broota,"Rated A new restaurant with a different concept. Liquor prices fall and rise on the basis of demand but don't think they vary too much while one sits in the restaurant. So, one may not be able to benefit from it. The interiors are decent but the food isn't nice. We ordered mix penne pasta, and it was just 2/5. Exotic veg pizza- 3/5. Jalepeno poppers were the find, really liked the crisp outer layer and the cheesy filling with fresh salsa sauce. So a 4/5 for this dish. Drinks were normal as we ordered stella pints, so not much of a difference. Staff and hospitality didn't appeal to us and there always remains a question mark as to at what price are you buying a drink. So you have to keep bugging the waiter and he seemed as if we were asking for too much from him.",Rated 3.0,21,120,??

The decor gave it a wall Street kind of a look which is self explanatory. Great music and interiors add to the experience. Prices of liquor were not exorbitant but weren't that cheap too. As for food the menu was extensive and had some interesting dishes like 'Butter Chicken Golgappa' and Mushroom deviance... Were really good.

We ordered chicken risotto, fish and chips and Schezwan chilli chicken.. and we liked all! None disappointed us. I had a beer and my friend had an iced tea, which she liked! ;) What I'd really advice is that you gotta train your staff better. The servers need to be more confident about the dishes that are being asked about. And they need to know the etiquette well.

Shraddha Singh,"Rated I went to Cafe dalal street on a Monday evening .The place has a nice set up but not very aesthetically designed interior. The one thing which I really did not like is that the staff was very laid back . I asked them to give me the wi-fi password so that I could monitor the prices from the app on my phone but both the staff gave me a password which did not work and even after asking thrice they seem reluctant even when they were standing idle as bar was mostly empty. Moving forward I ordered jalapeo poppers and spring roll ,spring roll were terrible and the dip served was horrible. One of the popper tasted bitter and was a thumbs down as well. For drink I ordered an Eliminator Pitcher and even after saying less ice it was filled with ice and tasted like a medicine . I was very excited to visit the place but it was a total let down and I wish they improve at every front. Overall : 3/5 because I really wish the place to do better as I love the concept of the place .

Shreya Verma,"Rated The concept of Cafe Dalal Street is very interesting! Drink prices keep fluctuating depending on demand. So it's possible to get a drink for as low as Rs. 100! There are screens all over with the price charts and they are fascinating to follow. Between my friends and I had we had Bira Blonde beer and Kingfisher beer. Again, the price depended on the demand at that time. The food prices are fixed though. The food is quite good. We had the oven-stuffed chicken fingers, Malaysian chicken satay, mushroom cheese poppers, butter pepper prawns, a mushroom fusilli pasta and a pepperoni pizza. The oven-stuffed chicken fingers were quite good. As far as the chicken satay was concerned, the taste of lemon grass was quite overpowering. The prawns and the pepperoni pizza were quite average. The pasta was quite good but the star of the meal was the mushroom cheese poppers dish. They were absolutely delicious! The cheese was nice and gooey and each popper had a mushroom half in it. My only complaint with the poppers is the portion. There were only 6 pieces in a plate. My experience at Cafe Dalal Street was pretty good! I think I will probably head back soon- for the fascinating drinks-ordering style and for the mushroom poppers.",Rated 4.5,26,38,??

Caf Dalal Street has come up with a very interesting and unique concept that gives you the feel of being a part of stock market. The most facinating thing is that the price of eatables keep changing. Its actually fun to watch the screens and notice the hike in prices. The first thing that attracts you here is the super loud music which can be heard even before you actually enter the place. The second thing that brings a sparkle to your eyes is the ambience, the bright red color. I cannot say much about the food because we boozed more than we ate.

The golgappa was served with minced chicken and onion mixture along with tomato gravy. Something not to be tried. Dahi ke kebab- 2/5 This is something which you should completely avoid while dining here. The hung curd mixture inside the kebab was sticky and had a soft fevicol like texture to it.

Rahul Taluja,"Rated The new kid in the block and named after the famous street in Mumbai which houses the Mumbai Stock Exchange, there can't be a better indication of what it has - a bar stock exchange. Benefits - keeps the guys busy and cheap alcohol - a beer as low as 50 bucks, absolut at 94 and red label at 100 odd bucks. The ambiance is detailed - has different themes on all walls. The in house DJ rocks and this is to my belief the only place in CP which has a big dancing space. The food - had loads and not disappointed from anything. Started with Butter Chicken Gol Gappas, simple yet a great find. The texture was such that it could hold the stuffing without getting broken - for that they addes sabutdana. Then had Chilli Garlic Noodles, Wasabi Prawns and Grilled Fish and everything perfect. Bingo. Then, we moved onto a Pepperoni Pizza which was one of the best ever. Finally, it was the Mutton Platter - Mutton Moga curry, their speciality with Dal Makhani and Lachha Parathas. Both tasted amazing, only minor improvement can be done on Mutton, should be more soft. Special mention to the manager Vikas who was extremely nice and took good care - advised their find and speciality cocktail - the bankruptcy - priced at a 1000 bucks and expensive - but then I haven't seen something like that before.

They display the prices of the liquors,which fall and rise according to the demand and supply. How cool is that! They also have an app- so you can stay updated with the prices and sneakily order your favourite drinks for cheap. The menu consists of cocktails and snacks; with names of dishes and drinks correlating to different Investment/stock exchange terms. I tried the Dutch Investment- A very intense cocktail,with prominent taste of the cardamom. It was heavy on the tongue density Wise,and really really warming. I also took a sip of Cosmopolitan and Jager Bomb from my friends- that's what I'll order the next time I go. Loved it. One of the owners,Himanshu,recommended the Rose Tequila shots to us. They were sweet and thick,nothing like I've ever tried in Delhi,But absoloutely sinful. It was like the amalgamation of all things good. In food- I LOVED the jalapeno poppers. Crispy on the outside and the molten melting cheese on the inside - I could eat them all day. The veg Dumplings were good- though I would've preferred a more spicy sauce. Also,I witnessed the 'Butter chicken golgappa' while I was there. There's some chicken,some gravy,make your own golgappa and pop it into your mouth. The non vegeteriaans were drooling over them! I couldn't try much as I was running late,but the drinks and food I tried were awesome. The music is excellent- you can't help but dance on your seat. This is definitely the next party place of CP.

Shagun Raizada (Myfoodproject.org),"Rated I don't rate restaurants 5/5 so easily but this place deserves every bit of it!! I am in awe of this place for everything about this place was amazing starting from the concept, ambiance, drinks and food. CONCEPT: Dalal street is based on the concept of fluctuating prices for drinks based on the availability and demand. You can see the changing prices on large screens all around the restaurant. This is something very exciting and different. It was fun to order. Courtesy this concept, some drinks can be availed at really reasonable prices as well. Loved it!! AMBIANCE: A huge floor in M block which is divided into various sections. Where I sat had some really large tables with red tint in the lighting and a screen attached to every table. Another area was a little more well lit and formal. Dalal Street also has a semi open terrace area. One really cool thing about Dalal street is the fact that they have dedicated dance floor next to the DJ and bar area. This floor is big in size. It's a rarity to find a dance floor in Delhi now hence I found this perfect for parties! FOOD: Butter chicken Golgappe were the highlight of my outing! So unique and so good! Fill your golgappa with chicken chunks and pour butter chicken curry. Vegetarians get kadai paneer golgappe. This dish is a must try! Assorted sushi platter had three types of really fresh sushi. Shrimp Tacos were really light. Crisp outside and filled with an assortment of shrimps, cabbage and some veggies. Teriyaki Lamb Burger was juicy and huge in size. Was served with Fries and sauces. Jalapeno Poppers were very different from the usual. Capsicum fried delicately with a lot of cheese and jalapenos filled inside it. A burst of cheese with every bite. Galouti Kebab was extemely soft and melted in the mouth! Tequila Rose was a LOVELY drink! It was served as a shot. Milk based shot with a flavour of rose in it. Highly recommended!! I hadnt tasted anything like this before. Eliminitor is again a drink that you wouldnt have had before. It is a mix of all spirits like rum, vodka, gin, enery juice and juices. One glass and you are done! Try this when in the mood for drinking Red and White Sangrias were very good! Blueberry cheesecake was soft and had the right amount of sugar. Not too sweet nor too bland. Overall, I loved everything about this place and suggest you all to try it for a different experience :) myfoodproject.org",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Yamini Bhargava,"Rated The place is at the outer circle of connaught pace, the theme is very innovative, stock exchange! The prices of drinks keep on fluctuating, depending on something the management only knows. The place has a lot of screens with prices displaying and interiors are fine, toilets are nicely done. But the major issue with the place is the drinks are super bad. We ordered martini which came in a regular martini glass but filled less than half, which is not what i expected or I get at other places. Margarita was bland, too much salt on the glass. The third drink was the worst. Sour temptation was a frothy drink with cherries in it and frankly speaking so bad that it can single handedly can spoil your evening. The khata meetha drink is like a bad syrup of mango. Its annoyingly bad. Go visit the place if you want to waste your money and spoil your day. good luck.The dynamic pricing concept is fun and interesting but actually if you observe closely the fluctuation in price is just 10-20 bucks.. The waiters ate kind of ignorant and don't serve you untill you ask them to.. Which is little unprofessional. DJ is trying too hard to play something different but at the end his mixes were not that good.",Rated 1.5,20,76,??
Nikita Tandon,"Rated A new concept.... Different deals...as if we are at the stock exchange market.... Where prices of your drinkes rise n fall like the stock market!! Loved the concept as well as the the food. The most unique dish we had was the butter chicken golgappa- where the fillings were of minced chicken topped with butter gravy..unique ultimate too yumm...along with saffron chicken skewers- a very tender yummy juicy chicken with a very yummy humus... Appreciable!! To match it with drinks we went for the wolf punch n the zing spritzer. Spritzer was a strong one with combination of wine n gin with pepper n strawberry whereas wolf punch was vodka cucumber cloves,orange. And at last we went for the chicken lasagne... A yummy one.

Virus,"Rated The Bombay Stock Exchange - The biggest Indian Stock Exchange Market located on the Dalal Street in Mumbai is the idea behind this whole place. From the name itself one can have a decent idea of what the place will be all about. Located in the M Block, outer circle of one of the most happening places in Delhi aka CP (Connaught Place), the place offers beverages not on fixed prices but as per the price fluctuation depending upon the trending/demanding drink on that particular time/day. Like the stock exchange market you have to keep an eagle eye on the screens placed just above the tables to book your share of drinks on the lowest price. They also have a app through which you can order the drinks using your mobile phone as well - A smart concept to serve booze. The whole idea to serve booze in this format is quite new and is trending these days among the delhities.Cafe Dalal street has a huge spacious place with quite a happening ambience, with most of the interiors done in blue color having beautiful pictures, posters of people talking over the phones like what imagines things being done in the stock exchange markets, bull and bear shaking hands, and quirky quotes written on the walls all over the place. Hats off to the interior designer of this place who has done everything in capacity to make it look like a stunning replica of the dalal street. Along with the rocking ambience, they also have a proper dance floor and an amazing DJ mixing up all the Bollywood and Hollywood tracks quite well. Though the dim lighting and loud music can be an issue for some. I went to this place along with couple of friends of mine and started the things off with Sheeshas and drinks. The sheeshas were of top quality and the drinks too. Chocolate Martini (made up of Rum, Chocolate and Vanilla), Tequila Rose (a tequila shot with strawberry flavor), Mojito's, Apple Tot (A trio of Apple, Cinnamon and Basil) and Peru (mixture of Guava, mint, cumin and Celery) were some of the drinks that we had and among those the Apple Tot and Tequila Rose were the two i liked the most. Followed these up with their amazing Butter chicken golgappas (chunks of chicken, onion and mint) and non veg platter. The Golgappas not just tasted yumm but their presentation was also quite appreciable. Quite an innovative idea to serve golgappas with chicken and chutney and is a must must try here for the non-vegetarians. Non-veg Platter was also good. Next we tried their Milano Eggplant Crostini which was a European Appetizer having eggplant, tomatoes and basil on a thin crust. Also tried their Non Veg and Chicken Tikka Pizzas, which were not too heavy on the stomach and tasted absolutely amazing with hot cheese topping and equally chopped chicken pieces on a thin base. In the burgers section, their Mongolian Fried Chicken (Crispy Slow fried chicken, topped with kimchi salad and honey chilli jam) and Chicken Steak burger (chicken patty topped with cheese slice) are big in size and on taste as well and can be considered as highlight of the day.Chilli Chicken and Chicken Lasagna were also delicious and falls under the must try category. After having all these amazing appetizers, burgers, pizzas and drinks, It was time to move on to the main course and we found no option better than the Grilled Fish (grilled with lemon mustard sauce), Nasi Goreng (aromatic plum sugar and bird chilli tossed rice served with chicken satay), Thai curry and Rice. The food not only tasted good but had smashing presentation as well. What more can one ask for than Amazingly presented dishes which taste delicious too. The desserts were Churros, Blue berry cheese cake and tiramisu, well presented and well baked are the two most apt words to describe these amazing desserts. The staff is courteous and knowledgeable (you can ask questions or take suggestions for the food/drinks freely), and are ready to do anything to make you feel comfortable/relaxed with the owner himself indulging in all these activities to make sure that you do have a pleasant time at his place. They have seating arrangements from two to ten people at a table, depending upon your requirement you can choose the size of table and settle down and enjoy yourself. Since the place is trending these days, it would be wise to make an advance reservation. Overall an amazing experience and will surely comeback for more. Recommended !!",Rated 4.0,62,2218,??
Pulkit Gupta,"Rated Situated on the outer circle, a cafe with good food to taste! What I have usually seen with cafe 's is that since they have bars.. Their food quality or taste is usually not great as they don't take special care for it.. But, I felt cafe dalal Street was different! The food was fresh and good in taste. A very good varied variety of different cuisines with the dalal Street concept.

EMPTY STOMACH,"Rated Dalal Street is the the only cafe whose name attracted me more than its food . A different concept of price fluctuations is present at this place which is both confusing and ambiguous. STARTING WITH WORST - firstly i would like to review its service. The servers were ignorant .They were unaware about menu (we really had a tough time in deciding our drinks and food )and didnt even bother to explain us the concept . It was the worst service i have ever experienced. Ambience is the only reason why you can think about trying this place. It was empty when we went but they have given a retro cafe look with wooden seats in half area while the other half is like any ordinary longue in CP. We ordered clasaic martini, Cosmo , vodkatini , honey chilly potatoes and veggie pizza. Drinks were good. Food was very average. Quantity is very less. Ambience 3/5 Food 2/5 Value for money 1.5/5 Service 1/5 You can give it a try if you love hanging out with friends with a couple of beers and chilled out ambience but else , brokers (servers) might result you in losses.

Sadish Garg,"Rated The concept of stock exchange in restaurant industry is not new but its the first time this concept has been introduced in Delhi. The prices of drinks change with the every order depending on the demand of the drink and you can track the prices on the screens at every table to make sure you get the best value. I visited this place as an invite with few other friends and tried a lot of their offerings: Butter Chicken golgappe:- Yes, the concept sounds bizarre but definitely worth a shot. Crispily fried gol gappe served with chicken filling and gravy on the side. Non-veg Mezze Platter- Everything on the platter was upto the mark whether it be the hummus, grilled chicken or soft pita breads. Chicken Tandoori Platter- I didn't quite like the Seekh Kebabs but the chicken malai tikka was melt in the mouth. Chilli Potatoes- A little too dry for me but the spice quotient was good making them go perfectly well with the drinks. Burgers- We also tried their Chicken Steak Burger and Mangolian Fried Chicken Burger. These burgers were the best part of our meal as they were juicy, the bun was soft and made for a hearty meal in themselves. Nasi Goreng- This was something I was trying for the first time but I quite liked the combination of spicy rice topped with a sunny side up. The chicken satay served alongwith was good too. Drinks- We also tried a couple of drinks namely Zombie Street, Tumse Na Ho Paega (I seriously Lol'ed), the sour transaction and a few more. For me Zombie street stood out the most as I am a rum lover. Service is an area which they need to work upon otherwise the place in totality is good.

Arjun Chaudhry,"Rated A lot of new restaurants are once again opening up in the heart of the city that is connaught Place. Located in the morning block on the outer circle, it isn't hard to find. What attracted me was the concept of stock exchange where prices of drinks change according to the demand. Though the concept is not unique but thought it would definitely worth a try. The interiors are good. The good thing about this place is how spacious it is which is hard to find today. Now coming to the food, we ordered the butter chicken golgappe and tawa paneer golgappe. The minced chicken was tender and the gravy which is used as the same way of water in the golgappe. The paneer one was also okay. Next we ordered a alfedo pasta. It was decent enough. We also ordered fish and chips. The fish was quite tasty and the tartar dip was the usual not anything extraordinary. I ordered hara bhara kebab. It was way too soft but it was delicious. The long Island ice tea we had was good but LIIT at hauz khas social is definitely better. Now coming to the service, the service was good and staff was prompt in action. Overall, in my opinion it is a one time try unless they improve on their food which is the most vital component. There are screens all over the place to show changing prices instead on which a simple tablet on each table would be a better idea. Though the concept is good but the place would not do well unless the food is better than what is right now.",Rated 3.0,56,264,??
Nitika Bhatia,"Rated Visited this place last week as a part of a Bloggers' table and I must say I was totally impressed. From the interiors to the food and drinks, everything was perfect and it seems CP has now become a cooler place to hang out with friends .. Replacing HKV. Coming to what I ordered, in food we ordered Chicken fingers, penne arrabiatta, veg Indian platter and honey chilli potato. I seldom eat non veg dishes, but these Chicken fingers were the best that I have had in the recent times. The veg dishes were equally good, my favorite being the Pasta which was just the way I like it - creamy and not very spicy. I was glad to see that they have a perfect menu which includes various cuisines and if you are going out with friends who have different tastes. The drinks were really interesting and I tried Wolf Punch, Deal Closer and Tequila rose shot. Among the drinks, my favorite was the Tequila rose shot which is first of its kind shots that I tried and loved it. In desserts we tried Phirni and Tiramisu which were decent but I wish they had more desserts in the menu. Service was slow but then it was a party night so I will give them benefit of doubt. Overall, I think its a must try place with your friends over a weekend and you'll definitely love the ambience and its innovative concept.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Shahrukh Habib,"Rated A Restro-Bar themed on a Stock Exchange. The thought itself builds the curiosity about what this place would be. As you tend to enter, the traffic noise of CP outer circle swiftly changes into a deafening music.The one thing that I didn't expect here was a proper dance floor for people to enjoy. The food variety is good. The service takes a bit longer depending on the rush. Enough already has been said about the LIVE Streaming of the Liquor prices. It indeed adds to the excitement of the visitors. The ambience is lively and happening. A special mention to the DJ, who knew very well how to mix the Bollywood numbers from the 70s, 80s, 90s and to present. I could say that the DJ knew it very well how to keep the spirits up in the house.The interiors are dimly lit and the seating arrangement has a variety for all size of groups. They also have an outer area for seating too (not recommended) but it is not as it is inside.Advance reservation would be advised as availability of tables might be a concern if you arrive in small group (like 3 or 4).RATINGS: Ambiance : 5/5Food Variety : 3.5/5Food Quality : 3.5/5Service : 3/5Taste : 3.5/5Value For Money : 3.5/5VERDICT: Highly recommended for all the Party-aholics in the town.",Rated 4.0,18,240,??

Shivendra Goel,"Rated Enjoyed a nice get together at the Cafe Dalal Street last night after reading about it in the Trending List and the concept of bar stock exchange intrigued us all. We reached pretty early around 7 and the place was taking shape slowly and steadily and was almost full by the time we left around 10o clock. Firsty the Ambience Massive Place Huge spaces all around with lcd's in every corner displaying the rising and falling prices of drinks but what disappointed me was the lighting and the quality of interiors. It was too dark and shady for my taste and the interiors were not of the highest quality. The Beverages were the main attraction at Cafe dalal street. The system it works on is similar to a stock exchange in which the prices of drinks and beverages keep rising and falling as per the popularity of the drink at that very moment. The concept was very interesting and the cafe also has an mobile application platform so you can view the prices and order the drinks straight from your cellphone. The variation in prices wasn't a lot. Hardly 10-15rs. Rise and fall so not much attention was paid to the stock charts after the first round of drinks :P Coming to the food The Butter chicken golgappa's and The Harre bhare kebab's are a MUST TRY. This place is a nice concept, first of it's kind in Delhi(Gurgaon Has Vapour Bar Exchange Which Works On A Similar Pattern) Should be a one time try at least on everyone's checklist, this place wouldn't disappoint you.

Chainita Rawat,"Rated Cafe dalal street, featured in Newly opened places is a bar/cafe based on Famous Bar stock exchange theme. This was one thing that particularly attracted me to this place. Imagine ,all you gotta do is keep an eye on the bar exchange rate and once the price dips, voila you can order your drink for less. I visited this place with my friend ,and so at once we liked the theme and decor of this cafe. Also ,they play some really good music ,so ya their music along with amazing decor makes this place a good choice. Closer look into their decor shows that they've really spent some good money in making this place stand unique. Talking about food , we ordered their butter fried prawns, One cheese pizza, achari paneer tikka along with Lemon drop martini and Cosmo. Their food was delicious, specially prawns. Their prawns were fresh ,crispy and nicely done to perfection. Their pizza was also nice with nice thin crust . But what we loved the most was Lemondrop martini and Cosmo. We even tried their tiramisu which was also good. Best part about their menu was that it is amazingly full of options, and that's something that a person like me totally falls for. So next time you're around CP and tired of ordinary places ,then Cafe Dalal Street is the place.

Sidhant Ahuja,Rated A bar/cafe based on the concept of stock exchange. The place has screens all over showcasing the increase and decrease of food prices and beverages. Located at the M block market of Connnaught Place this place will certainly be a hit among delhites. The place is warmly lit and has 3-D interiors protruding out of the wall showing the hustling life of Stock Brokers. One particular wall has telephones all over showing how much time is spent talking on the phone in this field. Like the decor they have quite a few innovations on the menu as well. ButterChicken Gol Gappas and Mangolian Fried Chicken burger are a must try. Thai Mojito had kaffir lime which gave it an amazing twist and had a strong aroma to it. Cosmo was a let down for me. Jalapeo Poppers for vegans were served in shot glasses with red chili were absolutely delicious in taste and very addictive too. Had two of them in the entire evening. They have Fish N Chips for main course which was quite weird but once ordered I understood why. Huge deep fried fish pieces served with rum cocktail sauce was certainly upto the mark. Had tiramisu for desserts although the coffee content in it was way too high than chocolate definitely satisfied my palate. Can't really say for other people.

Karan Marwah,"Rated Caf Dalal Street is yet another buzzing destination for delicious food, themed interiors, drinks and thumping music in Connaught Place. With it's stock market themed decor, it amazed me. With screens showcasing the price of drinks in a Wall Street style, it is super fun to see which drink is trending and hence, helping you decide what to order. Food is as innovative as the interiors of Cafe Dalal Street. Butter Chicken Gol Gappa is the MOST SATISFYING DISH EVER and I strongly recommend it. Another gem on the menu is a dish called 'Jalapeno Poppers', consisting of deep fried stuffed jalapeno chillies served with an amazingly tangy dipping sauce. If you love cheese and Italian food, then you must try the Chicken Lasagna. Mangolian Fried Chicken Burger is a dish which HUGE when it comes to size and as well as flavors. They've got some classic thin crust pizzas for those wishing to go for them (definitely not the best item on the menu). For main course, Thai Green Curry is what I tried, it was definitely well cooked and yummy, however, the gravy could've been thicker. Will be putting out more details on my blog, very soon.

Prashant Singh,"Rated As the name says, this place is based on stock exchange theme. The alcohol here is priced on demand and supply of the particular brand. The more you order the higher the price. This is actually to encourage people to have other brands also, apart from the popular brands. We were here for a meet with a big group. We made ourselves comfortable and ordered for a couple of mocktails with Butter Chicken gol gappe(yes, Butter Chicken Gol Gappe), non veg Kebab Platter, Chilly Chicken, Non Veg Mezze Platter, chicken satay, Veg Bruschetta and Chilly Potato. Butter Chicken bol gappe were just OK. The positive part was that the gravy served with the Gol Gappa was good, confirmation of a good butter chicken. My suggestion for this dish is that they should serve chicken Tikka as a stuffing for the bol gappas. It will enhance the taste. Just a suggestion. Veg bruschetta is something that we should not even think of while ordering. Chilly honey potato was just ok. Buy The kebab platter and non veg mezze platter were superb. Chilly chicken and chicken stay were also too good. For the mains we had Grilled Fish, Chicken Steak Burger, Mangolian fried chicken Burger, and Nasi Goreng. The Burger were very well done. Full of flavours and adequately saucy. The Buns were also of good quality. Grilled fish was grilled to perfection and the mustard sauce covering the fish also complimenting it completely. Nasi Goreng was also prepared well. Presentation was great too. Desserts were to die for. We had Brownie, Tiramisu, Gulab jamun, Churros and Blueberry cheese cake. Brownie was very goey and superb. Tiramisu was having perfect flavour of coffee and was adequately cheezy. Relished every bite of the desserts.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Rahul Batra,"Rated Having been to Bombay Stock Exchange, I knew what i had to expect out of this dalal street. But they have stood out when it came to the implementing of the same concept. fairly a big place with an awesome looking bar along with the blue theme all over they registered themselves in my good books. With the dynamic pricing you really need to keep a tap on what all to order and when just to keep the amount within limits. they have almost all major brands of drinks and definitely best of the cocktail experiments can be found over here. Sour transaction became my favorite with an optimum quantity of bourbon with cinnamon had given a sour flavor. Tandoori non- Veg platter is something which is worth mentioning as well, mixed with chicken and mutton options it has something for everyone. Chicken Steak burger - The juicy burger served with fries and beetroot will satisfy your hunger for sure. do make sure you hold the burger tight. Bruschetta - You can avoid this veg dish completely. Butter chicken gol gappa - Something which not everyone could think of i guess, minced chicken in place of potatoes and gravy on the top. Don't forget to fill whole lot of gravy to have the maximum flavor and taste. Best dish for me. period. Overall good experience and for sure you will have a gala time with your buddies. Looking forward to the next visit and trying their other menu. Cheers... bragstreet.in",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Dhruv Mittal,"Rated Cafe Dalal Street, the new kid on the connaught place street, taking the entire F&B sector by storm. This Cafe's USP is that the prices of alcohol is based on the demand/supply principle of financial markets, an ingenious concept. The interiors are so beautifully constructed, it's almost surreal, you would almost feel like a stock broker, continuously keeping a check on price radar and hitting the buy button as soon as the drink hits lowest. Getting a Budweiser for 80 INR, are you kidding me? Coming down to the food, a place so focussed on alcohol generally doesn't much focus on food, as i told you earlier, not your typical place. The place has amazing food. I tried their: Four Cheese Pizza: amazing crust and absolutely delightful. Chicken Gol Gappe: As suggested by a friend, but not too great according to me. White Sauce Pasta: They have really decent pasta, to keep you going while your drink. Dal Makhani Naan: Dal Makhani had a good taste in comparison to the most Mughlai centric restaurants. The owners Vidit and Himanshu could be considered the best hosts, specially catering to every customer needs.The staff is really nice especially viney, sanjay and more( names slipping out due to excessive drinking).

Sukhmani Sakhi,"Rated What years of trying to read the newspaper didnt teach me, Caf Dalaal Street taught me in a minute. Quite a concept there! Similar to the Bombay Stock Exchange, this restaurant has its alcohol prices rising and falling like stocks according to the increase and decrease in the demand. FYI the food is just as exciting and ambitious as the liquor which makes me very happy! Ambience: The interiors are rustic yet quirky with quite a few screens displaying the rising and falling rates of the liquor. There are several sections and a dancing area to suit the guests. Sitting is again varied from section to section and the restaurant is sprawled across a huge area on a single floor. Lighting is dim and I remember loving the starry blue lights over the expansive well equipped bar. Service: The servers are efficient and on their toes. They have good knowledge of the food and drinks menu and are a great help if you want to be taken through the menu. Service was quick most times but in between the peak hours, there was some confusion. However, no complaints there. The food arrived on time and looking pretty appetizing. Drinks: Well they have some interesting concoctions at the bar, which are worth a try. - Sour Transaction was a bourbon-based cocktail with cinnamon, orange and cherries. This was among my favorites, very mild in flavors yet enough to knock you off. - White Wine Zing Spritzer was made with peppers and jalapeos, interesting on the palate but definitely a cocktail for those with an acquired taste. - Chocolate Martini made with rum chocolate and vanilla was quite a dessert, well one with lot liquor! Delicious. - Khatti Meethi was made with vodka, aam panna and coconut. This one was tangy, spicy and sour. Again a very different taste but I quite enjoyed the spunk of the drink. Food: The food menu is diverse and offers a variety to the diners to choose from. The dishes are cleverly created and display innovation and creativity. - Jalapeo Poppers were gooey cheesy bites fried to crispy perfection - Veg spring rolls were flavorful and chunky. I loved the accompanying sweet and spicy sauce with it that was made even chunkier with finely chopped cabbage and onions. - Dahi ke kebab managed to meet my expectations. The kebabs were silky smooth in texture with the right amount of spices. - Mutton galouti kebab came with varq parantha. These were sinfully smooth in texture and so well balanced in terms of spices and ingredients. - Non Veg Sushi Platter was quite average. - Slow Fried Chicken was flattened chicken breast coated and fried to a crunchy bite. - Butter chicken pani puri was a lovely concoction with tangy tandoori chicken bits and a beautiful butter gravy served in a DIY platter. Quite interesting. - Pepper prawns were wok tossed and fried in a pepper chilly mix. Subtle flavors and plump prawns to devour. - Corn and cheese quesadillas were rich and heavily loaded with corn filling and dollops of sour cream and tomato salsa. - Keema pie was a pure marvel. The keema was cooked in essential Indian spices simmered in flavorful tomato gravy. Served on a rack of potatoes and crispy puff bread, loaded with a layer of cheese, this was a straight winner for me. - BBQ chicken wings were juicy and finger licking good. The chicken was cooked to a tender perfection. Loved it. - Gulab Jamun was a surprise! Tasted authentic like the ones you get in Indian sweet specialty shops. Sinful, dense and just rightly sweetened. - Churros with chocolate sauce were cooked well but didnt taste quite right - Chocolate brownie was gooey and gracious good! Verdict: A great addition to the chain of pubs and nightbars in Central Delhi. The concept of the restaurant is full of quirk and fun that needs to be experienced at least once. I loved the cosy vibe and music, which complimented the ambience. This could be the new it place in CP that promises a great evening out in terms of food, alcohol, prices and music. Kudos!

Shraddha Sharma,"Rated When one thinks of a special evening celebration or an after office hour drinks, one thinks of having a good time. Don't come here for that. These guys offer you the BEST time only! I had been loathing at the party scene in Delhi being less of a foodies' delight and more of a discotheque experience and the guys at CDS heard me and came up with this brilliant concept of Stock market pricing and one of the most creatively curated menus in town! I was lucky to be invited over for a dinner by the owner and went with scepticism as it says ""cafe"". To my utter surprise, it was nothing like what boring coffee place I had in mind. Ambience: Spacious blue lit interiors with segregated seating for all kinds. The finedine-esque tables, The F.r.i.e.n.d.s. style booths and the stock broker's tables which turned out to be my favorite!! With screen displaying which drink's rates are rising and falling like I'm The Wolf of DalalStreet! The dancefloor is capacious and there is a separate smoking area. The washrooms are well lit and clean till the last minute. Food : There is a reason why I have been gorging about this place and raving it to anyone looking for a place to go. It's no secret that I am in love with their food. Especially a few items that stole my heart. +++ #ButterChickenGolgappe : These are a must try for all Butter Chicken and golgappa lovers. How to eat : Put in a tad bit stuffing of chicken and don't be greedy with the gravy. Less is more in these! A delight!!!! +++ #SlowFriedChicken was cooked to perfection, went well with drinks and I loved the dip +++ #Sushi #platter was obviously one of my favorites here but it was genuinely good. I'd say a go-to party spot for you sushi lovers is here! +++ #DalalStreetKeemaPie . I have never been a true keema fan until this moment. What a brilliant idea of giving it a crunch by adding matthi to it! I don't know who thought of it but kudos! +++ #GulabJamunwithRabri was my favourite of all desserts and beautiful amalgamation of flavors. ++ #MuttonGalauti was a hit with us. Melt in mouth. Very close to the Authentic flavors. ++ #ButterPepperPrawns were cooked perfectly and all of my group loved it but were too bland for my liking. + #Dahikekebab were Soft and flavorful. We're beautifully presented and cooked very well. + #JalapeoPoppers were oh so good! I love how cheesy they were. If you are a beer person or drinking a bubbly cocktail. Try these! + #CornQuesadillas were good. The crust could be a little more cooked though + #BarbequeChickenWings were little and vanished out of sight as soon as they came. The sauce was less Barbeque flavoured than I like however. + #Springrolls were fine and crunchy. I assume they'd go well for those of us who like food simple. ++ #PennePasta was bang on perfect. ++ The best thing about the #Tiramisu was that the cake was really soft and soaked well. I liked it pretty close to my first favourite. + #Doubleloadedcheesecake was good though I'd like it to be cheesier! The only one food item I found off the flavor was Churros which was okay and cooked well but in stale oil. That killed the dish for me. But am sure with the constant goodies we got that this was a one off incident. I would still try them next time! Service: My favourite part of the review is how hospitable the staff was. And this full star goes out to Shekhar, Pankaj and Sanju who served us with all their attention and courtesy. I did notice that almost all the servers were keeping a close eye on their tables and were within approach for the guests. Cafe Dalal Street is my next haunt and is a recommendation for all you foodies and pub lovers too!

Kritika Kalra,"Rated It was eagerly awaited in delhi after i visited bar stock exchange at bombay. Everything was pretty good. Butter chicken golgappe, chicken wings, chicken biriyani platter were really delicious. But my major disappointment was alcohol. It exists in the menu but not at the bar. Another is the tax. Overall it lacks alot of things to make it an awesome chilling place. Ambience : average Music : average Food: good Service: excellent Hookah: commissioner",Rated 3.5,16,65,??

Suchintan Kar,"Rated Food was decent. We tried butter chicken gol gappe, chicken tikka pizza and Szechuan chilli chicken. The chicken gol gappe had only 5 pieces - a thing you might want to bear in mind if you have a larger group. It had peculiar taste - a novel idea of having a gol gappa stuffed in bits of masala chicken instead of the usual stuffing n butter gravy as a substitute to the ""paani"". The alcohol rates were a bit haywire though. The Android app from which you are supposed to order showed different prices than that being displayed on the ticker above the bar. Surprisingly there were no table numbers for tables near the bar counter - we were asked to put a random no. as table no. for the order through the app.; post which the guys were supposed to get a pop-up at their end and should have placed our order once they physically confirmed the same from us! - a thing that never worked. So had to resort to the good old way of manual ordering.",Rated 3.5,9,3,??
Sayantani Chakrabarti,"Rated Generally, concept restaurants mar themselves with the whole interest shifted towards the theme and ambiance, while compromising on the food. But Cafe Dalal Street is no such place. With an energetic atmosphere, and a very palpable make-do situation, the restaurant serves you the best of food! Delicious and mouthwatering, most of the dishes make you crave for more. Chicken so soft and juicy it melts in your mouth as well as your heart. Rates of drinks go up and down as per demand. You can see it yourself on the running sensex charts. Drinks are wildly innovative and presented in the weirdest styles. A huge bar, a dance floor, in-house DJ, and several separate spaces, Cafe Dalal Street gives you a feeling of 'ghar nahi jaunga main'. If you really think I'm making it up, go visit the place. Taste the greatness of their food and be mesmerised. Cafe Dalal Street: SOLD!!",Rated 5.0,5,18,??

Mayukh Datta,"Rated Short visit to this place. Already knew about the concept as I have been to Vapour Exchange in Gurgaon couple of times and love the food drinks menu and esp the music there. So wanted to check the same concept in CP. Short visit of two people where we ordered over the screen and downloaded the app later. the app is a replica of the Vapor exchange app. the drinks pricing is very good and economical esp if you go with a large group. This pricing concept works best when you order bulk and have fun seeing how your bulk buying changes the pricing on the screen. The starters ordered were paneer tikka golgappe and dahi kabab. the paneer tikka golgappe (poppers) were very good with crisp golgappe which you fill with a paneer and bell pepper masala combo and fill it with a butter chicken sort of butter gravy and pop it in the mouth. The gravy and paneer are very tasty playing against the crunch of the golgappa. the dahi ke kabab were the proper hung kabab sort slight sour and with a sweet tinge of dahi. Thankfully it wasn't the bread with paneer filled fried variety of the dahi kabab which are a big thumbs down. If all the above is good why not a 4 or above rating. it's because of the music and the feel of the place. The music is obnoxiously loud which makes conversation nearly impossible across a small square table. Even the music isn't so good while Vapor exchange had some awesome music and volume levels are just right which allow conversations and lighting which aren't dim. Here the empty space in between means they will encourage DJ party nights meaning a pub and relaxing space for after work isn't the desired positioning. If only they addressed that part, it would be my favorite after work sort of place in CP.",Rated 3.5,40,70,??

Aanchal Mathur,"Rated Between an array of new cafes opening up rapidly around the city, this one is sure shot a distinct one with the concept of a Stock Exchange Bar ! The cafe surely looks amazing with every nook and corner giving a vintage and exquisite feel. The ambiance is superb with a lot of comfort. The menu has a lot to chose from, and dishes are sufficient for two people. I tried the BBQ Chicken wings and having tried the same at several other places I can safely recommend it to be one of the best ! The bar as well has a lot to offer with the ticker right above it constantly showing the high and low's of the price, which is interesting ! Even if one has no knowledge of stock exchange, you will have an idea once it's about the drinks ! The app concept on the playstore about the drinks can be changed or modified a little as it can be a little cumbersome for the customers.
