Amita Chhabra,"Rated Finally I got a restaurant which can take me to the heritage, which can brush my memories when I visited chokhi dhani in Jaipur.... The food, hospitality and folk Rajasthani song was so relishing.... They welcome you with shikanji and some papards which is complimentary. We ordered mutton shorba and it was very tasty... We ordered bharma tangri and that was simply out of this world... As we were running short of time so didn't had much but surely be visiting it again very soon for main course....",Rated 5.0,22,52,??

Nidhi Agrawal,"Rated A big NO for visiting with friends. This is totally a family restaurant which serves amazing variety of North Indian Cuisine. The only problem with the restaurant is the dinning tables and the location of the restaurant. They share the floor with Junkyard Cafe & Barbecue Nation which is something be a treat for this restaurant for the 1st time but once they have the food of devi vibes, they won't get a better option in connaught Place. And the tables are very conjusted. They really need to change their furnitures. But overall the experience was very good. Must visit place with family!",Rated 4.0,23,73,??
Dee Paul,"Rated Desi Vibes has opened up a branch at cp after running one in noida. The interiors are really nice and interesting , giving the restaurant a nice desi feel and character. Its located on the first floor at the outer circle in cp. The service is a bit slow but the good interiors make up for somewhat slow service and little expensive prices. The food presentation is good and the food itself is reasonably good though not extraordinary. A place worth visiting for clicking some nice pics with good interiors while enjoying desi indian food.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Rohit Jain,Rated It's a nice place. They have a very good service and a great quality of food. Ambience is also good. But they charge a high rate of service charge i.e. @10%,Rated 4.5,2,31,??

Ankursandu0,"Rated esi Vibes is one of the better places at Cannaught Place to enjoy some Mughlai and authentic Desi cuisine. For the food, we were served with a welcome jaljeera drink which was nice...dahi kebabs were excellent, paneer tikka was OK, chicken tikka was good! They serve 8 varieties of pickles which are excellent. The breads and main course again was very satisfactory, followed by pan candies as mouth fresheners!

Suraksha Mattoo,"Rated Hidden jewel in CP. Dhaba style ambience takes you to Punjab. They welcome you with welcome drink and papad. Their welcome drink was so tasty that we asked for more. Food is very tasty,mouth watering and service is quick. They served all rotis at once which we sent back and asked to get one round at a time. Dal makhani, rara chicken and chicken malai tikka are finger licking good. Good restaurant for family outing. You get some nice clicks with decorations indoors and outdoors. I would suggest fellow zomatizens to go and stand for reservations rather than relying on bookings made on phone especially on weekends.",Rated 4.0,133,380,??
Shagun Garg,"Rated For the first time I saw such a place that has done so much hard work to come out with the authentic Indian ambience and the equally spicy desi food. The bar, for that matter, was named theka! The butter chicken and the shahi paneer are some of the dishes you would just love out here with the equally amazing and tasty breads. The servicemen too dressed up in the desi way were just too good in the hospitality. I just loved the place altogether.",Rated 4.5,20,80,??

Sugandh Juneja,"Rated Went there for the first time today & I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. Absolutely adore the rustic ambience, decor & music. The food was very good but what deserves a special mention are the pickles. The garlic and ginger pickles are a must! The staff - very cordial & nice. The only 2 things I expect improvement on - the food temperature needs to be right (was a bit lukewarm) & the cramped seating might make this a less private eating joint than others. All in all I would go there again :)",Rated 4.5,20,62,??

Ordered the chicken platter, kadhai chicken and butter naan. Also ordered the mai tai. The chicken platter had a mix of chicken tikka, chicken seekh, malai tikka and a few other things. This was the star of the night. Really yummy. The main course was average. Like good average. Nothing special, but tasted good. Ofcourse, the achaar dabba they have was really good. Loved the garlic and lemon pickle. :D Didn't like the mai tai much though. Have had way better mai tai at other places. It's a good place to go for Indian fare. Try and decide for yourselves :)",Rated 3.5,51,480,??
Ayoosh A Jain,Rated I was there yesterday for Dinner and I was highly dissapointed with the quality of food served. We were two and we had fish for starters which was excellent and chicken shorba. For main course we ordered Dal Makhni which was good but biggest let down was the Chicken dish which we ordered chicken was hard and had no taste of spices and romali roti was hard and it was not freshly prepared. We just could not finish the food and we even started to feel pukish and decide to leave the place. We escalated to the gentlemen who was serving our table but only solution offered by him was replacement of dish and romali roti. Ended up paying around 3k without any satisfaction. We were planned to go to barbeque nation but could not get a seat and than we were thinking about pind baluchi but we liked the ambience of desi vibes and we decided to eat there but dissapointed with dinner. With such cutthroat competition in connaught place you would want customers to return to you. Best wishes,Rated 3.0,4,0,??

Nikhil Jain 'Nik',"Rated Been there for family dinner, I choose this particular restaurant because it was less like pub and more like a good authentic punjabi restaurant. The food is great I must say, the best North Indian food I ever had. The ambiance is pure punjabi, the seating, the staff, the bar(Theka) they call. I liked every bit of this restaurant. First restaurant which was flawless. Kudos to Desi Vibes. I suggest everyone to go there at least once Thank you.",Rated 5.0,41,68,??
Sarabjeet Singh,"Rated One of the best places to dine at Connaught Place, Desi Vibes has a traditional touch to its ambiance and food. They welcome you with a lemonade and some papad and I must say they mesmerised me with their lemonade to the extent that I had to request for it 2 more times. The amritsari fish tikka was fabulous and had a very soft texture. Even the chicken counterpart was great. I liked that they placed tomato shorba instead of soup to maintain the health benefits. The Amritsari chicken curry was one of its kind and as my friends quoted, ""It was unlike anything they had ever ate."" It's my personal recommendation to try it. The service is one of its kind and I would love to thank all the attendants for their service. And dinner was finally ended with complimentary Pan flavoured candies and a warm thank you. I would also recommend to carry an ICICI or HDFC card to avail extra 15% discount.",Rated 5.0,30,43,??
Nikita Choudhary,"Rated I went to this restaurant on a Sunday night. We were seated quickly (no waiting). The waiters were very polite. We were served a welcome drink (Shikanji) which was quite delicious. The whole theme/decor of the restaurant was cool. I could feel the Desi Vibes. The achaars that they served were delicious. We ordered 3 main dishes. Mutton Rogan Josh, Butter Chicken, Malai Kofta. All of these three were spectacular. The Chicken in butter chicken was so soft, it melted in my mouth and the blend of flavours was amazing. Same with the Malai Kofta..they actually serve 4 kofta pieces instead of the usual 2 that most restaurants serve. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is in the mood for some North Indian food. :)",Rated 4.5,3,0,??
Barkha Handa,"Rated I would give a 5 on 5 to the ambience; all Desi and vibrant. Since we were just two, we didnt encounter any problems with finding a table. We ordered the fish dish prepared in Amritsari way which was tender. My husband relished on it like a kid. The Gobhi Manchurian was nice and the Dal was okay. The Dahi Kababs were average. So all in all it would be a 4 from my side since some of the dishes were tasty and some were not.",Rated 4.0,19,52,??

FOODLE,"Rated this place carries a similar vibe to its noida branch,though it isn't congested or over-crowded like it. food is great as usual with awesome curries is both veg and non-veg. murg curry dhaba style and kadhai paneer are some of the best dishes desi vibes offers. they have improved their kebabs a lot.not only quality has improved,but quantity is worthy of the price. achari paneer tikka and banno murgh tikka were almost perfectly prepared. one thing it perhaps lag in is service.on surface service is good, but waiters are absent-mindedly responding to your requests with lot of mistakes in orders. it doesn't spoil the experiance but it does irritate the visitor. overall a great place with very competitive pricing for CP.most of the similar places in CP are selling shitty food for similar prices. this one stands out as a solid dependable choice for repeated dining.",Rated 4.0,20,44,??

In the same block there lies a restaurant with Desi look, where you will find the ambience similar to mud houses of village and 'Theka' on the place of modern bar.

We went with our family with 8 members Tried Ajwain Fish tikka - perfect Never order any soup it's dangerous.

Yamini Bhargava,Rated The place is similar to pind baluchi and other traditional punjabi touch places but the food is delicious and the best part is the pitara of achaar that the waiter came with.

The quantity of all d items was just about ok, more on d lesser side but gud enough for 4 of us....

Vrinda Vig,"Rated Desi vibes is one of the safest bet in cp on Saturday night for North Indian cuisine.. While all the other restaurants are over crowded this one made us wait only for 10 mins(which is quite less) So we were welcomed with nimbu pani as welcome drink and a platter of roasted papads.. Both were complementary and very tasty.. We ordered a veg seekh and murg platter for starters both were really yum.. Veg seekh is highly recommended... Also one item in murg platter that is murg malai tikka was extremely tasty.. We ordered malai kofta,chicken lababdar, naan, laccha parantha and the very tasty chur chur naan in main course.. Fresh lime soda was also nice. One really special thing is the variety of pickles they serve along with the main course.. Amazing? The mukhwaas or mouth freshener with paan is great..

Their food was mouth watering...especially the starters, which were damn hot and did justice to their taste. The services were a bit slow. They served jaljeera n small papad type chips...which was complimentary. Rest the dal tadka n dal makni were all great but the portions were small. We were fifteen people and had to order three four plates of few varieties especially starters.

Coming to food we ordered tandoori chaap, achari paneer tikka, some corns and mushrooms. They were really well served with onions. Starters were great. Then coming to main course dal makhni, shahi paneer and masala mushroom. Mushrooms and shahi paneer were really good but dal was just okay. Also tried mango lassi which was the best.

Richa Sharma,"Rated Went to Desi Vibes today with a friend. Althought it was a planned rendezvous, we were running a little late. So, didn't make any reservations. As expected, it was jam packed and we had to wait for good 15 minutes before we could find ourselves a table. The waiters were polite and courteous. The ambience was decent too. We were served the welcome drink on our arrival - as is the tradition (I have been to their Noida branch too). We quickly placed our order for the food. And it arrived well in time despite the peak hour rush. We ordered bhindi ki sabzi, dal makhani and raita. Since we were running short on time, we didn't have time for many delicacies. But whatever we ordered was good enough. Sweet dish was also fine. I just had one small disappointment. Zomato mentions about the 15% discount given on food ordered during lunch hours - between 12 noon and 4 pm. However, we didn't get any discount. On asking the waiter, he told us that it is meant only for Citibank customers. Well, if that's the case, then you should specify it right here. That was a little turn off. Rest all was fine - the ambience, the courtesy of the waiters, and the food :)",Rated 3.5,12,9,??

Namrata Chakraborty,"Rated I am extremely wary of going to typical Indian restaurants because I dread seeing the menu with the same old dishes given swanky names and shelling out huge sums for the typical meal. I am the ""Go to Kake-da-dhaba-for-butter-chicken"" kind of a person with the occassional exception of Moti Mahal. (Bukhara and Varq are a different story altogether. And so is Jama Masjid.) Desi Vibes, however, pleasantly surprised me. The menu is almost again the same story, old dishes with new names like Murg Banno Tikka (which I ordered as Banno Ka Tikka de dijiye bhaiya much to the horror of the one serving us)! But this place really delivers on the food front. Intense, authentic flavours and perfect accompaniments like laal mirch and methi parantha (proper ones and not ""methi/lal mirch sprinkled"" variants). But the real star is their selection of achaars which they bring in a basket and serve on the table. I loved the hari-mirch and adrak achaar but their Meetha achaar clean bowled me! The Bhuna mutton was intense as well. Desserts are pretty basic and limited. Nothing new in that department. Among other things, their welcome drink (shikanji) and baby papads are nice add-ons. Its a theme based restaurant so lots of interesting things to gaze at while waiting for your food. The pricing is absolutely justified and for a three course (non-veg) meal it was around 1100 per head for us. I'll definitely come back for the Achaars!",Rated 4.5,51,294,??

Vivek Saini,"Rated There are very few places that can cast a spell on you, the moment you enter. This restaurant is definitely among them. The ambience has been intricately done in the pind / country style and you just can't help admiring it. The staff if extremely swift and courteous, despite the place running at its full capacity. The food is amazingly delicious and cooked to perfection, which is evident in the first bite itself. The welcoming jaljeera drink and papad bites are wonderful to start with it. The whole experience is totally worth it, and this place is definitely worth multiple visits. Looking forward to dining there again soon!",Rated 4.0,79,119,??
Pratik Prasun,"Rated I've been hearing about Desi Vibes from a friend of mine since the last one year or so and he just couldn't stop rambling about its Noida outlet's delicious offerings. Finally I had the chance of visiting the place in Connaught Place last night and I must say, he was not wrong! Zomato recommends the DV's Dal Makhni as the 'must try' dish but I seriously insist visitors to try the Karara Hara Bhara Kebab and DV's Paneer Galouti.. Those are fabulous in their taste and texture, completely melting in the mouth in a few moments.. The ambience was also quite cheerful, wonderfully decked up to give a rich 'desi' feeling.I especially liked their system of offering different varieties of pickles through a handheld ensemble being carried from table to table. The main course was delicious, though I found something amiss in the paneer lababdar (hence not giving it a 5-star rating) but the dal makhni is highly recommended. It's a pity I couldn't try the non -veg dishes yesterday, but I'm definitely returning to the place for more!",Rated 4.5,23,19,??

The ambience was beautiful ; the walls were adorned with ethnic artifacts and gave a very ""chokhi-dhaani"" feel. The staff was very courteous and we were well taken care off. Pros - the ambience , staff , the assortment of pickles, welcome drink and breads , Soya chaap (try it for sure) Cons- small portions of food , the serving was a little haphazard . The quality of food (only tried vegetarian) was good but can be better. We were though charged a little extra but it was sorted out amicably.",Rated 3.5,30,165,??

Service : Service was good, prompt... but you can easily differentiate between the experienced and the amateur stewards. Food: Starters both non veg n veg kebab platter were good. Main Course was also good, the vegetarian dishes (Paneer Lababdar, banarasi Dum Aloo) we ordered were better than the non vegetarian dishes ( Murgh lababdar).

Mandhir Bhatia,"Rated Yesterday I visited Desi Vibes for the second time, but it was my first visit to this one at CP. I like the interiors of this place and seating was comfortable (more spacious than the one in Noida). We ordered Veg Platter for starters and it was delicious, sufficient for 4 people. For main we ordered, dum aloo, chap roganjosh and gobhi dish. Gobhi dish was the best. We little difference in the gravy preparation of the other two. Chap Roganjosh was below average. I ordered hari mirch parantha and it was great, missi roti was soft and nice. Overall it was a decent experience, but I'd still rate Desi Vibes Noida higher than this one. I'm more likely to go Noida if I decide to visit this place again.",Rated 4.0,11,33,??
Luni,"Rated Pretty average place. I had heard quite a bit about their Noida outlet, so had gone. Ambience is good. They have designed the place well. Food however is very very average. I am really having to hold myself back from writing terrible food. Boti kebab was so dry, would have liked it better if they named it Dry Meat. The size of those pieces were like toffees. But who can eat any bigger sized dried mutton anyway. Dahi ke kebab were fine. That is the only thing I can consider fine during the complete dinner. I hear Tandoori Chicken was good. I didn't eat. I was too disappointed by then. Makhani dal was over cooked. And bland. Button chicken was ok. Average. I ordered for chur chur paratha...first time in my life I saw a chur chur paratha with paneer topping. Nothing was chur chur in it. Quite sogged up. Had ordered for some lemon sodas. Mine was flat. When they re-did it, they added sugar in it. Asked me if it was now better. I had no words to say. Just accepted what I got. The achar concept is good. Would have been better if the person serving it had even a little desire to do so. It seemed he was rushing, didn't want to spend so much time serving 6 people, may be natures call?? That's about all. Overall average food experience. Oh ya, the welcome drink was nice. Welcoming indeed.",Rated 2.5,84,91,??

Aayush Agarwal,Rated I am giving one because zero is not possible on Zomato. The restaurant is run by big dumbheads. There is not a single person who is having a little common sense or a basic graduate even. We ordered food and liquor. On liquor they charged double incidence of VAT. First they charged 12.5% VAT on the entire bill amount including liquor and then they further charged 20% VAT for liquor. When we tried to make them see through their mistake there was not even a single literate person in the restaurant who can understand such a simple point. Utterly disappointing and frustrating.

Artifacts, stone age coins to purane jamane ke telephones etc. All seen for the first time. Regarding food there welcome drinks, pickles and the paan they give at the end is just out of the box. Dhai kabab, panners achari tikka, paneer labadar, chaap roganjosh, garli naan and stuffed parantha just yummy. Service very courteous, service staff dress very nice.

Nishant Arora,"Rated Delicious North Indian Food :) Went there on a Sunday noon, wasnt much crowded, ambiance is good with the retro style decor which gives Desi feel. The music was absolutely desi n fantastic. We ordered ""Bharwan Tandoori Tangri"" ( stuffed leg pieces, very finely cooked with alot of herbs n a little cream, must try) & ""Murgh Banno Tikka"" ( ginger n garlic flavoured tikka, great n melt in mouth). For main course we ordered ""DV ki khas Dal makhani"" ( so rich n full of flavour, absolutly delicious ) ""Murgh Kadhai Boneless"" ( not much different from the regular version but yummy it was) Accompanied with ""Garlic Naan"" ( crispy n loaded with garlic) and Tandoori Rotis (a little hard they were) and for drinks we ordered ""Aam-e-Khas"" ( chatpata n mast aam panna). Absolutely Desi experience we had starting from the decor to the seating then the cutlery and off course lajawaab desi yummy food :) Service was fast enough, just cutting a single point because when we entered, we were not told that they are about to wrap up soon, as we got seated and were about to place the order for starters, we were asked to decide for main course as well because that was the last order for Lunch time, they should have informed us the same when we entered and most of the desserts of their menu were finished. Rest all was an amazing experience :)",Rated 4.0,23,36,??
Shruti Jindal,Rated The place has a very nice ambience and decor. The best thing were the different types of achaar that were offered to us before the main course. We ordered bharva kumbh which was delicious. So were the veg biryani and dal makhani. However the churchur parantha was not very great and not as we were expecting and so not really a value for money. Rest everything was good.,Rated 4.0,13,12,??

Mridul Singh,"Rated One word to sum it up- chaos Ambience : ok, nothing very appealing. There are lot of options with much better desi ambience. Dining comfort: The place is very crowded and you can feel as if eating in a tea stall. They should definitely re-consider there seating arrangements. Food: Food is average with nothing very yummy or different to speak about. Staff: very courteous, but there is so much chaos. Multiple people taking order from one table...no serving order..and a state of panic. The place is so crowded that very often you have waiters bumping into one other and guests. Price: average not very expensive Table reservation : must. Waiting time is very high. The guy at reception has no idea how much time it will take. He simply says minimum 30 mins for everyone, but usually its more than an hour. Visit again : may be if things change for good",Rated 2.0,3,11,??
Ankit Jha,"Rated What We Ordered : Dal Makhani, Paneer Roganjosh, Pineapple Raita, Aloo-pyaaz Paratha, Butter Naan, Pudina Lachha Paratha and Rabri Overall Rating : Ambience and Decor-5/5 Food- 4/5 Service - 3.5/5 Presentation- 4/5 Value for money- 4/5 The Quickie : The first thing that impresses you about the place is the decor. The vibrant colours and the great music are instant mood - lifters. The staff is polite and courteous. However, the service isn't the most prompt (that was my experience). The menu offers a lot of options and the food is delicious...well cooked and presented. It tastes authentic and desi. Satisfied our palate thoroughly. The welcome drink accompanied by little round pappads is a nice touch. The place is value for money. Final verdict : Head to this place without thinking twice when you are craving delectable Indian food. I'm definitely going back. The Detailed Review : The place was packed on a Wednesday night and we had to wait a while to get in. The host was quick and found a table for our family of four within 10 minutes. The place has been done up creatively. There's a well at the entrance... artifacts and mementos from the bygone era adorn the walls. The decor is vibrant and colourful. Nice bollywood songs were playing in the background. Upon being seated, we were served the welcome drink of the day, The shikanji. It tasted quite good. We ordered the Dal Makhani, Paneer roganjosh, Aloo Paratha, Pudina Lachha Paratha, Butter Naan, Pineapple raita and Rabri. The Dal Makhani tasted great...it was the right blend of lentils, spices and butter. Paneer roganjosh was delicious too...The gravy was light and well seasoned...The Paneer chunks were soft. The quantities of the gravy and the Paneer were balanced. The Pineapple raita has to be the best I've tasted till now in my life. It was a little too sweet and had large chunks of pineapple in it. The whole thing worked beautifully together. The Aloo pyaz Paratha was done very well..it was well stuffed and well seasoned. So were the other two breads. They were a perfect balance of crisp and soft. The breads were served with a generous amount of butter. At the start of the meal, we were given a choice of pickles from a huge basket and I chose the raw mango and the garlic pickle. The raw mango was yummy. We ordered rabri for desert and were not disappointed. It was sweet, creamy and cold... loved it. The finger bowl came with a few rose petals in it...it was a nice touch. The service was a bit slow, probably due to the place being so crowded, which affected the experience. The portion size of each dish is enough for two ppl... not four. The whole meal costed us Rs. 1800, inclusive of taxes, which is quite decent, in my opinion. However, I'd like to add that the food was very good but not worth the hype that's being created around the place. Many other places serve equally delicious and some, even better Indian fare.",Rated 4.0,4,62,??
Parul Dudhatra,"Rated My friends birthday party was due from sometime and we finally went to desi vibes yesterday to celebrate and we thank our luck that we got a seat on a weekday there.

We were 4 people in total and we ordered karara hara bhara kabab, subz ka shorba, murg platter and drinks for everyone. The quantity was quite fulfilling for our apetite.

Yogendra Garg,"Rated We went to Desi Vibes for my wife's Birthday ! The food was superb! Their collection of pickles is also very interesting. Each of the dishes we ordered turned out to be different in terms of gravies and flavours which is a delight for the vegetarians find if eating out. The decor is rustic and adds to wonderful ambience. However, the service quality needs little tweaking. Our order for second round of breads took exceptionally long and the rotis which arrived were cold. Though later we were served reheated rotis, it was a mood spoiler for us on this special day. Another service related aspect is the bearers asking those of us sitting at end of the table to handover soiled plates even when ample space was available around the table for the bearers to pick up these soiled plates. If these aspects are taken care and their quality and pricing continues to be as they are, Desi Vibes can turn out to be a star attraction at CP !!!",Rated 3.5,5,48,??

Anjali Bokaria,"Rated I was really very excited for Desi Vibes, as when they were promoting their restaurant, a picture with tikkas served on coal iron was every where in social media. I had my hopes way up high. So, we were 8 people and we had to wait for almost an hour on a Monday evening too. There were no great arrangements for waiting area, later on they provided us with chairs outside. Once we had our table prepared, we were welcomed with complementary Aam pana and Papad. We ordered Shakahari kebab platter, Dal makhani, Chana masala, Kadaai paneer, tandoori roti, missi roti, butter naan, Jeera rice, gulab jamun, Missis Mocktail and Nimbu pani. Food was average in taste. Service was very slow and also they served us Mutton instead of Chana masala. They instantly realized what blunder they have done but Chana masala was served after we were done with our breads. Ambience is good. Interiors are done pretty well. Old and antique decoratives , musical instruments are put up on walls. Also a cycle is used as one of their displays. Staff was very polite but caught up in loads of orders leading to confusion.

To be honest, we decided to eat here only because the BBQ nation was completely jam packed. But soon desi vibes proved that everything happens for the good! :D Our experience here was good! The staff was very very polite! They were smiling and being as nice as they could be! Providing us with our food took a lot of time though. We had a frost bite mocktail, dahi ke kabab and paneer hariyali tikka as starters. Everything was fantastic! Kababs and tikkas were crisp and spicy; the drink was chilled and the green apple flavour was prominent. In the main course we had paneer labadbaar with churachura parantha which again was a good choice! ;) We left with a yummy tummy ! :D",Rated 4.0,43,450,??

The moment you enter the ambience will attract and you and more than the menu the ambience will keep you involved there small artefacts under the glass of dinner table will keep you engrossed.

Prarthna,"Rated The entire ambiance of this place justifies the name 'DESI VIBES'. As you enter, almost everything from the walls to the tables gives you such vibes that you feel you have actually landed up in some desi rustic punjabi dhaba. The walls are built in such a way and have those traditional designs made over them, then there are those kripans under the tables, and their bar is the center of attraction with the word theka written on top of it. Then we were served the welcome drink. Aam panna was a tangy drink that goes well with your taste buds. Refreshing it is. Along with the welcome drink, they serve you paapads. We ordered starters- Dahi kebabs had raisins and cashews making them sweet, i have had better dahi kababs at many other restaurants. Tandoori chaap was remarkable, soft and marinated with the right amount of spices. Then comes the main course. They serve you with a variety of pickles and chutneys. We chose to have lehsun pickle and baingan chutney, which is worth a mention. I had read a lot of good reviews about Aam ki chutney but it wasn't available. Dal makhani punjabi style was good. Palak paneer was upto the mark with soft, tender and juicy paneer. Chur chur naan was soft and had crushed paneer on top of it. Lehsuni naan had the right garlic taste required. Overall it was nice, just the service was a bit slow. It could have been better. I would recommend this place for outings with friends and family.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Kashish Mittal,"Rated Hi Team, I had a visit yesterday with my family of seven, just to try this place for which i had have a lot of buzz, the outdoor waiting arrangements were fine, but the better part be the manager ad team initiatives to accommodate people waiting outside smartly and quickly, We were given shikanji as the welcome drink, the food we ordered was a lot of variety only in vegetarian,. The service was really good, though there was little enthusiasm lacking in the servers, and at some places the response to a query was a little slow, it maybe because of the peak hours, The food quality was really lip smacking good, no second opinion about that, just the Indian breads little improvement was needed in terms of crispness of the breads, The ambience was also very positive and refreshing along with the decor, Overall Experience was quite good.

Varnali Dutta,"Rated Finally, after 3 monthsI'm writing this review of the wonderful place where I gave my birthday treat to all. I was allured by their interiors& conceptas shown in the pictures published by zomato during my search for perfect place for my special day.When we entered the restaurant, my friends and I were captivated by their beautiful presentation of an unusual concept. It felt like we have entered a house by the Indian countryside......................................................All of us were welcomed with a complimentary drink. Then, we ordered ""Butteyan Da Kebab"", ""Murg Methi Malai', ""Dahi Ka Kebab"", ""Murg Kali Mirch"" ,""Paneer Roganjosh"", Laccha Parantha"", ""Tandoori Roti"" & ""Missi Roti"".While, we were waiting for our order they served us complimentary mini papads and a waiter came along with a box full of savoury varieties of pickle. It reminded me of my old days when my dadi served me interesting varieties of homemade piquant pickles...............................By the time food arrived, everybody out of table etiquettes waited for everyone to be served but ""I can't resist anymore "" looks on their face betrayed them. Everything was cooked to perfection with a smooth blend of authentic flavours that paralysed our senses, especially ""DAHI KA KEBAB"". We had to order it again as it was an instant hit amongst all my vegetarian & non-vegetarian friends. The food here left all our mouths watering, wanting for more.................",Rated 4.5,13,42,??

As we went in, the ambience was simply WOW, amazing, truly desi having gobar n mud leppa with huge collection of artifacts. They served us jaljeera on entrance which was very refreshing. We ordered dahi kabab and zarkhi murg tikka, simply amazing and yummy. In main course we ordered dal makhni (which was the best ever), dhaba chicken and pineapple raita. All dishes 5/5. The breads we had garlic naan, laccha parantha and stuffed kulcha. All crispy. Service was with a smile. Icing on the cake was the pickles (specially began ki chatni) and paan they serve at the end.

Sanya,"Rated Desi vibes - Offers you typical north indian cuisine nothing extraordinary , just a village theme depiction. - lunch - ordered murgh shorba, amritsari tikka and roghan josh (on server recommendation, supposedly the best) - approx 1500 I went twice, the first time when it initially opened and now. Over a few months the quality has degraded substantially. The food was loaded with colouring and masala .I could not find flavours in any of the dish I ordered. The only good thing is the the complimentary pickle and mini papad. Do try their brinjal pickle, yes brinjal! As far as ambience is concerned, the place was smelling of mosquito spray and the Air conditioning was not working. So the ambience didn't work out either.

Comfortable as outstanding. Food delicious, the staff never gets irritated of anything , a smile is always there on there face. They will not say don't do this or do this. Like some of the so called bars and restaurants in cp do(ps: i will review them soon- they should be shut) . This place has it all - food , drinks, service, seatings, comfort & the indian look. It gives you a feel of sitting in an indian desi place with a well versed atmosphere.

Saloni Verma,"Rated Went there on my birthday with a group of 8 friends without reservation. It was a sunday. The staff was so warm. We got the welcome drink, a jaljeera of sorts upon arrival. That immediately made our appetite grumble for food. We ordered the classic butterchicken and the absolute heartthrob, rara chicken. Anyone who's reading this,take my word for this - go have the rara chicken at desi vibes, you'll never ever want to eat wholesome desi dishes anywhere else. Rara chicken coupled with their naans which had gracious butter coatings was delicious. Also, the staff was SO ADORABLE. when my friends and i cut my cake there,they figured it's my birthday. They gave me a complimentary photo frame as a gift even tho I hadn't made a booking at the place. It was a great day, thanks to desi vibes.

Shikha Kapoor,"Rated We visited this place yesterday for a family lunch, and as this is strategically placed in N block of CP (one of the happening places in CP) we had to wait for 25 mins to get a table. Though they ensure that shikanji is served to people waiting in the scorching heat. Coming the food I would say it wasn't that great, dal makhni was absolutely bland, paneer tikka masala was not at all soft, murg makhani was decent but not great. Breads were also okay, thus, overall this place is not something I would go back to as I think there are better options available in and around CP for north indian food. Service:- Disastrous, either they cannot handle so many people or they are just lousy in their service. We had to wait for 5 to 7 minutes for someone to attend us and provide us with the menu, after taking the order, these guys took 20 minutes to get the food.

Anuj Aggarwal,Rated Desi Vibes Is a Perfect North Indian Family Resteraunt !!! What Makes You Like the Place is its Interiors and Box Of Collections !! Each and Everything put up in the place is picture perfect !! Staff is Courteous Too.. But A Resteraunt No matter How Beautiful it is Will always Be Judged On its Food Too.. and This Is the Area Probably DV Lacks !! I ordered a Mango lassi Which was descent followed by a Kebab Platter ... I was so damn disappointed by the Kebab Platter That I was Not able to Order anything after it !! 4 out of 5 variety Served In it was Not Good at all or lets say Only Mushroom Tikka Was Fine Rest All Had Some Flaw Or Other.. Hara Bhara Kebab Was Dry as Hell.. Other Kebab Was Almost raw.. Bharwan Aloo Was burnt.. Galouti Kebab Was good But it was Served Cold !!

Abhi.rupak,"Rated This is my first review for any restaurant on Zomato and no wonder I am writing this because I was so over-whelmed that day, when I visited, this particular place. I chose this place for dine-in on my fiancee's birthday, never expected that my decision will turn out to be so perfect later on. As soon as we settled inside Desi Vibes, our eyes went all round the corner to explore how beautifully the restaurant was setup. The ambiance was perfect with dim lightings and soft music playing in the background which was so soothing to our ears. Also the atmosphere was filled up with some sweet aroma that could lift up anyone's mood. At first we were greeted with Jaljeera/aam panna and masala papads. Then we ordered dahi k kabab and tandoori aaloo. Dahi k kabab was really good but tandoori aaloo was ok ok. For main course we ordered Paneer tikka masala and Malai kofta and both were amazing, very delicious. But this was not it. What impressed me so much about this restaurant was yet to unfold. After we finished our dinner I wanted to celebrate my fiancee's b'day. So I went up to a person(who looked to me the supervisor/head) and gently asked if I could cut the cake which I had brought, to which he very politely replied ""Yes Sir! You can. No problem"" :) After that he also offered us help in unwrapping and putting the cake on a plate. I had forgotten to buy candles, so he had put candles too. While we celebrated cake cutting and b'day song he clicked so many pictures for us. And even if all this was not enough, in the end he also presented my fiancee a gift from his side which left both of us awestruck. In the end when we were leaving, everyone, from people who were serving to supervisor and owner himself wished us goodbye. I was so delighted that day, to see my fiancee feel so special and happy. ThankYou Desi Vibes! Needless to say that we will visit you again very soon.",Rated 5.0,2,1,??
Sidharth Sunish,"Rated Situated in N block near to the barbeque nation, this restaurant is similar to Pind Baluchi in many ways but has a distinct flavour to it which puts it above Pind Baluchi in many respects. The ambience of the restaurant is typically village as the theme suggests with many old artefacts like old telephones, knives, locks decorating the wall. The music is smooth and rustic in nature and adds to the already earthy feeling. The food is really good even though the service was a little slow for us. But the management's apologies for it really helped. As soon as we sat down we were served a complimentary Jaljeera and masala papad. We ordered a plate of dahi ke kabab, paneer makhani masala and panch ratan along with tandoori rotis. Before serving the food we were shown 9 different varieties of pickles and each was better than the other in taste.@ The dahi ke kaba were soft, the rotis were hot and crisp, the paneer was smooth but it was the panch ratan that hit the sweet spot. Every Ingredient's taste burst in your mouth with the right amount of spice. With a budget of 1000 for 2 persons this place is really one of the gems in cp.

I really like their concept of serving different varieties of complimentary pickles, the soft background music that they play which creates a very refreshing ambience and obviously the food that they offer. Their different (but limited) varieties of mutton gravy, garlic naan and stuffed naan are worth a try. Even their butter chicken is pretty good. My only concern is that during my last visit, the food was good but not upto the standard which I have started to expect from this place. I am just hoping it was an off day and would really wish for them to maintain the standard which they had set initially.",Rated 4.0,6,70,??
Prakriti,"Rated Amongst the cluster of restaurants in CP's N block lies Desi Vibes. It is just opposite to Barbeque Nation. The interiors are quite similar to what one would find in an outlet of Pind Balluchi. But while the latter has a typically Punjabi setup, Desi Vibes beautifully blends Punjabi and Rajasthani elements. Truly desi. Thatched roofs over the seating areas, daggers and other artefacts on display make it the perfect place for a comfortable and air conditioned desi experience. As you sit down and pore other their menu, the present a small plate of tiny papads to munch along. Soon after comes a kulhad of Shikanji which is quite refreshing. I tried their Chicken Tikka, Paneer Tikka and Chicken Biryani. The Paneer was soft and adequately spiced. Loved the green chutney! Chicken biryani was not good. It looked quite tempting but the flavor fell flat. Chicken Tikka was simply awesome. Perfectly marinated, well grilled, juicy; one of the best chicken Tikkas I have had. Presentation was not very great and therefore the dip in ratings.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The food is delicious and great in taste and Dal Makhni with aloo-pyaas parantha is must have. I have visited Desi Vibes twice in 15 days and i would make special mention of Bhaan Singh and Dewan(staff) who were extremely courteous and cordial with a pleasing personality and helping attitude.A place becomes great with food and staff and Desi Vibes has both. I would recommed you make prior reservations as there is waiting(30 mins and more) on weekends. p.s.:Yesterday, it took about 15 minutes for billing due to some system failures. but, the team gave us a goody to apologise for the inconvenience.

Akshay Sethi,"Rated The place scores well for the ambiance and service. The restaurant has nice rustic interiors, probably a notch better than Pind Ballauchi. The service is fast & prompt, and they greet you with a warm namaste. However, that's just about it, no amount of great ambiance or great service can make up for the food. We ordered Veg & Non Veg Platter, and the snacks were just average. Main course was even worse, with even a small take away joint offering better taste. They goofed up our order, where they got Paneer Lababdar, instead of Paneer Tikka Masala. When we cross checked, the waiter blatantly lied, saying this is Paneer Tikka Masala indeed, but the taste was a dead giveaway. We also did not create a fuss, as it would have taken another 30 mins to get the dish replaced. Although, they took ages to get the main course, the preparation did not seem like that it should have taken this long, maybe it took time because of the weekend rush. In hospitality language, this was a classic ""Jhatka"" preparation, with almost similar gravy used for both Paneer & Chicken.",Rated 2.5,1,58,??

They gave us complimentary shikanji and papads to start with. We ordered a tomato shorba, stuffed mushrooms, tadka dal, paneer lababdar, rotis and a peshawari parantha. The stuffed mushrooms were bland, didn't like the parantha too much and we got dal makhni instead of the tadka dal we ordered (and it was a little too salty). The soup was great and the paneer was really good too. It was pretty good overall. There were three of us and it cost us around 1700.",Rated 3.5,2,83,??

They have a huge menu, so it ll take time for you to decide what you want to try on the first visit. We ordered tandoori chaap as a starter and dal makni, paneer kadai and naan, roomali roti. The starter was unexpectedly tasty, chaap being so soft and juicy. The main dishes were also worth the taste. Roomali roti being not like roomali, naan were good crisp.

Kshitij Aggarwal,"Rated Being a fan of the Noida outlet, I was glad to find Desi Vibes in Connaught Place. Went there a few times and must say I was not disappointed. 1. Food: The food is great. We tried the regular North Indian choices: Dal Makhani, Kadhahi Paneer etc. and the quality was good. Though I would still rate Noida outlet higher, this one meets expectations quite well. The usual welcome drinks, pickels are served and give a nice start to the eating experience. They now have a bar labelled as THEKA. Nice desi touch everywhere. Since I am a vegetarian, would not know about the non-vegetarian food but my friends were all praises for the chicken dishes they ordered. 2. Service: The staff sports Desi Vibes' signature politeness and is very courteous. The wait for the order to arrive is slight long but nothing to complain about. 3. Ambience: The best part about Desi Vibes is the ambience. The decor and music are just perfect. The music they play perfectly goes with the setup and environment. Every time I walk in it feels like I have entered some royal eatery from the bygone era. Look for collection of old items inside the tables and on the walls.If your ever need to figure out which restaurant to go to, Desi Vibes is your best bet in Connaught Place.

The staff actually put in all the efforts to make us feel comfortable. The whole experience of being treated like a king (or should i say a queen) is what defines it. The bonus points?? Bonus points to the big box of pickle jars which would definitely remind you of the handmade pickles made by your grandmothers. Also, being welcomed with a shikanji glass and small papads. What we ordered?? Chaap-do-pyaza, DV ki Khas Dal Makhani, butter naan, chur chur paratha, stuffed paratha, nimbu soda. The dish that stood out??

With my pre booking we had no troubles in getting the table, I was delighted to see the outlet in CP is bigger than Noida and the ambience is also better, the old antique style furniture with vibrant colors lighting works well for my eyes. It was my birthday and I had checked with them at the time of reservation if they would provide a cake to which they were prompt and happy to provide one, the owner himself came to our table and checked if we were comfortable and asked at what time we need the cake, it was nice to see his courteous behavior and friendly nature. I asked him to get the cake first and he get it himself with a small birthday gift, everyone in my family was surprised to see the unexpected gift and checked with me if that person is my friend? :-) (Though it was a small gift but i definately liked it) we then ordered for snacks; dahi k kabab, paneer tikka and soups, dahi k kababs is a must have and paneer tikka and soup was pretty ok, they took some extra time in providing the order (main course way too long) which was a disappointment. In main course we ordered for dal makhni, shahi paneer and malai kofta.. Everything was served hot and tastes good but before the main course Desi Vibes USP strikes back with variety of pickles, mango, lemon, khajoor, ginger, eggplant, green chilly, kathal and what not, everyone in family loved it.

Ordered the standard fare of North Indian dishes. Every dish was really good. Especially the dal. Chicken was well cooked and well spiced. What we did like was the huge array of pickles and spices they offer while you dine. A server comes around with a box of pickles that you can choose. Service is good too. But nothing new or off the charts with the place. It's a rehash of our regular food fare served in this part of the country. But it's well done. So no complaints. The only thing is that the choice of music should be worked upon. I mean playing Bollywood dance numbers and club music during the day is a bit strange!anyway..

So coming to the food, we ordered nawabi chicken tikka, chicken rara and makhni naan Nawabi chicken tikka tasted average and some pieces were undercooked Chicken rara- chicken was tender, juicy, nicely blended with spices. I would rate it 3 out of 5 Naan- naam were soft, perfectly cooked n had multipal layers (nan with layers inside is kinda rare) so naan would get 4.5/5 Overall a nice experience, but they need to work on their food!!",Rated 3.5,44,59,??

Vikrant Arora,"Rated We were to meet one of our friends over dinner at C.P. but we are not experts when it comes to restaurants at C.P so we asked them to decide on any restaurant and we shall go with whatever they would suggest. They recommended Desi Vibes and we were pretty ok with the same. The place was crowded but we got a table as we had a prior booking. The ambience and feel was similar to that of Pind Balluchi, nothing extraordinary or worth mentioning. For starters we ordered Tandoori Chaap and murgh tikka. For the main course we ordered both Veg and non veg dishes. The food was pretty average and not impressive. There are definitely better places even in C.P. so can't think of a reason to come over a second time.",Rated 3.0,44,197,??

Since it was Friday we were expecting it to be crowded and had to wait for 10-15 mins but to our surprise it took only 2 mins. The place was full with families and the staff ushered us to our place. The ambiance is based on rural punjab theme with Desi stuff and other things similar to pind Bellucci. We were given a welcome drink(shikanji) We ordered paneer tikka masala and dal makhni along with roti... The staff was attentive and nice. We didn't had to wait for long before our food came The portions were adequate and the taste was satisfactory. A bit too low on the spicy side.

Kamal Arora,"Rated The decor here is truly desi. A made up village type of interiors done with alot of details. My only complaint is that this place is so hidden and can easily be missed by other restaurants in same complex. The management should put up a bigger hoardings for this place. Now coming to food. I judge any north indian place by their three dishes- Chicken Tikka, Butter Chicken and Dal Makhani. If these three are good, then the place is a hit for me. So keeping my testing standards same, I ordered these dishes. Dal tasted very well, and same for chicken malai tikka. Butter chicken was amazingly tasty and was in huge quantity.

What attracted me most is their good service, as the waiter served us food it took us a while to start our lunch, as we were waiting for few more friends to join in. By the time we were about to start our lunch waiter came in and offered to warm up the cold food on the table. That was something rarely to be seen in any of the restaurant.

We went with their signature dal makhni, which was worth it, and paneer rogan josh and dhaba style chicken in the main course. Each dish had a distinctive taste and was very enjoyable with the warm and perfect naan and roti. The chur chur parantha deserves special mention and is not to be missed.

Abhijeet Sengupta,"Rated Here is a tip for a lifetime: a restaurant is as good as their Non-Veg platter! In this case, average. Decor was okay, so was the service. If you know CP, you can't miss this place, right next to Barbeque Nation. They serve you a welcome drink, apparently a jaljeera-aam panna based concoction, on arrival. Apart from the non-veg platter, we ordered their signature stuffed chicken parantha, rarha chicken and fresh lime soda. Not much to hop around for, I have had much better. It seemed as if the restaurant is on an internship in Connaught Place, as is the case with many 'fly-by-night' joints mushrooming in CP, who make whatever profit they can and then disappear without a trace.

And the basket did not disappoint. Had the 'Baingan ka Murabba' 'Karela' and 'Garlic Pickle'. Believe me, it should not be missed. I was so happy I had those. 'Garlic Naan' was beautiful too. The service is phenomenal. It's quicker than anywhere I've been to, in recent times. And they are very very polite. I'm glad to have found this place in CP. Thank you, Desi Vibes.

To have a punjab wali feel u don't have to go to Jalandhar, Ludhiana or Amritsar & not even to Murthal just this is the right destination in the heart of Delhi. Firstly, we were served with Shikanji as our welcome drink(although was not much cold) but we Indians love ""FreeKaMaal"" ? Secondly, I am fond of Dal Makhani & they serve one of the best Dal Makhani's i have in my life. Thirdly, my friends ordered some Chicken Dish & even they appreciated its taste.

Pragya Gupta,"Rated I had been a fan of desi vibes, noida and so in the anticipation visited the CP one. I took my family along who had not tasted the food at any of their branches earlier and I kept their spirits high by praising it. It was sunday night and we reached there at 9.20pm and there was quite some waiting. People kept adding and we had 4th number on waiting list and told tgat we had to wait for 15-20 mins which we thought was ok. Not to mention they have less seating space. They accomodated all tge families with more number of members which even came after us since we were only 4 in number. We waited for 1hr 15 mins, on which I would say their system is quire stupid to accomate people and manage the waiting. I also told them that my mother wasnt feeling well which they dint even acknowledge and we also had no option to take her to other restaurant. After all the wating we finally ordered food and mind you i was quite disappointed. I already had my favourite dishes in mind and none if them tadted the same as they do on noida outlet.

Ruchi & Gaurav Rawat,"Rated Our Rating - 4/5 Summarized review for people in hurry : It's a place if you really want to have Punjabi food with an ambiance that reflects it. The music is neither too loud nor too soft and appropriate for a chit chat with friends and family. They have a good playlist hence one won't get bored here even if he/she isn't talking much. A recommended place for those who are in or around Connaught Place and hungry. Their starters as well as main course both are worth trying for. They don't serve alcohol as of now, but by the end of a week or so, they'll start that too! Detailed Review : The weekends this time took us to the cynosure of food and history that is Connaught Place Delhi. Walking down the historical promenade and the Indian flag fluttering in the background tickled our taste glands for savoring Indianess. So we headed to place that breathes of it ""Desi Vibes"". The restaurant is a living Punjabi village in the heart of the capital, graced by a polite staff and if you're lucky enough to meet the owner there Mr. Rajat Goyal, who is very amiable and provides a great company. Everything there is made up by hand of local artists. From walls made up of cow dung to warli painting, from tables to theka (bar) to even the washrooms creating what is closest to an earthen ambiance. Picking up on the right facets that make a great restaurant is important and well Desi Vibes does that to perfection. As soon as you enter, ""Jaljeera"" is served as a complimentary welcome drink which is a really nice gesture because of three things : 1. The small ceramic glass they serve in keeps the jaljeera cool even if you drink after sometime and of course it's cute in looks. 2. It's so hot in delhi that people generally prefer to have something really cold to cool their mind be it water or jaljeera of course. 3. The taste of it is what mom makes at home. To begin with we ordered two starters and two main course dishes along with naan. They serve in nice ceramic plates, hand painted. And their dish bowls are either handi or matka's and that too hand painted again. The reason they made everything by hand is because children like the feel here, typical Punjabi types and everyone enjoys eating food here. Also this place is the closest to foregone villages in the metropolis that you will find in and around Delhi. Our Order: [Starters] 1. Kebab Platter which had two types of kebabs, one was chicken seekh kebab and another was chicken tandoori kebab. The seekh kebab were perfectly made, they were nice soft and the pudina chutni along with it gave a perfect taste to it. The chicken tandoori kebab on other hand was left a little uncooked first but then as I mentioned, the staff here is polite and friendly and they offered us to change and bring it back for us. This is something appreciable because such small gestures can bring back a huge positive impact on a customer's mind. 2. We then ordered stuffed chicken tangri. At first we were shocked to know what this is and exactly how they will make it. On tasting the same, we couldn't control on stopping, we just ate it quickly because it was that yummy. It was stuffed with Keema. So just imagine - a chicken tangri stuffed with Keema. What a great combination. Bravo! 3. We also ordered two fresh lime soda with a cherry at the bottom. Somehow the taste of the same was different, not too sweet, not too sour and was made perfectly. Sweet lime soda is our signature mocktail that we order mostly everywhere. [Main Course] 4. We ordered Dal makhani which is my favorite in vegetarian food, Rara Meat and along with that we had garlic naan. While you begin eating your main course a sweet sour and tingling surprise is bestowed in the form of an array of pickles. Do try the Baigan pickle there is really a slew to chose from.I am sure you will be pleasantly surprised by the variety and the taste. [Tip : they also gift pickles to you to take home ;)] I know garlic naan is very common but this was the first time in my life that I ate garlic naan. And trust me it was tasty. I could smell and feel the garlic in my mouth that I could have actually eaten that without any vegetable. Dal makhani was yum, reminded me of my mami ji because that's exactly how she makes it. It was soft, creamy and tasty. Rara Meat - Again a great combination. Lamb cooked in yogurt and curry spices with minced meat. I have no words to describe it. It was DELICIOUS! The lamb was so perfectly cooked with the pieces just melting in your mouth with each bite. The best we ever had. At then end of it all they treat you with refreshments, there signature pan and a lovely supari made our of Khajoor [Dates]. Do try out this place! It's in Noida and Connaught Place also at N block. Thank you team for the amazing lunch! We'll definitely come back again. food.pixelsorcery.in",Rated 4.0,95,276,??

Sharmeen Khan,"Rated After Noida, Desi Vibes comes to central Delhi. To start with, they have a great decor which is truly impressive. Antique locks, hand-printing blocks, bicycle with a milk can and measure, all have been used very aesthetically to give this restaurant a warm and unique ambience. Wherever you see, you will find unique antique items adorning the walls or the crevices. The smiling and courteous staff welcomes you with a tangy and sweet drink, papad and a vast variety of pickles which are brought to the table in small jars all placed inside a large basket.The food is awesome. Must try the Chicken Platter which had a variety of kebabs and barbecued chicken. The quantity was enough for my family of three adults. We also liked their Dal Makhani very much. The portions are small and pricing done accordingly. For my family, the portions were just enough so there is no wastage. It is better when a restaurant offers a smaller portion at a lesser price rather than have a large portion which is impossible to finish by a small family. I am strictly against wastage of food so I prefer smaller portions. This way you also get to taste more dishes instead of trying to finish off one large dish. Since we went on a Saturday night, we had to wait for a good 45 minutes before we could get a table. Weekdays may be better.

Amongst the dishes that we ordered (vegetarian), the kebab platter was decent, the biryani wasn't that good, paneer lababdar was fine, dal makhani was excellent and we ended up unsatisfied with the breads. They had a special box for pickles with 12 different varieties to choose from as an attraction. All in all its a decent place, but it might not fit in your list if you are looking out for exceptional food.",Rated 3.5,108,434,??
Shivani Sharma,"Rated Decorated with beautiful magentas and blues, golden and wooden, a place must visit for its ambience and customer service. Menu is elaborate but food is bland. Don't expect a chicken mutton keema parantha to be juicy and spicy. It's dry and bland. Soya chap looks amazing but again it's bland. Don't forget to check out the pickles offered. Great variety, great taste. But you don't go to a restaurant only for the ambience, pickles and good customer service, right? You go to satisfy your taste buds. Taste kahan hai?",Rated 3.0,27,31,??
Ashok Mandal,"Rated it just happened to me while searching for a good North Indian cuisine....and the big board flashing Indian cuisine indian style was in front. Located on 2nd floor of the busy N-block, with a guy who escorted me from ground floor wearing an ethnic dress. the vibes started to come with a beautiful facade giving a village look and as we entered we were politely greeted and the ambiance was set with beautiful interiors and soothing music. we were 8 persons and ordered dahi kabab, achari paneer tikka, zarki murg tikka and mirchi murg with mango lassi . In the meanwhile the welcome drink..'lemonade' and papad was served to keep you busy while the order comes. The starters were really soft and upto the expectation and went well with lassi. For maincourse we ordered murg curry dhaba style , rara meat, paneer roganjosh and khas dal makhni which was served on time and the handi's went well with the theme. Great Food...ambience...hospitality..and service...Keep it up !!!!! Just WOW",Rated 5.0,0,6,??
Gurneet Kaur,"Rated I was looking for a restaurant to celebrate my parent's 25th Anniversary. Nothing OTT or super expensive but perfect for a quiet family dinner. All my previous plans of going to the Noida DV never materialized. So when I heard that they are opening in CP, I knew this shall be the restaurant. Located right opposite KFC in CP, its located on the second floor. While getting a reservation, they were kind enough to offer me a 15% discount as it was my parents' anniversary. A very sweet gesture! The ambience is very elaborate with attention paid to the little details. Overall the feel is very 'desi'. Thumbs up! Though the restaurant is not very big but the tables are at an appropriate distance to maintain privacy. As soon as we occupied our table, we were served a 'shikanji' as our welcome drink in these kulhads. Seasoned well. For starters we chose the khas dahi k kebab as suggested by the staff. Five portions of the kebab. It was so soft that it literally melts in the mouth. Super soft. The yoghurt was fresh n I could only imagine the effort that went in its preparation. Must order! Next we tried the tomato shorba. Very good consistency. Seasoned well. No added flavors. My mum loved it because of its freshness so again a thumbs up. For the mains we ordered the DV dal mKhani Punjabi style: Not for the calorie conscious. Loaded with butter. Really delicious! Makhni machhi: non spicy, excellent gravy. Thick and again seasoned well. Four big pieces of fish. Very soft. More than sufficient for two people. For the breads we chose tandoori roti and lehsuni roti. The latter is a treat for all garlic lovers. A lot of garlic but not too much Along with the mains we were served a wide variety of pickles made for DV in Bhatinda. I loved the bhartha murraba, lehsun pickle and green pickle. The pudina chutney served is spot on! A large portion of onions loaded with vinegar is served on the table. What else could an onion lover like me ask for! For dessert we were served rasmalai and vanilla ice cream. My mother is a diabetic but she couldn't resist eating the entire scoop. That's how good the vanilla ice cream was. The rasmalai was very fresh n soft! What an amazing way to end the meal. The masala chai was just like home prepared tea. At the end we were served paan, khajur and saunf. Throughout the evening, the staff was smiling while serving. It made the entire experience more pleasant. Everyone in the staff came to wish my parents which was very sweet. They even gave my parents a gift which was a super sweet gesture! At the end, I could see my parents smiling n that said it all. My dad even mentioned the fact that such amazing taste at this price is amazing Must try for the food and the hospitality without spending a lot of money.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Tushar,"Rated Went here with a lot of hope, and no doubt the taste was decent but on the blander side. I don't think I've eaten such heavy Indian food in my life. Everything was too creamy for my liking. Don't think I'll crave this kind of rich food for a while.",Rated 3.0,71,49,??
Chashmish Reviews,"Rated Ill tell you a little later how Desi Vibes served me the tastiest yet inimitable North Indian food, but first, let me tell you about how I met Delhis nicest manager on this afternoon. The moment we entered, the head waiter got us a comfortable seating. The Manager then came walking upto our table asking if the AirCon temperature was appropriate. It seemed okay at that moment since we had entered the restaurant from scorching heat. After 10 minutes, when we got comfortable with the Welcome drink, the Jaljeera and the Amritsari papads with Kachchi Ambi Pickles, I requested the Manager to adjust the temperature of the AirCon as it was getting chilly. The Manager smiled as if he knew what was coming to him and adjusted the temperature. When the food was served, he made sure to ask aus if the food was okay and if were enjoying it. Well, a lot of managers ask if youre comfortable. But he enjoyed serving his customers and making sure everyone had a good time. He was really polite in talking to my Mom about the food, if she needed a bowl for the Dal and Raita (which usually no staff asks about). Desi Vibes, ideal for family lunches and dinners, may appear like our very old Pibd Balluchi but trust me its really different. Located on the second floor, above Starbucks, Outer Circle, CP, you should be ready for a parking issue. They offer reservations too so you may take note of that too. Theyre open 7 days a week, till 12:30 AM so you can enjoy casual dining as per your convenience. Food is something you should definitely be looking forward to. With so many restaurants opening up in every knack, it is hard to find good quality food along with flavors. Desi Vibes will sure pleasure your taste buds with their reluctant spices and added love. Of what we ate for lunch, Dahi Ke Kebabs, Hari Bhari Mirch Ki Kadhi, Mix Raita, Dal Makhni, Lachhha Parantha, Butter Naan, Chhachh, Sweet Lassi & Sweet Nimbu Paani are what I liked. The dahi ke kebabs they serve are tender, fresh and will melt in your mouth. Served with green chutney and pickled onion rings, I can still taste the Dahi Ke Kebabs in my mouth writing this review. The Dal even after 20 minutes of being served was piping hot. The Hari Bhari Mirch ki kadhi was different and filled with paneer. Well combined with some spices, both the main course dishes were highly satisfying. We also tried the mix raita which was appropriately cold and thick for our taste. For breads, we had Lachha parantha (it was okayish, I have had better), Butter Naan (quite buttery and soft) and Tandoori Roti (average). What came as a surprise was the Pandora of Pickles! Yes, while the main course food is being served, you will be presented with a box full of different types of pickles, hence, Pandora of Pickles They have different types of Mango, Lemon, Karela, Baingan & Garlic Pickles. We tasted all of them and each of them was different and really tasty. The temperament of the place is satisfying. Look like the staff has a good time serving their customers. Theyre not only dressed neatly, they are totally dedicated to catering your needs. During a Sunday afternoon, being flooded with groups of families and friends and managing to keep a smile on the face is commendable On asking about the Wi-Fi, our attendant happily called the Manager and he was kind enough to put in the password and let me use Wi-Fi hassle free. Theres an atmosphere in antiques here. So watch out! On Zomato, the management has mentioned about a complimentary dessert during 12.6 PM lunch hours from 9 Apr- 30 Apr, 2015. But we didnt get any dessert. Although our attendant did ask if we wanted to order any desserts, on our refusal, there were no further talks. I would love to visit again but this time for dinner as I want to see how the dcor is lit up during evenings. Thanks Desi Vibes for a lovely lunch chashmishreviews.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Tushar Mangl,"Rated Food and ambience is as good as Noida Desi Vibe but service. Pathetic. Specifically asked the guy to hold the main course till we are finished with starters. He got both starters and main course together. Then again requested him thrice not to bring cold paranthas and get them changed. He kept lying he would change them, but 15 minutes after our starters we called the main course. Same tray was brought to us with cold lacha paranthas. And the same lies that they have been changed. Pathetic. You don't expect this from a fine dining service. Starters took some time to come. That's OK. Happens. Asked for ice in a drink and had to wait 10 minutes just for one cube of ice. On zomato its written about free complimentary dessert but when asked they pretended they had no clue whatsoever. I then said its on Zomato they hushed and all then are like its just one scoop of ice cream. Would you like to have it? Almost pleading to me to say no. Stick to Noida one I say until they get the house in order",Rated 3.0,5,2,??

Sipping our complimentary shikanji from a kulhad, ordered dahi kebab and achari paneer tikka for starters, dal makhani, paneer lababdar, veg biryani for main course with tandoori butter roti and chur chur naans. Achari paneer tikka and Biryani was average. Dahi k kebab, dal makhani and paneer lababdar were really nice. So was chur chur naan. They offer an interesting variety of pickles.

Garima,"Rated Totally Desi! This newly opened place in cp is a delight for north indian and mughlai food lovers. The place is a little difficult to find as it is on the second floor and no proper hoardings are displayed. The place is beautifully decorated in the traditional village type style which is enchanting. As we entered, we were served jaljeera as a complementary welcome drink which was refreshing. Then they quickly came up with another plate which had small cookie type papad served with pickles to keep us busy while the food was prepared. We ordered murgh mirchi platter, kadhai murg and chicken biryani. Everything tasted very good and homelike. The quantity served is pretty decent. If you are a north indian food lover, desi vibes is a place to go! I just feel the biryani could have been better because it lacked the richness of mughlai cuisine. Desi vibes will keep surprising you with their yummy complementary food stuffs. They came up with a huge box and offered us various kinds of chutney and morabba. The baigan ka morabba is just a way too goood!! If you happen to go there, it is a must try! The staff is very decent and courteous. I must say Desi vibes has a very unique and nice playlist playing in their restaurant which gives a soothing feeling while you eat your food.

The restaurant already has competition from already established restaurants in the area and needs to improve a lot to sustain it.Very difficult to spot the restaurant. The restaurant is much smaller than it's NOIDA counterpart. Not more than 12 tables. Smaller size should mean better service which isn't the case. We were 3 and the guy gave us a table suitable for 6 with bench on one side and 1 chair on another. Started well with welcome drink and papads, but then it went all downhill. Ordered starters which were served after 45 mins. The place had group booking and the chef was busy serving them and forgot others who were there. Main course came minus a dish, the waiter had forgotten to ask chef to prepare it. The food was average. Ordered Kali mirch chicken tikka which tasted more like normal malai tikka.
