Kanikananda89,Rated I feel this place is a little overrated.. I mean its nice and food is average.. Nothing motivating enough to turn your taste buds again to the place..,Rated 3.5,16,11,??
Nimish Kapoor,Rated Worst experience I have ever had.....!! Bad Food.... sorry worst Chicken Tikka.....!! I was seated downstairs and all the seats were vacant on the roof when I asked them to please let me be seated on the roof top they refused and said the seats are reserved but it was not so the guy who was busy distributing the seats was so arrogant and was least bothered about my concern. I will never ever recommend anyone to be dere trust me guys its not worth spending your sat & sun night Worst service I could ever imagined,Rated 1.0,1,21,??
Saurabh Kochhar,Rated Been here many time. Foo here never disappoint us. Love the food here though Ambience is pretty ok. Must try tempura and butter chicken,Rated 4.5,5,0,??
Chandan Biswas,Rated The roof top service seems to be very slow. But the food presentation was indeed impressive. The music selection was very bad. Needs improvising on a lot of factors for good.,Rated 3.0,22,255,??
Sonali Ahluwalia,Rated One of the best experiences ever! The ambience is very comforting and warm with a friendly staff. The thing that first hit me about this place was that it has 6 cuisines in total which makes its menu very vast but in turn it gets damn hard to decide on the food. Anyways the interior is very vibrant and intense. I liked the upper floor better than the main floor. The food tasted good but the service could have been better.

Shriti Dey,"Rated Last month i went kinbuck 2 for lunch i ordered ciorb de pui ( chicken soup) and pizza. the service I would say is very well managed and the servers are helpful with the menu and ordering, they provide good food at reasonable price and the service is good. The pizza is also great with its base not too thin and not to thick. Overall it decent place for a lunch date.",Rated 4.5,9,167,??
Prarthna,"Rated Not really impressed by the place. Although people have told me long tales of their visits here, my experience remains quite insignificant. AMBIANCE- It is the only good thing. Go here for the ambiance and nothing else. Still I would say there are a lot of other places in CP with better ambiance and breathtaking rooftops than their's. FOOD- Totally a no no to the food here. Soup was just okayish, Quesadillas were just not tolerable. Saviour of the day was pizza- only for the pizza, the rating. With limited options among desserts, we settled for waffles with vanilla ice cream. Soggy they were, literally soggy and lacking flavour. SERVICE- Tooooooooooooo slow. My advice is, order all your food in one go, because they take really too long to get you the order. Must mention, the time when I went only one table apart from ours was occupied, and such was the service even with just 2 tables occupied. VALUE FOR MONEY- It is not too costly but then why would one go here when the food and service both were a let down. Not coming again. Much much improvement needed.",Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Amrita Kaur,"Rated Located on the outer circle just opposite Lord of the drinks , me & my girls had planned to go somewhere else but we accidentally ended up here & I would like to say it turned out to be good accident . This place doesn't seem to be so spacious and smartly organised from outside but when you enter there is a surprise for you . Beautiful & vibrant interiors and amazing ambience especially the terrace Area. Divided into two sections both very appealing . A separate area for for a party ( if you want a private area this is a good option for you ). The staff is friendly and helpful. Now coming to the food we went there while there was a Sangria festival going on so we took sangria , beer and a shake . We wanted bira White which was out of stock , so we took bira Blonde . We stayed safe & ordered garlic bread , chill potato wedges & white sauce pasta . All three very nicely presented and delicious . The garlic bread was accompanied by a self made salsa sauce that I loved. They first served garlic bread which they thought was less in quantity , so they themselves served us another round of garlic bread which t was better in quantity ( it indeed was ) . Overall i loved the place & I would definitely visit here again to try new dishes . Yeeah yeaah to this one",Rated 4.0,39,353,??
Udit Batra,"Rated I don't really know what kinbuck 2 means and have slightly lost the curiosity to find out. The name says Kinbuck 2 a roman bistro, but what is so Roman about the place I fail to figure out. Maybe the brick wall interior and those lights what they may call roman, sorry I'm not amused. What does f^*k in hindi have to do with a roman bistro's decor? Their bar is tucked on the corner which is another thing I don't like because I'd only go to the bar myself and take that stool if it's located in the middle and not search for a hideout kind of thing in the corners. The service I would say is very well managed and the servers are helpful with the menu and ordering, probably the rating is only for the good service. Coming to food and drinks We ordered a sheesha that was made fine and the servers did change the coal from time to time. The chilli chicken dry was hopeless and can be easily avoided. All this and a couple of drinks cost us dear at 2100/-. A Sunday evening and an empty restaurant at one one of the primest locations of the city tells a story doesn't it?",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Kuljyoti Dhingra,"Rated Finally got to visit this place. Captivating ambience, marvellous food and beautiful decor compelled me to have a meal at this place. I absolutely loved it. Ordered mixed sauce pasta , vegetarian pizza (I don't remember the name though) , toum and orange mojito. * mixed sauce pasta - first bite of the pasta seemed quite weird to me due to some pungent taste but after few bites I felt in love with it. Pasta was reamy and luscious with perfect concoction of white sauce and red sauce garnished with basil and cheery tomato. * vegetarian pizza - thin crust was perfectly cooked and was damn tasty. Though taste was not anything extraordinary but it was definitely yummy. * toum - toum is basically a middle eastern garlic based dip which has distinct garlicky and sour flavour. It was served along pita bread and was definitely pleasant in taste. But if you are someone who hate garlic or could not stand pungent garlic flavour don't go for this dip since it leaves garlic odour in your mouth . * orange mojito - fresh, zingy and zesty it was extremely enticing. Loved It to the core. Food- 4/5 Ambience -5/5 Service- 3.5/5 Value for money - 4/5 Food was terrific and because of this I will certainly visit this place again",Rated 4.0,47,350,??
Divya Goel,"Rated Was waiting from a long time after reading this outlet's reviews, and finally got a chance to visit it. Ambience wise it was good, and i really liked the elongated space rather than the regular square cafes. The terrace area was really nice and the space division was good and considerable for a party. As for the food, we ordered honey chilli potatoes which was good but the chimichanga was a serious let down with undercooked dough. The veg platter was good. A little improvement in food is seriously recommended. Else a good place to hangout.",Rated 3.5,23,83,??
Shivendra Goel,"Rated Finally visted Kinbuck 2 also known as K2 situated in P Block Outer circle, Connaught Place. Ambience Locating this restro lounge was a difficult task owning to it's location in outer circle. But the moment you walk up the staircase, the place turns into a really different zone all together. Huge graffiti's and wall paintings all around, high seating chairs and a really dim lighting. We took a seat on it's really famous terrace which is very well curated considering the space constraints. K-2 property is lacking width and is very long lengthwise, which gave us a really different but good vibes unlike the other monotonous terrace properties in Inner circle etc. Food & Beverages We ordered a couple of rounds of kingfisher ultra beers which were priced pretty reasonably under their afternoon/happy hours menu. In snacks we ordered 1) Chilly Chicken Very well made, great portion size and amazing flavours. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 2) Vegetables Salt & Pepper Again the taste was really good and portion size was good. Lacked a bit of salt but overall the dish was decent. 3) Cottage Cheese Quesadilla 10/10 for presentation of this particular dish. But taste was not that great. The quesadilla seemed uncooked from certain sides. Dips served along with it were good. Hookah We heard that they serve really good hookah's but wasn't so that day. Thrice we had to ask the server to change the flavour since there was hardly any smell or taste. Ambience- 3/5 Food & Beverages- 4/5 Service- 4/5 Value for money-3.5-5 Overall Experience- 3.5/5",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Sharanya Singh,"Rated It is a fairly good place to chill with your gang with drinks and good food. The place has been done up well. We ordered Chicken steak, which was although slightly bland had a good serving. We really liked Beijing Chicken among the starters. It was a unique item on the menu and the peanuts imparted a distinct taste to it. Overall pretty decent place without being too heavy on the pocket.",Rated 3.5,8,63,??
Himanshu,Rated Went this place yesterday with office colleagues the place is good and ambience is nice but there is lack music because the music isn't that much loud to dance they should increase music volume quality..

Shikha,"Rated Kinbuck 2 is as nutty as fruitcake located in P block Cp near to Shivaji stadium. The place has Indoor, Outdoor & semi open sitting bustling with good colors , interiors & decors.

Ajay Singh,"Rated Well one of the newer additions to the never ending list of Restaurant and bars in connaught place. We Visited this place for a quick drinks session. The location is good, the seating and ambiance is good. We ordered a bucket of Hoegarden and got a free snack with it. The service was nice, and the music was just about ok.

Suhael Buttan,"Rated Recently visited kinbuck 2 on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty packed though there were hardly any people on the terrace. With right mix of songs and soothing environment, ambience was quite nice. I ordered crispy chicken bites , chicken quesadilla and k2 spice mix sangria. The chicken bites were crisp but I felt the chicken was undercooked as the pieces were quite hard. Also, they need to improve the dip they serve with it. Something more on the lines of a southwest dip would be nice because with the Mayo, it tasted quite bland. The chicken quesadilla was nice with decent filling but it lacked cheese. There was hardly any cheese but still it tasted pretty decent. The wine was the only saving grace. Alcohol rates are quite cheap and they also have sangria festival going on with excellent offers so if one is in the neighbourhood he/she can surely visit this place purely on the lines of reasonably priced alcohol.",Rated 3.0,29,128,??

Theophilus,"Rated The restaurant rooftop was a disappointment as the terrace was surrounded by 20 ft wall. It didn't have an open air feeling. The food was fine, cocktails didn't have a kick. The staff were nice however once it was nearing closing time, the staff couldn't wait for us to finish. They hurriedly cleared the food on the table, nearly snatched the drinks from our hands. The 15% discount for prior reservation is a scam.",Rated 3.0,32,258,??

Service is also good. Staff is very courteous. Only set back was 'Food'. We had #Mezze platter- four kind of snacks with 3 dips (egg plant, hummus, & mayonesse) along with two kind of salads.

Nishant Gupta,"Rated Bad bad experience. Went there last night n the place was totally thanda! We ordered whiskey sour, glen n nachos. WS was ok. Nachos were bad! It was supposed to be with cheese, they served it with cream sauce. Asked them to change it, they added a few drops of cheese n served the same thing again. N not to mention it is very expensive, esp given the quality of food. Not going there ever again. Even if it's for free.",Rated 1.5,14,76,??
Hiren Sharma,"Rated I along with 7 friends of mine chose this place for celebrating our Friday Eve ;) This place is located on the Outer Circle, right after the Kharag Singh Marg so locating the venue was not a problem for us. They have lounge sitting on First Floor and Second Floor has got some mixed flavors: Open sitting with tall walls all around and no roof (probably the best place to be in), Balcony View though the view from there is not much to talk about and third is the closed chamber (prefer not to sit unless u feel really cold). Coming over to the food, we ordered mainly vegetarian food. We order Veg Platter, Honey Chilli Potato, Soya Naaz a Ruhania, Nachos in the starters along with some Beer and Sangria. Sangria had usual taste, nothing over and above to call it a festival. I've had better flavors before. But don't be dissapointed, because the real love story started after the round of Sangria. Honey Chilli potato were fried to the crisp with sesame on top, honey and chilli were balanced well, overall pretty good. Soya Naaz a Ruhania were 4 whole peiced of tender tandoori chaamp, very well marinated, perfect blend of spices, had great taste all the way to its core (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED). Veg Platter was ordered to give a good glimpse of their overall taste. We had Paneer Tikka which was soft and flavourful, soft and sweet Dahi Ke Kabab (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AGAIN!!), Mushrooms (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AGAIN), Hara Bhara Kabab. We ordered Dal makhni, Kadai Paneer with Paneer Kulcha. After having it I realized, Paneer is surely their speciality, they got all the flavours right sarting from paneer tikka to Paneer Kulcha. Personally, I'm not a big fan of Paneer Kulcha but this was very different from what I usually had. Overall, A good place to chill out with Friends, Good Taste and Quality is really good, Sufficient Quantity and I had no complains regarding it. The only reason I am giving 4 star is because of the staff. Their behavior was somehow not right, seemed pretty uninterested even while taking our order. They were taking 10-15 minutes to bring our beer. And ya, they play old Jlo, David Guetta and Gangnam Style songs (hope they improve ;) I wish they improve on the service end and I'd be ready to give them 5 stars for sure.",Rated 4.0,46,311,??

Sweety Mittal,Rated Had heard a lot about this place so one fine day we went there....But the experience was a bit lukewarm. To my dismay they said only Chinese and Indian was available and in that too tofu was not available. It's a big place with good decor... The veg platter was good and so was the Hakka noodles.

There is a nice outside sitting space upstairs and it is almost always filled, but you can wait to get a seat there to enjoy the chilly weather during winters.

Long island iced tea was also not up to the standard . As starter we ordered dahi ke kabab and French fries which were fine.

After not getting a table at chosen pub we decided to try this out with a fear that how it would be but our apprehensions were put to rest by warm welcome & a cozy place to sit on terrace. It offers variety of dishes and we tried everything starting from prawns to peri peri chicken to chicken spring rolls to others. All the dishes served were hot & cooked optimally. Since we also had an expecting mom they ensured she's comfortable in sitting with no smokers around. Overall it was nice visit.Deepika Vivek Sharma,Rated 4.5,45,245,??

Apurv Kansal,"Rated Walking out of a client's office in CP, i was looking around to get some food as I skipped my lunch and I see this nice little rooftop right in front of me. Being a sucker for open space and rooftops, i simply walked into this place. The stairways lead me to a place full of young enthusiastic college goers probably celebrating someones birthday and as the staff kept asking me where would i like to sit, I just kept walking upwards encountering more such groups and finally came onto the balcony ledge I saw from down below. The place gives you a view of CP which is very different which you see from ground level. Having a great ambience both indoors and outdoors, and a friendly non obtrusive staff this place gives you a huge choice on its menu. I ordered a Veg Lasagne and as it came I kept looking at it cuz it was looking so beautiful and pretty. The aroma was great. (The server forgot to warn me that the plate would be hot which everyone does whenever serving Lasagne :) I dint burn my fingers though. As i started to dig into it, it was layers and layers of good cheese, white sauce, mix of veggies and lasagne sheets. It tasted good and wholesome but the Chef seemed to be a little very generous with black pepper. Over all the place is great if you just wanna sit on the ledge with a beer, taking in the view of CP or have a blast with a gang of friends. Do try it before you have to wait for another year to get the weather right !!!! PS. Anyone any clue why they call it Kinbuck 2 ??",Rated 3.5,50,2722,??

The place is akin to as perception builds out of the previously posted image :p, a lame purview, however the images are taken to give an extra edge to the place.( may be the table i got , not gave me an expected view of the ambiance). Anyways, the food and drink was satisfactory, Linguine Alla Partenopea pasta was quite good and the veggies should not prefer to visit the place as items are very less and thus limits their option. If you want to manage with Potato Wedges, the other way around, then its ok. Mojito tasted little different from regular mojitos , so not a good experience with it.

The outdoor seating is sprawled across a vertical space with an indoor seating between the 2 outdoor ones. The food is normal. We started with a white sauce chicken pasta, which we couldn't find in the menu. And mojito's. Everything tasted fine, neither too good nor too bad. We were still hungry and decided to order a pizza, which again was a tough find in the menu. They don't serve a variety of pizzas, the one which looked good was not available. We asked our server, but he too was clueless about them. Finally settled in for a Margherita and asked for it to be made with chicken as it was not mentioned in the menu.

The first thing that impressed me was the cellar kind of shelf at the entrance which gave it a traditional touch. The rooftop view was eye shimmering. Red wine was quite fine and so were the other drinks. My only disappointment was with the hukka. We ordered a large one and most of the time it was not working properly and so the staff kept on lighting it but that kept us idle for long periods which was mood shattering.

We had Cheese Chicken Malai Tikka and Chicken Chimmi Changa for starters, and Noodles with a Chinese preparation for Main Course. All of these were well delicious. For a food joint, food quality must be the top priority, and that is something they've definitely got right. The price line isn't really what Zomato indicates (it'll cost you more), but it's totally worth it. As for the down sides - there's aren't any as such. Singapore and Thai noodles were not available even through they were on the menu. Plus, they told us terrace seating hadn't launched yet even though it seemed otherwise, which I found to be slightly odd. Service was good, staff was very responsive, which is a great plus, but it would be nice to have someone greet you as you exit. Music and ambience were great too.

Sushriit Chatterjee,"Rated Kinbuck 2 13 Nov 2015 An unplanned lunch can be a delightful treat when you have a good company. Lately, I went for the same at P-10/90, 1st & 2nd floor, outer circle, Connaught Place, New Delhi. They call it Kinbuck 2. Divided in two floors we although were in the first one. It was Easy to grab seat, as there was hardly anyone. I had a second thought but too lazy to go from there. So we decided to stick there and have lunch. As usual I get hungry as soon as I enter the restaurants or lounges. Well, to start with, we ordered, crispy classic fish fingers which was served with fries and tartar dip. I somehow didnt like it much as the flavour of fish was somewhere subdued due to the deep fry thing perhaps. For the main course we ordered Chicken Roulade and chicken Steak. Let me tell something about the Roulade, its a dish of filled rolled meat or pastry. Traditionally, found in various European cuisines, is actually a French term. The chicken roulade was stuffed with spinach, roasted bell peppers and mozzarella served with grain mustard sauce and pesto potatoes. On the other hand chicken steak was grilled to the perfection and was accompanied with mushroom demi glaze and with whipped mash and veggies. To complement the food we ordered long island iced tea. It was very refreshing. It was a blend of vodka, rum, gin, tequila, triple sec and coke. The service was fine. Overall a good experience and would like to go there again. It is easy on pocket as well.",Rated 4.0,22,1493,??

We ordered a lot of stuff so dont remember the names of stuff individually. The sheesha was great too. Moreover and most importantly, I was greatly overwhelmed to see the photographer at the place.

Raina,"Rated Right on the opposite side of Lord of the Drinks, this place seemed interesting and we gave it a shot on Halloween's . Keeping up with the theme. the servers were all dressed accordingly and interiors were decorated with masks and creepy crawlies. This pub boasts of spaced out couches on the first floor and a beautiful rooftop one step above. The lighting was perfect and tables were candlelit, which again was a plus. We ordered couple of drinks along with Meat Sambousek and Nachos , both of which were impressive , more importantly the former. Meat Sambousek is a new find , which had small samosa like wraps, stuffed with minced lamb. Absolutely a delight to have with the beer. The nachos was also decent with the accompanying dips. The drinks are moderately priced ( at par with cp pubs of the standard ) if you consider the happy hour menu, but can be expensive otherwise. The AC was a bit too strong with respect to Delhi November. The servers are friendly and take all your requests with full on energy . Have to try their rooftop next time !",Rated 4.0,43,339,??

Pasta and pizza was really amazing, tandoori platter is something to go for, chaaps and tikkas are spicy so they taste even better. The shakes are also pretty decent.

Neerpriya Bakshi,"Rated I wanted to celebrate my birthday at a nice rooftop place and hence after much scrutiny i came down to kinbuck2. I wanted to throw a party for around 18 people and booked the balcony that they have. The place had a very personalized and private feel to it and since i had chosen to go with a la carte, they had assigned a person to take care of the whole party for me. The balcony had a brilliant view of cp and looked beautiful with fairy lights. Another plus point was that the place was running some heavy discounts on drinks because of oktobeerfest because of which i got great beer like Corona,Budweiser for cheap prices. The only set back that i felt was that their service was very slow. Had to wait for long time intervals for food to come. On the whole my bill came to around 15000 for 18 people which on the whole was decent. I would recommend this place for a nice gathering because of its private party space.

Parikshit Singh,Rated Kind of mixed feelings for this place good interiors but not much of a exciting vibe been here two times and both the times left soon. May be because both the times it was a weekday. Exciting food menu but to be very frank protion sizes is an issue I found and also the food itselves no so good at taste. Nice interiors though got both options to sit upstairs where smoking is allowed and downstairs. I liked the upstairs place better.,Rated 3.0,12,69,??
Ambika Mathur,"Rated I had very low expectations when i first heard of this place as one always does one you hear of a place that serves indian, chinese as well as italian but boy was i proved wrong! They've done up the restaurant beautifully with wooden flooring, chandeliers and a beautiful arrangement for sitting on the rooftop where they have pretty lanterns in which they put candles and basically make it the perfect place for winter. After the ambience having blown me away we ordered our drinks which we found to be relatively cheap. (350 bucks for an liit. Go happy hours!) The drinks were well made. to eat we ordered the cheese nachos, the non vegetarian platter which was basically a variety of chicken kababs and tikkas, a club sandwich and a plate of malai tikkas. Had no complaint with ANY of the food items. Reasonably priced and pretty delicious. Although they could maybe work on their presentation a bit but the delicious food and the ambience make up for it. Found this place to be of great value for money for the promt service and cheap tasty food that they were providing.

Ankur Jindal,"Rated Oh my god! Was I blown away or what! We were looking to visit someplace else but due to rush we opted for it. The ladies were hungry and ordered soup for themselves before anything else. When everyone tasted theirs, a fear gripped me that I had taken the wrong decision to try out a new place, but how I was proven wrong. You're likely to miss it during driving as most other places are on the other side of outer circle. They have seating at 2 levels. The lounge is nice and comfortable. The terrace is the place to be especially in good weather. There's seating in the foyer too, overlooking the splendid views CP has to offer. Our order 1) Soups - Disaster. The sweet corn didn't have anything sweet and the manchow was a poor cousin of the sweet corn. Please avoid. 2) Veggie kebab platter - The mushrooms had a tinge of mustard oil which gave it a bit of a kick. The other items I didn't taste but the table had good reviews. Recommended 3) Chimi Changa veg - Different preparation than you'll find at authentic Mexican joints. But tasty nevertheless. Even my 3 year old relished it. 4) Cottage Cheese steak - All the food looked good but this deserves special mention. The ratatouille on top of the mashed potatoes was delicious. Great dish again. Lots of flavours 5) Soya naaz e ruhania tikka - Soft, succulent and again with the mustard kick. Recommended. 6) Dal makhni - I'm not dal makhni fan but again I was surprised. Great taste. 7) Malai kofta - I like my kofta gravy a little sweet. This wasn't. 8) Breads (Kulcha/Naan/Lachha Parantha) - I don't remember having better breads anywhere else I've been to. Soft and almost melt in your mouth. Zaranj in Calcutta comes to mind for comparable quality. 9) Mojito - Special shout out to the bartender for this. Absolutely refreshing. The right proportion of all ingredients served in a jar. The service was good. We had a great dinner and great evening at a great place.",Rated 4.5,74,94,??
Ritesh Thusu,"Rated So we were a gang of 7 and landed here in a Saturday evening. Kinbuck2. The name is what allured me. Nice spinoff. Diagonally opposite Lord of the Drinks, Kinbuck2 has a valet parking available, which is a huge relief. The held our reservation and made sure we get a decent table. They have a bit of a space constraint but the ambience is well done enough to hold back the guests. The drinks menu was a delight and the prices were almost as cheap as it could get. Our whole bill was diverted towards the drinks. The food was also quite nice. Crispy Chicken Bites were nicely done and went well with the sauce. Veg Chimi Changas were a bit of a disappointment though. Another Chicken dish we ordered with Fries was spicy enough for our liking. The let downs were space constraints and the DJ, who was a huge disappointment. The songs were way to long and were too repetitive. The DJ took long breaks and played quite lame music. A big turn off. Having said that this place is definitely worth a visit. Just for the booze though. Cheers!!",Rated 3.0,52,215,??
Manik Sidana,"Rated First things first... If u wanna go here for Oktoberfest and enjoy beer, STOP right here... The advt on their zomato page is completely misleading. It says beer@89... But you only get KF pint for 89. All other pints like budweiser etc are arnd 160-180. So don't get misleaded... Now to the food... Well ! It's decent but could be made better... For example, the nachos get served without any toppings or cheese. You just get two dips. No fun.... The ambience.. Full marks.. U have nice options to take a seat indoor, outdoor and a fusion of both. Overall, its a nice place just for the experience. If you're looking for great food and drinks, go somewhere else.

Gautam,"Rated Went there with my friends. Kinbuck 2 has an awesome liquor collection, not to mention, good western cuisine. Food isn't upto the mark with most dishes being quite mediocre. Ambience is very pleasing. Lounges are very comfortable, especially the sofas. However, it is very cramped. Service was one of the best I have seen and very professional. Orders were fulfilled at a very fast clip despite being quite crowded on a Saturday. Price is decent for both food and liquor but higher than many other clubs around. Hookah at an affordable price is an added bonus. Music is quite good, with DJ playing most of the requested play lists. Overall, an excellent place to hangout with friends.",Rated 4.0,32,83,??
Hungry Khan,"Rated I went here with some new people, midweek and thus was hesitant to blatantly take pictures. As a result I do not have any of my usual array of pictures to share with you dear reader. But I do hope you will bear with me as I share my experience. The ambience was quite dim and loungey. The music was regular 2014-15 wala house party playlist (calvin harris, pink etc). The servers were quick though they didn't serve us water and we had to specifically ask, even though we were a huge group. The guy who took our order seemed to be having a bad day as he forgot to bring some of the items we ordered and also took a long time to give us basic condiments and sauces. Coming to the food, it was simply alright. The portion sizes are huge. The jalapeno poppers and fries were served first with some really good dips which we used to fill ourselves up. There was a creamy cheese lasagna which was super rich but needed to be spruced up with spices as it was a bit too bland. The chicken pizza was good in my opinion with a fair amount of cheese and chicken. The mutton lasagne served with garlic bread was by far the best dish. We also ordered the veg bruschetta which was nice and crunchy. What I didn't like was the Changa wrap (paneer). The rogan josh was good and quite spicy. Another dish which I really liked was the chicken roullade (am I spelling that right?) which was quite delicious! We didn't have any space left for dessert but around 9 people ate quite for about 5,000 bucks which in my opinion is quite reasonable. I didn't like the ambience and quality of service, but that is a pain point across all restaurants in connaught place and I honestly didn't have very high expectations. I might go back and check out their terrace and have lunch there on a cold wintry morning.",Rated 3.5,75,847,??
Shefali Rattan,"Rated Visited this cafe yesterday for a late lunch. Like every other restaurant opening in the area, it is little dark with good music in terms of ambience. Since it was a weekend, only space available was in outdoor area. The sitting arrangements are quite nice for this one with coolers with water sprays kept for the hot weather. Service was quick except the Lebanese platter. We ordered one kingfisher one ginger mojito in drinks alongside apple walnut cheese salad which had lots of leafy veggies and was quite yummy. Along with this was this Turkish Gairo platter which had 4 rolls, 2 each of chicken and lamb and the one with shawarma like filling was quite nice. 4 different kinds of dips were served alongside which included hummus, mayonnaise, eggplant puree etc. The menu is quite interesting and you would need multiple visits to taste the complete menu and judge. This one can definitely be tried once.",Rated 3.5,65,265,??
Finger & Fork,Rated Visited Kinbuck 2 for a lunch date with my girlfriends. We ordered bira blonde and a sex on the beach. The cocktail was just about OK.

We ordered the beer combo and a sheesha. The waiter was really courteous and very helpful but service was a bit slow maybe becoz less no of servers on top floor.

The Intrepid Eater,"Rated Kinbuck2 felt schizophrenic and left us confused too. It came up on a search of Romanian restaurants in Delhi and we went for the promise of Romanian food. We should have been wary of a place also serving Mexican, Moroccan, Middle Eastern, Italian, Chinese, Indian and who knows how many other cuisines. I'm not sure it's possible to do so much and be able to do any of it well, unless you have an army of highly trained and specialized staff. Perhaps their strategy was to have so diverse a menu that you're going to find whatever you might like to eat on it. But then, how likely is the food to deliver on taste? Well, it seems that at some point they changed from a Romanian to a Roman restaurant. The first two pages of their menu does list Romanian dishes, but the restaurant, and the waiter who served us, claimed these were roman dishes and seeing our confusion, very helpfully added that Rome was in Italy. A Romanian friend of mine who had the very dissonant experience of sitting through all this suggested we try a couple of items from the Romanian page before ordering a full meal, since at this point we were very doubtful of the offerings. Since the very existence of Romania as a place where food might come from had been firmly denied in the front of the house, it was extremely unlikely that the person cooking had any more experience with the cuisine. We tried two soups- The Bors de Urechiuse and Ciorb de Perisoare. There was no sign of Bors or mushrooms, and the meatballs weren't tender. Taste was fine (hence the 2.5) but we decided to continue our meal somewhere (anywhere) else.",Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Comfortable., cozy seating with good loud music is the place. Assets: to start with i would really appreciate the staff for their patience involvement in attending the guests. Food was awesome. Me being veg i had mushroom ravioli contadino.. Mushroom ravoli with tomato and basil sauce. Sauce was neither too tangy or too spicy but properly flavoured. My friends along being non veg eaters hogged onto their special roman dish of lamb which was served with salad , chicken alfredo pasta and rice served with white sauce and chicken.(forgot their names) all decently plated and deliciously served. They also serve good range of beverages and hookah. Disappointments: Nothing big disappointed us.

The staff was a little slow but the manager/ owner was courteous and hopitable.. It has couple tables on one side on the lower floor and sofas for groups on the other side!!

I really like the ambiance; as far as I know it's rush hour is the evening time so it was another experience to visit it during lunch hours. The Menu is very wide with all international cuisines and even the bar menu has a lot of options. What we had: For Starters we had Garlic Bread with Cheese (the Mozzerella cheese delight) For beverages: Octobeer special Budweiser Magnum and Dark Chocolate Shakes. For Main Course: Lasagne and Quesadilla. The Italian cuisine was a delight; I had tasted the lasagne dish plenty of times but this was the best I ever had.

Tapan Tyagi,"Rated Kinbuck 2s service is similar to the service provide by MTNL in late 90s, NON - EXISTENT Here's the sequence of events: Three main course dishes were ordered and the server was told to bring them together, Dish 1 came after 40 minutes , Dish 2 came after another 20 minutes and Dish 3 never made it to the table, when asked the servers had no answer at all and thus started the blame game, eventually we had to ask them to cancel the 3rd dish (if at all they had started making it), and to our surprise the servers never uttered a word regarding the cancellation and happily obliged with the it. Sorry was just not a part of their vocab so no complaints there, after all the conversation regarding the lack of service ,they even had the audacity to give us a feedback form with the bill talk about timing!!!..

Natasha Ahuja,Rated Visited Kinbuck2 a couple of months back but the review has been pending for quite some time. The place is located at the outer circle. It also has a small terrace and has good view. Tried the chicken steak it was served in vegetables but did not like the steak at all. The chicken was so hard and became impossible for me to eat. Then we had the chicken scalppino which was another disappointment. Then we had Falafel E diaz tahine this was basically a sort of Mezze Platter. The falafel were basically kebabs served with humus and pita bread were really good in taste. We tried the Tochitur from the roman section. It was chicken gravy with rice. A complimentary glass of wine was served alongwith this. This was good in taste. Last we ordered Fish Fingers. Good crispy golden fried fish served with mayonaise was good.

Anushka,"Rated Went to Kinbuck 2 the other day; and ordered a Chimi Changa Veg. Which is basically a type of a mexican spring roll served with salsa and sour cream. Extremely tasty and amazing. Loved the presentation. Loved the taste. I had quite some high expectations from this place as soon as we entered, we were the only people sitting. The lighting is dim, giving it a lounge kinda look. And also, the place is quite far from the metro station which is an another drawback. All in all, there's nothing really THAT amazing that would make you visit that place a second time. Also ordered a Chilly Paneer with Singaporean Chowmein. The chilly paneer was delicious, didn't really like the chowmein. Think twice before ordering a new dish here.",Rated 3.0,23,56,??
Yashasvini Kumar,"Rated I want to start this review by pointing out that Zomato gives this place a 3.9 rating.LOOKS LIKENext to the Saravana Bhawan on CPs outer circle , the bones of this old building are pretty exciting. The ceiling goes from about 30 feet to 7 in places, with the right interior decorator this place could have been really interesting. But without any windows or original thought the place is pretty but dingy. The cavernous interiors are probably better suited for a club.TASTES LIKEI dragged an old friend to Kinbuck 2 because Zomato said it was the only restaurant in Delhi serving Romanian food. My friends will tell you that this kind of bizarre is right up my alley.The Romanian section of the menu is elaborate but the descriptions arent particularly clarifying. The waiters got antsy when I insisted I wanted to order something Romanian, beseeching us to stick to the Chilli Paneer. Not easily discourageD, I ordered the Frigui (what the menu describes as Romanian kebabs) and the Tequila Lime Shrimp.Im not sure why the waiters were so worried. The Frigui tastes like kebabs. My only issue was that it was served cold but otherwise just like any plain old kebabs youd get on any street corner in Delhi. The Tequila Lime Shrimp was also cold and could have used some more lime but came with an elaborate bread basket. I dropped the shrimp and dove into the cart of carbs instead.Tired of my experiments my friend gave up and ordered the much vaunted Chilli Paneer. Its the Chilli Paneer you get in every dive bar in Delhi.Fed up, my companion turned to his LIIT for comfort and didnt find it. The menu also has North Indian, Italian, Mexican, Chettinad, Chinese and Lebanese food but my friend was looking close to tears so we bounced out.FEELS LIKEThe staff was unable to help us decipher the Romanian menu and the service was slow.All in all, Kinbuck 2 is mundane and uninspiring. Saravana next door has better food and Monkey Bar around the corner better cocktails. reluctantchef.in",Rated 2.5,59,316,??

We ordered a beer bucket with 12 bottles, a plate of French fries with chilli garlic dip and chilli chicken. Food was great! The best part was the dip which was mind blowing, so much so we ended up asking for extra. The chilli chicken was made really well too. We made a bill of 3000, but it was worth the experience.

Now coming to the food, we ordered chilli chicken (dry), malai chicken tikka, chicken nuggets, chilli mushroom, chilli paneer and paneer tikkas for starters and I absolutely loved their chicken nuggets! Then there was pasta (veg and non-veg) which was good too. I think for drinks, their orange virgin mojito is very refreshing and has the right amount of tanginess. The only thing I didn't like was the chicken steak which was a little too spicy and was not well done.

Ravi Mittal,"Rated Chanced upon this place while surfing through places to dine at Connaught Place and it was rather highly rated, so we decided to pay a visit. Touted as a Romanian restaurant, it sparked our interest by evoking thoughts of Roman Grandeur in it's interiors, which we hoped for. Located on the first floor along P block of C.P, the entrance was rather uninspiring. Once inside we took a table and looked around us only to find brick wall interiors and a few images and captions on the wall. Disappointed by the lack of grandiose we went on to order some beers only to discover they were facing a supply issue and had limited options available. We stuck to K.F premium while going through the unfathomably large and unending menu card. It reminded me of Gordon Ramseys Kitchen Nightmares, where one of his key lessons always is to have a small menu and gain mastery over it. We however had options ranging from Romanian, Arabic, North Indian, Asian and Continental in a menu spanning a dozen pages atleast. Post lot of debate for about 15 minutes we managed to choose the Fried Kibbeh and a crispy chicken bites with fries and chilli mayo. Sadly, the food didnt live up to the expectation and it was no surprise either. It is silly of the management to expect a small team in the kitchen to cook up hundreds of dishes across 4-5 cuisines and do it well. The music was EDM and the giant screen was playing random cricket matches from the past. They refused to switch to live football even upon request. The hookah though was good, and they do have plenty of options for the same. But going by the ambiance, service, music and food, it is a highly over rated place id say. We didnt stick around for dinner either, moved to a much better restaurant nearby..",Rated 3.0,279,905,??

We ordered: Food- 5/5 Everything right from the drink to each food item that we ordered was cooked with perfection. Only the quantity of the dips or chutneys or raita or sauce was lesser compared to the main item. Guacamole with Nachos- guacamole and salsa was good. Nachos were crispy. The only drawback was the quantity of guacamole n salsa given. Had to think and eat. We didnt ask for a refill- or we should have. Penne All Arrabiata- was good, full of flavors and colors. Penne was cooked to perfection. Chicken Biryani- was cooked to perfection, full of flavors and aroma. Raita was good. Pappads were crispy. Tandoori Chicken Tikka- was the show stealer !! Succulent and full of flavors, well-marinated. K2- mocktail- was refreshing and different (a friend ordered and its her inputs). Dark Chocolate shake- was good, and not at at all heavy to drink. kitkat shake (without banana) - was pretty much like the dark chocolate shake cos this friend didnt want the banana part added. Virgin mojito- was good n refreshing. Service- 5/5 Was little slow since it was the non-peak hours but no complaints.. as we too wanted to laze around and sit and talk. ambience - 4/5 A bit cramped and narrow. We went at the non peak hour so it was almost empty with only few couch-tables full. Music was lively and has a projector screen. We sat right under the projector screen.

For foodies like us the ambience, staff and the food plays equal role to make a good experience worth it. This place did not do justice to any of the three.. The interiors and decor were regular similar to other lounges in CP. The service was decent. We tried tandoori mushrooms, pasta arabiatta, make your own sandwich in vegetarian and chicken tikka and prawns in non-veg. The portion was apt but presentation was regular and the taste was not up to the mark. The mushrooms was the only decent dish. and mojitos being extremely sweet. Located in CP which indeed is a hub for the foodies, this place desperately needs to work on their food.. I assume they believe in variety but variety should be complemented enough with the taste.

Neelaakshi Piplani,"Rated On Tuesday, 18th August late evening I visited Kinbuck 2 at a friends birthday party. Located in P Block outer circle second floor (nearest metro station Rajiv Chowk gate no 7) Connaught Place, my expectations were quiet high from this outlet. As soon as I reached there, the entrance was done brilliantly and it felt WOW. We were the only people there and we were sitting right beside the bar. There were two sections on this floor, one adjacent to the bar had comfy furniture, dim lighting giving it a lounge kinda look and the section behind had chairs and appropriate lights making it attractive for dining kinda people. Ambience was definitely a win-win and though they offer multiple cuisines- Chinese, Indian, Italian, continental, Japanese, Lebanese but the quality of food was a big big disappointment. The liquor, hookah and service was average. Food- 1. Pasta arabiatta- Bland pasta stirred with red sauce and broccoli. The garlic bread was a decent eat. 2. Tandoori Mushroom- the portion was apt and tasted average. 3. Chicken tikka- We literally had to struggle to eat the chicken as the pieces were too big for a single bite. We did order sandwiches and prawns which were just average dishes. The presentation was the usual, dishes accompanied with green chutney.. In today's time when almost all the joints are focussing on making an impact with their presentation, Kinbuck 2 doesn't feel the need to! They were having 1+1 offer on just beer.. We ordered Cosmopolitans, mojitos and Virgin mojito. The mojitos were served in a jam jar..it was not close to those perfect mojito..just okay types!! Coming to the service, the waiters appeared to feel irritated by our constant orders and specially when we were requesting a coal change for the hookah. We sat there around 5:45pm and thought the place had all the empty tables, One of the waiter asked us to vacate the table before 8:30pm, which was indeed rude. Our bill was for 7100INR after a 15% discount..Pretty expensive place considering the in hospitality of the staff there.

The low seating makes sure everyone can enjoy the ambiance and prevents the place from looking crowded. We sat on the couch near the bar and the view of the perfectly lit bar and the walls and chandeliers was very soothing. The use of old wine bottles to serve some light to customers added the right bit of character to the place. Food: We ordered Fattoush Salad and Linguine alla partenopea (Veg). The salad was fresh and perfectly juicy with a hint of extra olive oil. The pasta tasted perfect, with the sauce blending perfectly with sphaggeti. The taste was not new or characteristic. Service: Quick and attentive. Overall I found a good place and am going there again soon. Price: We had lunch of two for a total of 650 inclusive of taxes without alcohol. What more can one ask for.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Althoug i find the place is little small but once u sit and taste the food all negative points turns out to be the positive Now coming on to the food i odered the vegerable salt n pepper (4.5/5) then i odered the malai corn kebab (4/5) i find it very sweet becoz of corn so i left the dish, then i odered the vegetable noodles (10/5) super delicious ( must try ) One suggestion before coming plzz reserve ur table becoz this place is gonna b always full and in future it will be becoz of gr8 food and too gud ambience and if u hv to wait....its WORTH the waiting. Best waiter : INDER ask for him and tell him to serve u and he will add stars to ur night by gud srvice n good hospitality which he is very good at it.

The drinks were fine as usual but what disappointed me was the food menu and such uneven mix of veg and non veg starters. Our hearts were broken when we were told that the popular indian chakhna ""masala peanuts"" were not there. The ambience was decent and the DJs were trying hard to put their best foot forward.

We were a huge party so I am not going into what we ordered but out of everything that we did order, nothing was bad or bland.

Both these dishes were of good quality, well presented and sumptuously served. Their quantities are more than sufficient. The chicken was tender and very well seasoned. Beijing chicken is hands down a 5/5. The other one came in as a sizzler. Next we tried the chicken paprika burger and classic chicken hakka noodles. The burger was a 4/5. The noodles were delicious and even after having a considerable share of our food here, none of us felt heavy. Very fine cooking and quality. However, quite not the family restaurant i'd say.

Farozna Rehman,"Rated This place was chosen after much research but they got me at their name. Let's start with how nobody was there to open the gate for us. I don't mind opening gates for myself but they have a heavy one. The only flaw if you ask me was the staff was not very quick as we visited in daytime. The place was not crowded at all and so the servers weren't paying much attention to us as well. Anyways the ambience was good. They slayed the Interior game. I sat on the base floor because it was too hot for the rooftop. Food was good I wasn't expecting much in the taste section because I've been to lounges like these and they couldn't satisfy my taste buds so i went there without any expectations. We didn't eat much because the shakes they serve were enough to fill you up till your eyes. No kidding the shakes were served in huge bottles and i couldn't have asked for more but we ordered some starters anyways. The paneer tikka was like any other paneer tikka but the dahi kebabs, I can't explain how exotic they were. I've never thought something named dahi kebab could be this sophisticated. ***INSTANT FAVORITE*** It was a good visit all in all a bit heavy on the pocket but i totally understand because of the location and Interiors. I will definitely pay a visit again for the rooftop experience in the coming winters and enjoy those dahi kebabs all by myself. P.S. The music needs to get upgraded asap.",Rated 4.5,3,0,??

The terrace is beautiful. The menu is so big and the best part was that everything was available. Staff is gud. We started with a pan hukka and it was awsum. Had such a good sheesha in a long time. We ordered mutton galauti, grilled fish, onion capsicum pizza, veg chimichanga and a cottage cheese burger. Galauti was not a galauti. It was a simple mutton kebab patty only. Was very very disappointed. The staff should change its name though. The grilled fish was just ok. It should have been more tender as sole are meant to be. However full marks to all the veg dishes. Pizza , chimichanga and burger were tasty. After a while we ordered honey chilly potato and a chicken burger. In drinks my friends had a cosmopoliton and a coolcollin. All of these were great.

Alin Choubey,"Rated I saw the place decent on Zomato and went there. Called before and got a nice table for two. The manager Mr. Vijay was very cooperative on the call. When I went there it was as sold, Cozy, soothing and calm. But thats it, apart from ambience and courteous administration staff they are Hoax in every term.The music was totally opposite to ambience, the waiters very low on ear, the bartender will make fool out of you and so will chef. I ordered Scotch which doesn't give scope to screw but later ordered a Caipirosaka which was a disaster. The lemons were bitter which made the drink pathetic and on complaining the guy took drink and returned it by adding Sprite as if my taste buds are illiterate. Then the food, I ordered Nan and they served Tandori Roti saying this is Nan. I was in no mood to argue. The Paneer was taste less. Plain Gravy based nothing special. And worst of all we had to shout like on a dhaba to call waiter. Anyways I was on my best mood and so I didn't made a fuss. All this the place have is a decent ambience.

Rashi Joshi,"Rated Frankly I had not heard of this place till I happened to pleasantly discover it. It was a scorching Sunday afternoon..and we had to wait almost half an hour cause the place was full. Okay, I had no clue this place was this popular among people. After half an hour, the guy maintaining the list felt pity on us seeing us sweating and puppy eyed, he got us upstairs..so that we could atleast stand in the air conditioned place. The place had an aroma of lemon grass(which was way too strong), dark, good music, cosy chairs, and bunch of people who just blow you away with their hospitality. Okay, it's kinda like a lounge. Food is good, walls and roof have distinct features..they look both classy and idiosyncratic at the same time. It was a scorching afternoon, so even a mere thought of sitting on the alfresco terrace seating ran a chill down my spine. Drinks are decently priced. They had a combo offer where they were giving 3 Viru beers(Japanese they say, didn't hear of them before) plus starters for Rs. 999. We anyways went for drinks we had known. We ordered a lasagna, which was great. Followed by a pasta..which wasn't up to my expectations. But for the two of us, it was filling. The waiters are caring, in fact two managers who were super friendly and so concerned it touched my heart. The seating is good, the one next to the bar has so much less light, I actually had to use my phone's torch to read the menu. In a nutshell, my experience can be surmised as below: 1. Cool place to hang out with your friends or special friend. 2. Drinks decently priced 3. Hospitable..everyone came to ask how the lasagna and pasta was, like that's an issue of national interest ;) 4. Changed my seat thrice, cause I'm kinda like Sheldon in finding my spot. They accommodated our change with smiles. 5. Ambiance is good, the winter evenings in the terrace can lead to a romantic affair 6. Three beers, one cocktail(large), pasta and lasagna costed us around 2k which is decently priced as the food and the service was good. 7. They also serve Roman food, didn't try though as was too hungry to be experimenting cuisines. All in all, a good place!!",Rated 4.0,11,29,??

Madhulika Sharma,"Rated Going by the reviews, me and friends thought of trying this place. Ambience is good, pretty much like every other cafe you find in Delhi. I generally write positive reviews. But this time, its going to be critical. My Order: One of the Cocktail Pitcher of the summer special, Gaucamola Dip with Nachos and Basil and Jalapeo popers with dip. Later, we had to replace the second dish with Lotus Stem Honey chilly. Service: Exceptionally poor service. Took a lot of time to serve basic food which doesn't require any cooking. No nampkins on the table. It wasn't crowded also. Taste: First came the cocktail pitcher which was very refreshing after a long day, it had flavors of cranberry and orange . The Basil and cheese arrived after that. However, with a small ant in it. By the time we discovered it i had tasted it. It was Mc Cains cheese popers served with Jalapeos separately. The Nachos were cornitos Nachos from the packet. The Gaucamola dip was sour, not edible. The Honey chilly lotus stem was just okay. It tasted good, but the lotus stem was very sticky, may be because too much corn flour was used. After sometime we noticed HAIR on the plate and it wasn't an eye lash or a girls hair... it was clearly some male person's hair. That's visible in the photograph. Please have a look. Be careful when u eat anything. In all, the experience was bad and would not recommend or go back there myself. The food and alcohol is heavily priced.

VARUN AGGARWAL,"Rated Kinbuck 2 seems to be a strange rather funny name for a bistro-restaurant. This place in CP has pretty cool interiors unlike other regular places. Dim Lighting with chandeliers and brick walls, lounge seating adds on to the feel. 80s and 90s English music felt bit out of sync for a bistro, so did the amalgamation of several cuisines in the menu for a roman bistro. But located in CP it is basic essential for any place to succeed, it has to cater to all tastes and yes the Food was good too.. We had tried 1) Assorted mushroom in chilli oil (was a star, basic sauted sliced button and black mushrooms but done to perfection with good flavour of cheese and chilli). 2) A veg Chimi changa filled with paneer, jalapenos, cheese was good but bit too chewy, salsa was like ketchup with tomato pieces was bad, another dip I just couldnt make out what it was because it was so tasteless.. 3) Paneer steak with ratatouille had brilliant presentation, tasted great and was a big hearty portion. 4) Chicken biryani was good as well 5) Malai Kofta and Black Daal had all the right ingredients and presentation but somehow I found both lacking in taste and flavour. 6) Brownie was bit soggy and heavy for my palate. Service provided by Ravi was personal and top notch. Thanks Ravi. Half a rating point extra for its absolutely neat and clean good looking toilet (hard to find in CP restaurants) and clean kitchen with staff in proper cooking attire (I managed a peek though was not an open kitchen). Overall place seems to be great, worth a visit, standards should be maintained here. Good new places like these opening up in CP should make CP more happening again.

Siddhant Singh,"Rated Yeaah i went there today . It's a sort of roman cuisine restaurant but it seems more like a cafe except for the chandeliers . They serve good quality liquor but i wasn't happy with the food . I had ordered basic stuff . Just nachos , they were okay but then i had ordered pasta which was next to tasteless . The restaurant was not even half filled . I have heard it's good on the rooftop but i couldn't get there coz it was under maintenance . And the music at this place was terrible , they literally had just 4 -5 lame old songs and they were just repeating them over and over . But the positives were that this place has real potential to be one of the best restaurants in cp and that it really looks good even though it's not related to roman . I'll rate it 3/5.",Rated 3.0,24,179,??

When we entered, the ambience was wow but then i looked around and it seemed a cafe with limited space but then we are asked to come upstairs and it was a roof top and then again wow. We ordered some mocktails, shakes and veg platter, and to be honest I was not satisfied with the quality, quantity and the presentation of food and the taste was also not up to expectations.

Avinash Das,"Rated I went to this restaurant after seeing the review on Zomato and being recommended by a friend. First impression, the staff were really friendly and accomodative as me and my girlfriend wanted to sit at a particular place where the table was for 6 persons. The staff were also patiently recommended dishes, careful to explain the ingredients so we could take an informed decision. The lighting was just right though we would have preferred some soft music. We had three dishes. The Sangerete, offered in three variants, of which we had the pork, was flavored with fat and meat, and the Rubbian Mishwey, prawns coated with Lebanese herbs and served with orange mayonnaise, were really outstanding. In short Kinbuck 2 is a must try! Truly a romantic place.",Rated 4.0,3,0,??

Haven't tried the main course, but most of the starters we had were really nice. Though a bit on the expensive side, but I guess it's okay-ish according to a Connaught Place restaurant.

Paridhi Gupta,"Rated Kinbuck 2 is located in the outer circle of CP, just beside the outer circle Sarvana Bhawan (not the janpath one). It has various cuisines and does an extremely good job at them. The must have is the cumin jack Daniel BBQ chicken wings, they provide you with an instant foodgasm and leave you wanting more and more. If you like lasagna, it is a good choice as well, though I personally am not a fan of bland food. The quantity they provide us very fulfilling. If you prefer North Indian, order your malai koftas or some non veg curry with breads. Missi rotis and lachcha paranthas are cooked well, unlike most places. The place is though not so heavy on the pockets for a place like CP, but they do levy a heavy service charge beside the service tax. If you're going late at night, the place might be a bit too dim for you but its nevertheless a nice ambience. They play good music to accompany your delicious food, usually 90s English music.

Divya Chhabra,"Rated So thus turned out to be a random visit with friends on a Sunday late eve when we know how super crowded CP is. While we were struggling for parking and thinking that we might have to wait for long for our table (since we went without reservation), to our surprise it was quiet empty at such rush hours. We climbed 2 floors up to reach to this place named Kinbuck2 ( I like d name ?), and entered through a decently done up small passage. The decor was quiet decent nor too lavish neither to dull. We managed to get the very first sofa seats for 5 ppl. We ordered their mushroom tika, white sauce pasta, mushroom soup, kebab platter, oreo shake, kitkat shake and a few mock tails. And I will have to say the soup,food and shakes everything was really yummy (especially the kitkat shake).. at one point when I was too skeptical about this place and at the other point my mind was just changed after having tasted their food. To add on after a while dj started playing which added soo much to the ambience, beautiful sufi songs just made our evening even better. We quiet liked the staff service, management and quick response by them. Our bill in total turned out to be around 3300/-, not bad at all. Where cafe's like warehouse, white waters, etc are charging an amount more than this and delivering not so tasty food, I think Kinbuck2 is just on the right path.

On being inquired, the service staff politely accepted that they do serve hookah to kids irrespective of the age. This was shocking. In a telephonic conversation with the Secretary of the NRAI, I was informed that it is a violation of a legislation which prohibits selling hookah to a certain age group. But it is so disheartening that NRAI takes no legal action despite being informed about such violations, rather guide you to approach the court of law. No matter how beautifully a reastaurant is done, how much ever authentic international cuisine it promises to serve, If it fails to adhere to the basic laws, it is just NOT WORTH IT!!!

Shivam Gupta,Rated Hello Food Stalkers.. I would like to share my worthy experience for Kinbuck2 in Cannaught Place.. I went there for my birthday with my girl.. The place was worth going for the occasion.. I ordered one burger and mocktail randomly as I went there for the very first time.. The burger was so delicious and tasty.. The exact word I should say Mouth Watering Dishes they serve.. And mocktails in the menu were so eye catchy.. Not only eye catchy but yes they were worth it and so yummy.. My tummy was full but felt like I should have more and more.. The ambience was so nice and happening with some amazing music.. And now if I come to hospitality it was marvellous.. So sweet and cooperative they were.. In total I would rate them 4.5/5.. Guys.. My personal suggestion.. Must try cafe.. I have been to many cafes in CP..

Nikhil Aul,"Rated Right around the corner from Starbucks, walk up a narrow set of stairs to get to Kinbuck2. The place is spread more on its length than the breath where DJ is placed right next to the entrance. Comfortable atmosphere along the 1st floor but the place is better known for its rooftop where you can escape the heat under cool mists, coolers all around and a dimly lit red environment. Menu: Alcohol menu is extensive with variety of options available which are quite reasonable priced (to my surprise) Food menu much like the drinks menu is extensive (to the point it's confusing) Cuisines: Romanian, Indian, Chinese, Arabic and continental (quite a list eh!) However food is expensive here much in comparison to its alcohol Since I was with a company that doesn't like to eat a lot - I just ordered a beer and chicken steak. And the food was just AWESOME - perfectly cooked chicken, veggies and potato mash. Since the food is a little expensive the bill came out to be Rs890 for just a steak and beer. Thus not suitable for the price conscious or the average spender. For the HOOKAH LOVERS: THIS PLACE SERVES HOOKAH And MUSIC WAS QUITE GOOD The only downside to all the positives : SERVICE - I APPRECIATE A WELL INFORMED STAFF BUT HOW GOOD WOULD SOMEONE BE IF THEY CAN'T EXPLAIN THE MENU IN ENGLISH.

Located in the outer circle near Monkey Bar, the interiors are done up nicely and the outdoor area is fine for a summer evening with the water mist and the huge fans. Although there's no view like Qba. Coming to the food we ordered two Roman dishes: Piftie and Frigrui, because we specifically were looking to try the cuisine. The Piftie, essentially chicken served with a sauce was very well cooked, soft and delicious. The Frigrui was lamb based and the kebab resembling dish looked very nice but the lamb was undercooked. So tough was the meat that we couldn't chew on it. Although the food left much to be desired the drinks were perfect.

I went with my special friend Bhavesh Nigam and the menu of the place is quite interesting having the options of Roman, Continental, Chinese, Indian, and Afghani food. We started off with Fratelli Sangiovese and Fratelli Classic Merlot red wine and Non-Veg Kebab Platter, which was great. We moved on and ordered Prawn Curry and Garlic Naan which was so amazingly lip-licking awesome! To finish off, we had Chicken Briyani and Black & White whiskey along with it.

Sheesha was pretty awesome and not vry expensive. Coming to the drinks they did not hav any happy hours even during the day which is a bit dissappointing.

I went there with a special friend and this was how this restaurant depicted perfection. First of all, the staff was outrightly corteous and were at your service. The comfortable chairs, the high ceilings, the beautiful walls and the the lighting with right brightness (offered a lounge kind of feeling) all complimented the ambiance. The music played was some nice english hot r&b/ hip hop songs and at the right volume that I could very easily talk my heart out to my friend. We ordered all american, Indian and chinese (though restricted it to veg) and the food was finger licking good. The cocktails were also served in a nice way and tasted good.

At entry there is a tall man standing who explained us IPL liquor deals which was selling at 6 Corona 1 starter @ 1950. He treated us well but when we entered & had a seat, soon we asked waiter 2 serve that deal which we were told at entry. He told us, he doesn't have Corona but he can give us Amstel but we wanted Corona only as it was told us at the time of entry. When I informed him abt this, he went downstairs & confirmed it. Later he again approached us & showed us some new 'Beera' beer in same package which we didn't want bcos we never listened abt this new beer. We again said we want Corona then he replied, we'll give u Corona bcos u were committed but that won't b available in combo deal. We were very disturbed with this kind of poor hospitality of staff. 1st we were told u'll get this deal, when we entered, we were denied. Then again something new was offered ua which when we denied then they agreed 2 offer us same beer but without combo. It was Monday that's y it wasn't crowded but inside, he was still showing arrogance.

Since my friend doesn't eat non vegetarian food, we had to stick to veg fare. Wanted to try out the Romanian food since its supposed to be served only at this outlet but couldn't as there wasn't even a single veg dish in the Romanian menu. Ambience: very cool. I really liked the high ceiling. Since they were only letting people in on the first floor, never got around to checking out the place totally. There weren't too many ppl but enough to not feel creepy. My friend and I, after having quite a few years, could talk freely without any noise.

Kanika Patoria,"Rated Lying in the outer circle of CP and can be easily spotted on the main road. This was my first visit to this great cafe. Ambience: Optimally lit and interiors in good tune with the furniture layed out. The combination of red with beige and brown gives the place a decent look. The lower floor is great on a hot day. However, the lower floor is generally booked on weekends. So if you plan on visiting on one of the hot holidays, be sure to make a booking. I say this coz we went there without a booking on a hot Saturday and were immediately moved to the top floor. Half of this is an open area (great for winters) and the other half is centrally A/Ced but the A/C seemed ineffective on the warm day. Food/Drinks: We took Deal 3 our of the Combo menu. The veg starter Potato and Cheese pops were delicious! The beer bottles were well served in a red bucket full of ice. The prices for food wern't too exorbitant. So a good place to hang out with family and friends. The staff was polite and cooperative. Overall, an experience to take me there again :)",Rated 4.0,24,191,??

Anshul Duggal,"Rated Was looking for a new place in CP for mom's birthday and this place just opened up a week ago. So, here it goes: 1) for starters we ordered Brie Mushroom (Baked Cheese and Mushrooms) which was just right and with good presentation too. 2) fried fish was fine but their own tartar dip was great. 3) now what really made me write this review was their butter chicken. Normally, you won't expect a great butter chicken in a Cafe/ Lounge setup but you have got to try out the butter chicken man. (And this is coming from a guy who likes Bhape and Havemore, so you gotta trust me on this!) Service could be better but then it was new so I am gonna let it slide! :)",Rated 4.0,6,118,??

Amongst the melancholy summers on a deserted road we found these words as glass of wine. One could not count the moons that shimmer on their roofs, Or the thousand splendid suns that they hide behind walls. Three tier restaurant with a moonlight view relaxes laid back view or a view to see by lanes of cp. Service is like being served by ninjas serving at your will and disappearing at your will . Food and ambience epitomes the metanoia that you take as you enter. Be it drinks mojito or sunshine or tender succulent Beijing chicken or luscious dal makhani or tantalizing chicken pesto it is ensured that evening you spent will always go down the memory lane as you gulp those large portions.

Srj,"Rated There are now many new places in Cp and almost all of them look the same but Kinbuck 2 is different and is a welcome addition. I quite liked this place. The name is funny and no point to look for sense in it though it is derived from Timbuktu Location & Ambience: It is located at the Outer circle at Cp near Saravana bhawan. The entry to the place is not that good but once inside the whole setting surprises and in a good way. The restaurant is spread across 2 floors like a duplex and the tall ceiling gives good volume to the place. The seating on lower level is decent and the bar is nice too but I really liked the different Al fresco seating on the terrace; the tall seating benches are lil uncomfortable but fine. The long cartoon posters on the walls are really interesting. Menu/food: The menu is massive and with a lot of options. I was with a friend and we decided to order dishes for ourselves. I was looking for something comparatively healthy so had nachos with guacamole, & a cottage cheese steak. The nachos were decent in taste but looked like a packed commercial product, and the salsa dip was nice but guacamole was average, the steak was one of the good ones that I have had as the ratatouille tomato sauce topping blended really well with steak, the mashed potatoes were nice too. In mocktail, we had a virgin mojito which was quite refreshing. My friend did not like the dish she had and we told the staff about it. They were courteous enough to replace it and gave a complementary brownie dessert which sadly was not that good too but it was a good gesture. The service was fine but he staff that was initially assigned to our table was not knowledgable at all and so the manager assigned someone else who was helpful and courteous. The only downer if I can say was that we heard the owner talk some sense into the manager for a lot of things and coz he was loud so we got to hear it though we did not want to. They should discuss such matters not in the company and in front of diners. These might be initial teething problems which get settled with time. Still Kinbuck 2 is a good place to visit overall and has many things going in their favour. Meal cost around 2000.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Aditi Gupta,"Rated Lots of positive reviews and ratings on Zomato made me check out this place recently, but it failed to live upto the expectation. It does have a variety ofseating options - the one on the ground floor which has a lounge like feel to it, and 3 small sections on the first floor, each offering something different. But the menu and the food both were a disappointment and the service was just okay too.

The chef is warm and competent and knows what people love and gives it to them on time - the staff is involved and attentive The only thing I would want is a bit of a more adventurous dessert menu and maybe a better execution - but hey that's just splitting hairs - all in all I am definitely going back and telling everyone to try it :)),Rated 4.5,35,62,??

Divanshu Dubey,"Rated The restaurant has a fab location and an equally exciting ambience. It calls itself a Roman bistro and the owner seems to have taken pains to give it the Mediterranean look. Not only that, a section of the menu also does full justice to the theme. For vegetarians I recommend the cottage cheese stakes, the falafel wraps and ravioli. Other Italian and Mediterranean options also looked good. Really enjoyed the wide collection of home baked roman and other breads. There has been a lot of effort put in by the chef here to make things happen. Amazing stuff flows from the bar as well. For the teetotaller the mocktails K2 and cherry mojito (virgin) are highly recommended.",Rated 4.0,18,44,??

Aparna Arya,"Rated A boho-chic industrial loft look that houses a neat lounge style eatery, with the brick in-lay walls and a huge television on one end; which is visible throughout the floor plan for screenings of your favourite sports events live. Even on a weekday the place is packed and doing great with their biggest tables occupied by groups of family as well as friends alike. The entrance is a stairway to the first floor which opens onto a glass fronted wine rack acting as a privacy screen for people sitting in the lounge behind it. The bar on the opposite end from the huge television boosts some rather comfy looking bar seats (can't call them stools when they have such nice cushioning) The cuisines offered are Italian, Mediterranean, Chinese & North Indian. And here's what all we tried starting with the heroes: - the Vegetable Dum Biryani - with crunchy veggies, flavours of Kewra, the aroma & colour of saffron and a mouth-wateringly gorgeous savouriness - the Mushroom stuffed Ravioli in a tomato & basil sauce - delicately flavoured, perfectly cooked squares of mushroomy goodness with the elevatingly delicate tomato & basil sauce - the Fried Stuffed Chicken - with the moist juicy chicken encapsulated by the crispy fried exterior - the Rocket salad - I personally this salad leaf to exclusion of all else and this salad is a fresh reminder of why I do!! - the Pan seared Scallops - moist pillowy delicate gorgeousness accompanied by a corn pure and rocket leaves drizzled with balsamic vinegar - the scallops were a tad salty though - the Frigrui - chicken kebabs served on hanging skewers with the aroma of charcoal oven with three distinct dips - the Roganjosh - the curry was average and the mutton was a tad underdone, not decimating on every bite - the Soya Kebabs - uniquely distinct flavours The cocktails I had were special mixes from the bartender but each was not quite to my palate - the first a rum based cocktail with spicy undertones and the second a vodka based cocktail with cherry juice. The best dessert was the Tiramisu, closely followed by the eggless red velvet, blueberry cheesecake and brownie with ice cream - none of which really left an impression.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The ambience on the roof is enjoyable in evenings when the lights on the trees, the board saying ""Lie to me and say that you love me"" and the Einstein bulbs are lit.

Sidhant Ahuja,Rated After hearing so much about this place I finally decided to give it a visit. The place is located at the P block on the outer circle. It is on the first floor. It occupies two floor. The upper floor has two sections one which is open and the other one is indoor. The ambience is good. The lightining is very dim. The outer terrace has a large LCD screen. The view from the terrace is speactular you can even see the flag very clearly. Now lets come to the food. Chicken steak with veggies was good served with mashed potatoes and a side sauce it was good. Chicken scaloppini was good too served with a sunny side up egg in a capsicum. The presentation was really good. But there was no difference in the two dishes. It tasted same. Now the best dish that i liked was the Falafele A Diaz E Tahine it was served with chicken and pita bread was so soft and hummus tasted really good. Crispy fish was good too the quantity was really good served with a lot of fries and two dips again presenation was upto the mark. Now since it is a roman bistro we planned to order a dish from the roman menu. We ordered Tochitur now this dish was basically rice and chicken curry along with a side salad. For some reason i did not like this dish maybe iam not too much familiar with the cusine. We even got a glass of wine alongwith this dish. It is a good place to chill out with your friends.

Akshika Bansal,"Rated Went there in afternoon as the weather was good. Ambiance was nice with comfortable seating. However, my experience was not that great as: First disappointment was that they do not serve their Romanian cuisine without wine. Secondly, their Lehmban Shish Kebab was stale. It was so hard that I could hardly chew it and to save the embarrassment had to swallow my first bite, worrying about food poisoning simultaneously! However, service was good as they replaced it with a chicken substitute which tasted well. Their Ravioli (veg) was delicious. The pasta pockets were perfectly thin and the consistency of sauce was good. Had the mushrooms in the ravioli filling not been diced so thinly, the taste could have been better.

We ordered an extensive range of items, from the basics like Chilli Chicken, Chicken Tikkas, Butter Chicken to the likes of Dahi Kebabs, Crispy Chicken Bites, various pizzas, pastas and much more, with all the items having amazing taste, surprisingly much of the menu was still left undiscovered.

Third is rooftop and open. I like it. Service: It is good. But just sometimes there is no one outside to call. We gotta wait for someone to come. But rarely. Else it is fast. Food: -crispy chicken bites are crispy and tasty. But nothing great K2 ke stuffed fried chicken looks good but tastes average. Sauces they serve are good Dark chocolate shake is yumm. If I go again.

The brick arches are very common now obviously. Food wise too the place was quite below average. Our fish and chicken soup despite fancy names was bad. The drinks were okay as we stocked to basics martini and beer. Fried prawns were over fried so we called the waiter to replace them. He took it to kitchen and came back 5 minutes later stating the chef says it's okay. You can guess our retort after that and we asked for the bill. They unashamedly still put prawns in bill.

Coming to the food, we ordered their Veg Starters platter- Rancher's Fries, penne arrabiatta, caprioska, LIIT and a red velvet pastry. The staff was really generous as when we asked for extra breads with our pasta, they happily served. While the starters were pretty average, the pasta was totally relishing and filling. The red velvet pastry was also very soft and delicious. My LIIT was perfectly done and I totally enjoyed it with my meal. Overall we had a great time and would really look forward to visit the place again.

Sahil Chopra,"Rated Read a couple of articles online and wanted to try this place To be honest i was confused with the ambience and the menu The place had tried fusion of Morrocan and urban lounge with good servings of sheesha (3.5/5) The menu was vast, from italian to american burgers to lebanese to chinese this place went haldiram-ish all the way. Why i'm saying this is because food wasn't too great (3.5/5) The quesadilla were fine though, pasta on the other hand was raw, under cooked and the marinara was too dry. Shish taouk was a joke. It was no where close to Lebanese and tasted pure punjabi chicken tikka.

The best thing about ye food was - It was smokingly hot which me and my wife liked the most. Dahi ke kebabs were awesome. One thing that I didn't like was that the Garlic bread that was served along with the pasta was way too overcooked (it had actually turned Black). Music was good.

Nimisha Arora,Rated I am always in mood of exploring nice and unique places and found this one. And that too specially on my birthday. As like any one else I was also damn excited as I was throwing the party. We were a group of 5 people and started our order with a maharaja hookah. It took some time for preparing and presenting it but we didnt mind that much as we all were in good mood :). We then ordered 2 veg platters as starters and beer and vodka. After enjoying our meal I personally wanted to celebrate the day with a champagne however the restaurant didnt hav the desired brand but to their generosity they arranged the same. We end up with some great memories of kinbuck 2 and of my birthday too. Over all its a nice and supportive place just in the Centre of delhi I.e Cp and have vallet parking too.

Sangeeta Bahuguna,"Rated KINBUCK2 is the cute roman bistro style restaurant opened nearly a month back at the heart of city, CP Outer Circle. Its in two floors with an open sit out to enjoy the nice weather and hustle and bustle of CP. Anshul Garg the young entrepreneur and Chef Anay Mukherjee has brought cuisine from world over to us likes of Lebanese, Chinese, Maxican, Italian and Indian too. Had tried some awesome kababs like Chicken Kubideh and Fish Kubideh kabab, which were well marinated and very attractively presented in a long seekh and tasted good. Dahi kababs were soft and tasted too but did`nt quite like Bhutiya kabab made of corn so has to be a bit sweet, which I personally don`t relish in a kabab ( sweetness i e ). Crispy chicken in chilly bean sauce was a nice dish with slices of chicken with veges. All their dips like humus, tahini, tabuleh and baba ganoush were excellent and presented well as accompaniments. Their signature drinks like K2 which is made with fresh watermelon, apple chunks and lemon juice is refreshing as so is RD special, a cocktail with Old Monk, Lemon Juice and fresh orange juice. Can`t end a good meal without a nice dessert and their blue berry cheese cake is a must have!! A nice place to enjoy a good meal, the average cost per person would be around 7- 800/-.

Coming to the food , I would not say that it's the best food arnd.... I was personally not very satisfied by few of the servings !!!! The chilly paneer was very nice and pasta was decent...

The ambiance of the place is just right. Such a beautiful setting. Great usage of space and plants. It feel good sitting there with natural sunlight. The food was a disappointment because they do not have as such roman food to look forward too. The food they serve is great. The shrimp cocktail is yum yum. But then again roman food is missing. The cherry mojito and shakes are to die for. Service was great. Waiters and managers were very well coordinated. All smiles which was nice. Bill was for 1500 which I thought was not worth it. But the biggest let down was no roman food which is kind of misleading. But rest of everything is amazing. On the pandameter - 2.5 **1/2,Rated 2.5,82,185,??

Food Abuse,"Rated Gone are the days when only good food or great ambience used to work as a U.S.P. for a restaurant to be successful. In the age of advancement it could be just about anything, like todays feature which is Kinbuck 2, located in P block, Connaught place. The differentiating factor is parking space of more than hundred cars in a park located just behind them. Flipping through a bit of geography shows that Kinbuck is a small town located in Scotland, which had a Bistro by same name.Thats where the owners of this place went and were highly moved, hence the name, which literally means a second Kinbuck. The place is under careful watch of expat chef Anay Mukherjee who has spent years in Lebanon and England and even boasts of serving the royal family in Britain. I was a guest on board with TWCI (The Writers Collective of India) to try the all-new Roman curations with a mix of Lebanese.The menu was extensive, and I was unwilling to leave anything untried so I stuck to only bite size portions which still left me in dreamy state. The first thing on the table was Toba, which is cured lamb leg, which was succulent and well complimented with some assorted breads from across the globe. A specific type that stood out was the Dutch bread, which is slowly baked for almost a day till it develops the cracks over it automatically as an escape vent for the air trapped inside its called The Tiger bread. Next in line were Prawn Tempuras which were beautifully fried with great crunchy crusts, followed by chicken Chatak-Matak and Chicken Shish Kawab both the meats had mild flavours and were cooked in a way that would put the finest of restaurants to shame. What came next cast a certain spell on me Ardei-Umpluti, which is a form of stuffed bell-peppers; one variant of vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian. The bell-pepper was shining in all its glory and could be torn apart with one slit of a knife, and the stuffing just worked magic. It was a quick trip to Japan with the assorted sushi but the excessive wasabi already rubbed on the sushi got my flight back to senses through Timbuktu where my brain froze for almost a minute. The next thing being plated was Sarmale, which is stuffed cabbage roll with sour cream that tasted average only because the multiple rolls of complete cabbage leaves didnt work that well as a complete package. The last order was Piftie, which was stuffed chicken breast; it made me a complete couch potato for the next 2 hours and I could not even dare to flip on the dessert section. The whole experience can be summed in an easy statement that the chef knows his meat very well and can do wonders with it. secondlastsupper.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,125,309,??
Sapna Bains,"Rated Good place to go for cocktails and drinks in general. Really nice ambience. However their food kind of brings the rating down a smidge. We only had starter items; nothing was horrible but nothing was awesome either. Pretty decent, just not something I'd be tempted to order again.

Uvika Sahni,"Rated My first visit and very much impressed by their hospitality, ambience and the food as well. Ambience and cuisines highlighting the Roman culture makes it the first bistro in delhi. I ordered a virgin mojito, cool colin which seemed overpriced to me with starters hind smoked mutton galauti which was superior and veg indian platter which was equally heart-rending because of the sweet tinch in the 2 out of four types served in the platter. The paneer and veg kenabs were the live savers for us in that platter. I would recommend not to have this but will definately recommend the gaulati veg kebabs. A negative point could be the menu.

Pita bread was fluffy and soft. Cottage Cheese Steak grilled tangy cottage cheese topped with ratatouille and tomato sauce was perfect. Crispy chicken in Chilly Bean Sauce where sliced chicken served with veggies and chilli bean sauce was done well but will prefer with less of salt and sauce.

Rajeev Nangia,"Rated Had visited this restro bar , the day it opened. Located on upper floors , above Prem Sagar Guest House , the location that has turned into a kind of focal point for reasonably priced restro pubs . With Castel 9 & 3 Monkeys in the same block and a My Bar , just across the road. The first thing that hits a visitor on entering here is the vast space and that effect is heightened by the high ceilings. The place is spread over two levels with the upper level further divided into 3 separate sections including an open balcony. There is loads of hip wall art but what I did not really like was the low lightning. Being their first day of service , the staff was a bit confused and the service though polite was not really efficient , a big negative in this highly competitive neighbourhood . As I was a part of a very large group on one of the all you can eat and drink package , I did not get to order a la cart but snacked and dinned on the house snacks and a buffet dinner. The quality of snacks served was very ordinary , with nothing really standing out , the regular banquet hall variety , I actually do not remember even a single snack I had there , so un appealing . The North Indian dinner was better but equally uneventful. A very ordinary experience overall. I may go back if I am around there or I may decide to go into any of the scores of similar outlets around there , so not highly recommended till they get there act together and make their food and service really stand out , very very average as of now :( ENJOY",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Priyanka Beck,"Rated Tucked in a tiny spot at The P Block is the new kid in town, Kinbuck 2. We easily got a table for 4 at the first floor. The staff maintained courtesy and interaction, which I really appreciated. The suggested Estonian beer did not make a mark. The shrimp cocktail could do with less coleslaw and more shrimps. The Roast Leg of Lamb saved the day, would suggest this to all the meat lovers. The pop art wall was something that kept me glued to my seat. They play a mixture of genres like commercial EDM, Rock Fusion and even Sufi. The ground floor has spacious lounge areas for large groups. However, I would always prefer the wooden high stools at the terrace for the fresh air and just because I love eating under the stars. Owing to the fact that this place is just one month old, it has a long way to go in terms of food and music.

A cadbury hot choco satchet gives a cremier taste than this. Then we came to the starters. We ordered a fattoush salad and a parmesan chicken strips. The salad was just fine while the latter was lovely and succulent. For the main course we ordered chilly jumbo prawn with chilli garlic noodles. The noodles were great with a hint of garlic bang on but the jumbo prawn were equally complementing it. Portion siZe is great. A good place to be with friends but can be avoided.",Rated 3.0,38,121,??
Aanchal Goel,Rated A cafe I got to know through an acquaintance. We were in a large group and ordered variety of starters and main course ( letting this know incase you people think I have such an appetite) We ordered: Manchow and lemon corriander soup but both had the same base. In the former one the prominent taste was of burnt garlic and in latter one just lemon held the strings. This is not a place for soup lovers. An assorted platter of breads was provided as a complimentary starter with our soups. Surprisingly it had some tastiest assortments. In starters we had Dhai kebab that were quite amazing but very oily. The Mix topping veg pizza was just okay . You can even live happily without ordering it. The Crispy corn pepper were quite delicious. The Salt and pepper vegetables are worth having if you visit this cafe! Otherwise it's fine . You don't need to specially visit this place for this starter. You can go for Virgin mojito as well. A perfect summer drink ! Dal makhni and Paneer adraki were good for a hungry stomach. At the end we even got complimentary brownie. The texture was quite hard . But a piece of brownie with a vanilla scoop can always make your day .,Rated 3.5,38,204,??

Apoorva Murali,Rated Very average food and the interiors are sort of dark and dingy. Somehow the food didn't impress despite several rave reviews for the place. We left after starters as the place seemed too expensive for the sub par food that was being served. The milk shakes were average as well. It may be possible that we didn't order the right things as others have written good things about this place.,Rated 3.0,32,43,??

Dim light ambience which you get as reflection is just more than pleasant to welcome you. The new Roman bistro have less to offer for vegetarians but what matters is the quality.

Since its a recent addition to the list of restaurants in CP, I think very few people know about it. I visited during the evening hours with a friend, the place wasn't crowded, which is usually a plus point for me. We ordered a mix of mughlai and italian and the spread tasted awesome.

Ambika Sukumar,"Rated To be honest with you all , it was first time in Delhi , I had a meat which was well cured and well prepared . The meat melts in the mouth ,fat of the meat was visibly melting right infront of eyes when Chef delicately honored the meat and sliced the peaces to its ultimate fate . I was curious how much time did he take to cure meat ( Pork ) ... The Chef was nice to reveal his secret that ... he cured the meat for around 36 hrs in rock salt and he grilled the meat for 6 long hrs . It was awesome sight to see the meat getting grilled and then Chef right in front the audience made the final presentation ... The presentation was galant . For a moment I thought , Iam a part of roman civilization and right in front of emperor Caesar ... Emperor Caesor was said host lavish dinners where wine and meat were essential . With that kind of meat ... The chef plated the bread ... It was sight . Photographers moment . All kind of bread from the world was right on the table . Ofcourse the meat was the main attraction of this story ... But the cameo was baby raddish .. nicely caramelized though crunchy . With that the asparagus ... just one word ... uumf ...crunch is there ... . not charred . Roman food is not complete with out cheese and Wine ... Cheese was excellent . Aging of cheese left the mouth salivating which was timely cured with the red wine . Red wine left a sweet sensation post the cheese melted in the mouth . ambikasukumar.wordpress.com",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Ritika Bhattacharya,"Rated Had already been pre-hyped by my girlfriend about this place -it's launch,the food and ambience - and Was waiting to try out a Delhi's. Being an ""almost"" dry day and weekday eve -was pretty empty but all the more helped to enhance the ""gigantism"",grandeur & the grafitti -so in nutshell being a perfect mixture of the old school brick wall classy charm along with the modernity of the colors n lights all over ;though we took to sitting upstairs & relishing upon the ""smoothest"" hookah of a Paan Flavor; Brownie points- ANY place playing Rihanna,Adele,JT or Bey -hell yeah you already Won me there! But yes Bhavya Nakra@bhavye were almost lucky enough to enjoy a refreshingly sweet classic whisky cocktail and greeted upon by a complimentary bread basket (was too pretty to be disturbed too!) followed by the Classic ceasar's - aptly salted n lemony,with the perfect ""extras"" of black olives!before going to the mains- a special notice of the extremely soft & fresh crisp of the multigrains/garlic breads-turned out its an in-house preparation itself!took the popular ""Roulade"" which has Always been my favourite of all Continentals -but for the first time -got them chopped,slithered & stuffed so smooth n succulently with the right veggies & buttered sauces- making each bite a Delight;the wooden pizza - top marks for the thinnest & crunch pest base with ample cheese n chicken to top off each bite! Even the pita bread-so fluffed n yet thinned out & easy on teeth & tongue- which for me is a rarity.a special mention- an extremely courteous & a caring staff- completely in command n knowledge of it all-the menu to the Coals! The winter chills added on to the warmth n fuzz of the place and yes it takes the night sky to enlighten the place even more - the only lactation which this 15days baby needs is ""the crowd""- it's got all the ingredients laid out fresh n ready -to play it out and perform But just requires a further recognition,the chirpy, the crazy and All within to really reach n realise it's potential;on that note and realization I'll be heading out Soon Enough! ;)",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The paint on d wall is very interesting..bar looks promising .. We chose to sit on d terrace which has bright orange couches. Again very beautiful! Coming to food.. We asked d staff to help us choose a starter which is one of their best. He suggested us cheese sambousek and hence we ordered that along with white sauce pasta and dark chocolate plus strawberry peach shake. Cheese sambousek had cheese filling and the cheese tasted sour and stale. When we told them abt it, they asked us to change the order very politely. So we orderd dahi kebab instead. Shakes were thick n tasty. Pasta tasted delicious but again dahi kebab were disappointing. At last we ordered cappuccino which was too too strong and that was accompanied by chocolate brownie which was on d house... :D Extra 0.5 keeping in mind that it is newly opened.

Aditya Bhasin,"Rated Well, well, well ! I usually do not try out ""this"" new places so early yet I was at K2 yesterday. I wanted to sit at the rooftop side but it was booked for a private party so the folks at K2 suggested that they can put up a table and chair at at another open but not operational section of the cafe (kudos for putting so much efforts). Yet, I choose to sit at the inside section of cafe and my over all experience was exceptionally good. The staff was absolutely happy to attend us and take feedback. (Well, they were too kin for that). The food was good and so was the ambience. When you go to their terrace, for a second you feel that the roof above you is painted as sky but it is actually open sky. The place turned out to be a great place and the most important part was food was good and so was the service - with a pinch of delay in terms of serving. I was glad to be served by Satya (if I remember his name correctly) He was kin to take feedback. My friend had asked for a feedback form but they didn't have one and I told her that I will share it on Zomato too but she was so pleased with the space that she happen to write a note of appreciation at the order book Satya was carrying. I would surely visit this place another time but not very often. And yes, Thanks K2 folks for a complementary chocolate brownie.",Rated 3.5,8,55,??

Abhiram Bidwai,"Rated Kinbuck 2 is one of the newest restaurants in CP. If you're driving in a hurry, you just might miss this store. Tad less visibility due to trees. Ambience - Going up the first floor, you are greeted by a grand piece of work. Easily the finest in CP. Done in tones of red and grey, the restaurant is well lit and very spacious. The sky lit ceiling and brick wall arches signify the theme. Comic style wallpaper adds freshness. All these elements actually exhibit the kind of love gone into the designing of the place. Menu - According to manager, it was in the beta stage, wasn't designed in the best way. I mean, when you call yourself a Roman bistro, you've got to serve some traditional Roman cuisine (?) Service - We were greeted well the entrance and escorted to our table. Manager showed us the place nicely. Staff was well motivated, happy and very courteous. Food/Beverages - Hand cut fries were way way way too oily. Nachos came from a packet. Manager was happy to replace them for us. Nevertheless, replacement appetisers were very good. A kind of paneer tikka was terrific, tender paneer cubes with great taste and beautiful presentation. And I guess freezer to fryer French fries work with everyone. Apple cinnamon and cream cheese tart was pretty good. Couldn't try the cocktails as they were still in development. They had a decent range of bottled beers. Looking forward to check this place once again very soon. All the best guys! Damage - 1000/head Will I visit again? - Yes abhirambidwai.wordpress.com",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Ginny,"Rated A new place to dine our and very near to work place so I was wanting to go here since it opened. Today while catching up with a friend we decided to have lunch here. The interiors are nice and creative. They have got an open air arrangement at the terrace and two floors of indoors!! Pretty big it is. Wanted to sit outdoors but was too cold so we decided to be indoors. We were welcomed nicely.. Being a Wednesday afternoon it was almost empty.. To eat we ordered a penne pasta in mushroom and white sauce and a chicken roulade. Pasta was tasty and creamy, the way it should have been. The roulade had a beautiful presentation.. Was stuffed with veggies and cheese. Was served with potato mash, grilled vegetables and mushroom sauce. Roulade per say was good. Mash was fine though it could have been better.. Needed a little less salt and bit more of herbs and cream!! We also ordered a dark chocolate shake. The shake was tasty, not very thick and was a regular chocolate shake rather than a dark chocolate one.. Though it tasted nice. We did not order for a dessert and the brought us two small pieces of some chocolate cake which was on the house. The chocolate cake was a bliss!! Service was good and the staff was friendly!
