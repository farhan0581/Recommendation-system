Dillichatori,"Rated If you are looking to try out Lebanese food, mezze platter is the right thing for you. Hummus, Fattoush, Labneh with Zaatar, Falafel, Mixed Pickles, Tahini Sauce & Pita Bread is what you will get. Everything tastes decent and you will love it if you are a Lebanese food fan. Also the ambiance is great specially on the second floor. A good Sunday dinner place.",Rated 4.0,13,23,??
Gopika Kaul,"Rated So before we went here, we read some reviews, and it seemed nice. It was, except for one thing - there is some belly dancing that happens on the first floor. Not being particularly interested in sitting among drunken men getting cheap thrills out of watching East European women (this is Delhi, you can imagine what Belly Dancing does to men in this city) we sat on the ground floor. We thought, to each his own and so long as we sit downstairs, it should be ok. Well, it was a bit of an issue - because the men upstairs kept swooning loudly and they kept upping the music, till I had to ask a waiter to turn it down. I mean one goes to a bar if one wants to shout over music (and in that case the music is to your liking, not typical belly dancing type that gets a bit much after a while). At a casual dining place such as this, one is looking for good food and some nice conversation - the latter is a bit tough, because the place is small and ""upstairs"" is like right above your head. They should say this upfront - tell us what's in store, so the ones who want an experience like this can go, the others can head somewhere else. I frankly felt like I was sitting under some some dance bar.. Now for some positives. The staff is courteous and the food is good - fresh and tasty, so they got that part right. We ordered the Hot Mezze Platter which has both veg and non veg snacks, and that was nice. For the main course we had rolls - I had the spicy falafal and my husband had the lamb one - yumm.. And yes, one more thing, the only wine they have is Fratelli - so if you love nice selection of wines, then this is not the place for you. We ordered it, was not bad. But I would have preferred to have been given a choice.",Rated 3.0,18,46,??

Pridhi Madan,Rated I love this place. Never disappointed me I have stayed in dubai for 14 years and love the food there. In Delhi i was missing that food and after visiting Zizo i don't miss dubai that much. Their zatar is amazing and chicken and cheese manoush is just too Good.,Rated 4.5,3,31,??
Aditya Sachdeva,"Rated I visited Zizo yesterday (14th February) for a lunch. The place is not unique in terms of its infrastructure or ambiance, however, that won't disappoint you. Zizo plays some music which most of us listen to, but have probably forgotten about, giving the touch of some nostalgia while they take about 20 minutes to prepare your order. We (Me and the accompanying friend) ordered a Veg. Cheese Falafel Burger and Penne Arrabiata with a Lebanese twist, with a Cosmopolitan & a Sangria. Firstly, their food is really heavy. We were absolutely full; there was no capacity for any desserts. However, whatever we had was absolutely delicious. The potato wedges served with the burger were probably the best potato wedges I have had. The Arrabiata wasn't as spicy as other review may tell you - but then it probably depends on one's appetite for spicy food. The cosmopolitan wasn't the best cosmopolitan we had, but nonetheless it was satisfactory. Caution for Wine drinkers: If you're too habitual of getting the perfect Wine glasses for your Red Wine, you might be disappointed with the quality of their Wine glasses. The Sangria, otherwise tasted fine. The prices were reasonable - and definitely worth the quality of the food. Two (alcoholic) drinks, two dishes costed about 1600 (with all the taxes).",Rated 4.0,4,38,??
Aikant Bhatti,"Rated Visited zizo, with colleagues for lunch. The ambience is Ok, the tables and chair need to be a bit more comfortable. The service has a lag factor and needs improvement. The pitta bread was soft and fluffy 5/5 and Hummus, was great, however the garnishing with the herbs was missing, i would rate it 4/5. The meeze platter we ordered was ok, there was nothing inspiring there for me to eat. I won't recommend but you can try at your own risk, they say its leabenesse food, but to me it appears a distant cousion...",Rated 3.0,33,26,??

Kriti Chopra,"Rated Not sure how my best-half came across this lil restaurant tucked in the corner of K block in CP. It's a Lebanese place, giving u a full Arabic feeling. Out of the world hookah!!

Aviralkh,"Rated The place is easy to locate, opened in K block..they have a ground and a floor seating. First the serve u with some eatable stick and cucumber sauce which was ON THE HOUSE..! The seating was nice and ambience was very elegant.. The music was mostly arabian. To go with the rating Service : 3.5/5 Food : 2.5/5 Ambience: 4/5 Food: We ordered a veggy cheese pizza which ruined things for us. It was undercooked. It lacked veggies, spices and the most important the taste. Drinks: Virgin mojito and watermelon splash both the drinks were good and bang on taste.

Aishwarya Singh,"Rated The negative points first: Portions are quite small, you need to order a lot to be full In middle east humus is virtually served with every dish for free, we had to order humus couple of times(which costed as much as a dish itself) Good points: Taste wise the kebabs are impeccable, apart from the chicken which was a little dry Everything had a nice and rich flavor,especially the meat and the dips. Good food, but not the best Lebanese in Delhi/NCR.",Rated 3.0,30,22,??
Manpreet Kaur,"Rated Ambience: Before visiting this place in real, I went through the pictures on zomato and the colorful decor of the place caught my attention. I liked the mix and match of the colors. They have done it in a very mild and sophisticated manner. Nothing too bold. Nothing too experimental. Just cool. The place makes you feel calm. A good place to sit and have long conversations. Food Overall, the food was good. It was well presented and tasty. Here's a detail on what I ate. 1. Traditional Hummus with Tahini:This dish with chickpeas dipped in sesame paste and lemon juice, wasn't that good. There was nothing special about the dish. As a salad, it failed to impress me. It wasn't yuck! But it wasn't yum either. Taste of lemon was hardly there and chickpeas were boiled a bit too much. There wasn't any other flavor in the dish. It was just bland. 2. Provencale Chicken Wings:I loved these. The dish consists of chicken lollipops dipped in lemon and coriander sauce. The chicken was soft and juicy. There was a perfect flavor of lemon and coriander sauce. 3. Penne Arrabiata with Lebanese Twist: this is spicy penne pasta with tomato sauce and zaatar. The pasta was tasty but it wasn't the best pasta I have tried. I have had much better red sauce pasta and at a lot of places. 4. Chocolate cake with halawa: The dish consists of a brownie topped with halawa sauce and hazelnuts. It was yum. The brownie was perfect and the sauce made it even better. Service It was quick and nice. Final Verdict I loved the place because of the ambience and service. The food wasn't awesome, but neither it was bad. A couple of dishes were yummy. Some were average. Nothing was horribly bad, which is great. I think it would have been great if I would have got bigger servings for the price I was paying for each thing. The place might not be the best one if you consider value for money. But again, there is nothing I hated about the place. It's good. Give it a try, if you want to eat out at a different place for once. finixpost.com",Rated 3.5,15,270,??
Lokesh Meena,"Rated It's an amazing place with 3-4 sitting areas, so so won't feel the crowd. Waiters were really professional. Interior gave Mediterranean feel. And the most amazing thing I want to tell you is, when we went there they were playing some Mediterranean or Lebanese songs( I guess). And there was a smoking hot belly dancer and her costume was even more sexy. She danced on 3-4 songs. Really loved the experience i.e. Having dinner and watching belly dance. Now coming back to ZiZo.in food we ordered pasta and rolls and they were delectable. Music( I didn't get the lyric) was amazing. Over all a great place for new experience and new food.",Rated 3.5,32,16,??

Rahul Jha,Rated This is definitely one of the best places in New Delhi to grab an authentic Middle Eastern cuisine and what makes this place special is the attention to the presentation of the food which is quite impressive here. also the chef as I was told by the waiter happens to be from Lebanon so that explains the authentic food that we received here.having said that the staff although quite courteous and polite need some additional training with regards to explaining the food and coming up with recommendations based on conversations with the clients,Rated 5.0,9,195,??
Anoop Kamath,"Rated We had dinner at Zizo and it turned out to be a wonderful experience. Yesterday, we were at Zizo's by 8.00 pm since we wanted to have an early dinner. We ordered our drinks and settled in. We were given a complimentary starter of Roasted Pita Strips with a cucumber, onion, curd dip. We ordered Hummus Ras Asfour which is traditional hummus topped with chicken with sumac and pomegranate butter sauce. This came with fluffy pita breads and I must admit that these were the best pita breads, I have ever tasted. The hummus was divine and I loved the tangy and buttery sauce. We were also given a garlic dip to taste. This had garlic, olive oil and curd whisked into a smooth, velvety, dip. This dip was good with the Rolled Grilled Lamb Kebab which came next. The roll was served with onion salad, sumac, pickled vegetables and hummus. I liked the pickled veggies which were crunchy and tangy at the same time. The last dish we ordered was Moroccan Tajine Chicken which was slow cooked veggies with aromatic saffron broth served with Couscous. This dish predominantly tasted of lemon, herbs, garlic and olive oil and I only wish it was served in a Tajine, which would have been a great visual treat. This is one dish, if you were asked to choose only one from the menu, you should order. Dining at Zizo is a wonderful experience for the food and enthusiastic staff. Try this restaurant, if you want a different dining experience.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Gunjan Hans,"Rated I simply love the food at Zizo. It's my go to place for Lebanese.. And I want nothing more.. Just their hummus and pita is sufficient to satiate my craving for Lebanese food! Basil hummus is their special. A must try! And spicy hummus is just tooo good!! The pitas are served freshly baked, just out pf the oven, hot and fluffy - simply delicious. The mezze platter I wouldn't recommend cz it had just two items which were non veg, rest were all veg so it was a downer. Rather you order a dish of kebabs or something. We had falafel.. That was good... They were sweet enough to serve us extra spicy hummus when we requested. We even had the dessert - forgotten the name - it was a custard roll sorts. I liked it. It was typical Lebanese flavors - rose, elaichi and pistachio. Not something I'd eat every day. But something I wouldn't mind having after a full course Lebanese meal.",Rated 4.5,47,390,??

Nikita Serrao,"Rated Was my first visit here, and I'll say I wasn't really pleased. Look and feel wise they place does a pleasant job. It's nice to sit, chat and hangout over coffee. But, the food, I can assure you I've had better chicken wings (also ones that didn't look like chicken lollipops) the sauce was a bit off. The batata dish was also something you'd eat at home and not go all the way for. And lastly, the crispy cheese rolls were just spring rolls with cheese filled in them. The only thing I enjoyed here was the Belgian chocolate shake and that's about it. I don't think I'm ever going back!",Rated 3.0,9,103,??
Hero And The Sage,"Rated Zizo is a restaurant serving delectable almost authentic lebanese cuisine. It is located in K block, Cp and isn't too hard to spot but is not one of the better locations. The ambience of the place screams arabic. There is an Arabic feel to the interiors and even the music playing has an arabic air to it. There are walls with jars of spices which the middle east is known for. The beautiful lamps add to the whole arabic vibe they successfully created. Coming to food, I ordered myself, 1. Penne arabiata with lebanese twist: It was a good flavourful pasta which was slightly spicier because of the lebanese twist that they add. 2. Falafel cheese burger: this burger had a flavourful taste of pickles. The humus was made to perfection and this burger no doubt was different from what we usually eat. 3. Strawberry lemonade: This turned out to be one good blend of two strong flavours. One not overpowering the other but making its own mark on your tastebuds. 4. Beirut harma street: This fizzy drink had a blast of flavours which turned out to be very refreshing. It was sweet, sour and fizzy and all of these elements are balanced well. The cost for two is anywhere close to Rs.1300-1500. They serve alcohol and sheesha as well which is a plus. Despite that, the place wasn't crowded at all. I wouldn't hesitate visiting again whenever I'm looking for a good lebanese restaurant.",Rated 4.0,9,43,??
Kumkum Jha,Rated Everything was perfect in this restaurant : It seemed like one of those restaurants that have opened up to let its customers enjoy the true lebanese mediterranean delights. The attendants were very friendly although some of the new ones didnt know much about the menu being served. Turns out that the owner is based in Middle East and has managed to bring in a Lebanese chef all the way from Lebanon : which explains such authenticity in their food. and Please try their Mojito : They are out of the world.,Rated 5.0,1,5,??

Nikhil Adhlakha,"Rated Zizo is a good place with near authentic lebanese preparations. I ordered the chicken balls stuffed with mutton but on server's recommendation, went for th platter. Not a big one but it was a mistake. I do not remember the name f dishes but the chicken mutton balls and a bread topped with minced mutton were awesome. the hummus - absolutely great. the dip - very nice. rest of the mezze platter was a 2/5 considering the fact that the only taste i got in those items was the bread. I also ordered 2 rolls and both were fantastic with pickles and dip. I couldnt resist the humus and ate the whole bowl myself. Lastly, I had alo ordered turkish coffee, expecting it to be something different, which it was but not that much. It can be avoided. Now because of my certain apprehensions, they also served me free dessert - some semolina cake. different, good and heavy. would need 2 people to finish that one after the platter and rolls. So Ambience - 4.5/5 Service - 3.5/5 Food - 4/5 Pricing - 4.5/5 Overall - 4/5 - and that too because a recommended dish didnt turn out to be great. otherwise I would have given a 4.5",Rated 4.0,22,172,??

DrPooja Passi,"Rated I will keep it short and honest. I don't know how the place has got 4 overall rating, it's definitely not more than 2. The ambience is so so, nothing mediterranean...not even the music!! There is this dark smoky closed area for the Friday night belly dance nights, which I guess would be the only thing to excite someone enough to come here as the food definitely is nothing to write about. We had 2 starters, the mutton kofta roll and kibbe. While the kibbe portion was small (4 pieces only) it made up on good taste, as for the roll, well just plain mediocre especially with its tepid temperature. Moving to main course, jeez..plain BAD. The lamb rack was bad, with the worst sauce/gravy (bland and badly brown grey in color) and too much bland rice; the palate was saved by another part of the dish which is fresh curd. The other item was Tajine Chicken...eek again as it was served on badly cooked cabbage and broccoli. Though the chicken was well cooked, there was just no taste to it...saving grace on this dish was the side of couscous. The only star item in the entire menu would be their HUMMUS. We also ordered the Ginger ale n coke drink and we are glad we did as it was the thing with which we could gulp down the over priced tasteless food. My concluding suggestion, just stick with the rolls n kebabs.",Rated 2.0,5,16,??
Kumar Saurabh,Rated Wow!! this was one of a very few places that really served food that was nostalgic and close to heart. Tried the hummus ras asfou a and lamb manoushe it was fresh with a wide selection of herbs and it was mildly spicy and on the side it was served with pickled veggies and freshly made mayonnaise.

SincerelyKangna,"Rated Lebanese is my new found interest in food, and I have been looking for some place where I could binge over some authentic stuff. And while aimless wandering through CP, I found this eatery. Such a happy find. :) Ambience is quirky, menu is well crafted, food portion is just wholesome. One must look out for: Mezze platter, crispy cheese balls, chick'n cheese man'oushe and huge collection in rolls and kebabs. A little fusion has been done with Desserts like cheese kunafa and baked halawa cheesecake. This place is surely different from other fusion cum pubs in CP and around, visit this place for a different experience and you might get surprised with great food.

Ekta Marwaha,"Rated Delhi, you really need to know Lebanese food before you head to Zizo. Not the most visible restaurant or a preferred option in CP, this lesser known dinner serves food to its near authentic taste. The ambiance is pleasant, sadly there wasn't any backdrop music but the food more than makes up for everything. The mezze platters, both the cold and the warm one, are presented beautifully and have a generous amount of serving, good enough for a group of 3-4 people. The humus is undoubtedly the best I've tasted. Not the Indianised version, and the fattoush, zaatar, absolutely delightful. We also tried the Batata Harra (perfectly cooked potatoes, crisp outside and moist inside, just the right amount with a dash of spice); it's great to see so much of vegetarian fair on the menu. The chicken kibbeh and garlic sauce are also a must try. This is probably the first review where am absolutely raving about the food. The service, can be pulled up a notch, the bar too has scope for improvement, but I do hope the food remains. Also, what I particularly enjoyed was the cup of orange blossom 'white coffee' absolutely refreshing and a great way to end the meal.",Rated 4.5,16,51,??

Situated in k block opposite to pvr plaza, it is easily accessible and has lovely interiors. Be it a casual outing with friends or dine out with family it has got the perfect ambience. I tried falafel wrap, fattoush salad and fresh fruit halawoi smoothie. Fattoush salad was top notch, gotta say loved it. Falafel wrap was heavy. It was also good. Smoothie was different, unlike any smoothie i drank till then. It was good too. Overall totally content with the food quality. I liked the food and ambience this much but still rating them 3.5 cuz if their disgusting service.

Parija Chandra,"Rated Had seen good reviews of this place on zomato so decided to check it out. It's a cute, unpretentious, cozy little place and I absolutely loved the menu design. It was a pleasant surprise to find an authentic Lebanese/Moroccan place with an extensive menu extending way beyond the ubiquitous mezze platters and wraps. Among the two of us we shared a fattoush salad, a spicy tomato and Zattaar man'oushe and a chicken Moroccan tajine. We realised this was too much for two people as they serve generous portions. The fattoush salad is our staple Lebanese favorite and we were not disappointed. The spicy tomato Zattaar man'oushe had a bit of a bitter aftertaste, which it is supposed to have , though since I'm not a fan I tried it with the cucumber dip and loved the combination. The highlight of the meal was the Moroccan tajine , a first for me, tenderly cooked mildly spiced chicken served with slow cooked vegetables and melt in the mouth cous cous. The flavours were subtle and oh so good , with a homemade feel. For dessert we had the cheese kunafa, which seemed to be made of semolina, and served warm was very enjoyable on the cold winter day. At the end of our meal the amicable Lebanese owner came to us for feedback, pointing to the Lebanese wood fired oven and hygenic live kitchen assuring us of authenticity and the quality. The staff was also pleasant and courteous. Highly recommend the place to authentic Mediterranean cuisine lovers.",Rated 4.5,7,99,??
Pragya Verma,"Rated I haven't had a lot of Lebanese food before and I order only veg for myself so I hold lesser credibility in reviewing this place. Nevertheless, I'm going to rate my experience here. We landed at Zizo after hunting for a restaurant above 4 in CP on Zomato. Easy to locate, we found an interesting poster near the entrance for their Belly Dance which happens every Friday Night. Their seating is divided in three. The upper level has two sides, one dedicated for Sheesha lovers. The area is quite small but not compact. We ordered a Hot Mezze Platter in which the veg portions were fairly tasty. The dips were very good too and accompanied the snacks perfectly. We ordered 2 Sangrias and foul modammas with chilli oil. Didn't quite enjoy the fava beans. We were tempted to try the desserts so we ordered a Cheese Kunafa which was delicious and very different and looked richer than it picture in the menu. The ambiance did justice to the theme and so did the music.",Rated 3.5,13,435,??

Akshay Gulati,"Rated Great place to be. This is the best place to be in Cp if you are looking for a very cozy & not so crowded restaurant. The food is just awesome, service is a bit lacklustre, i had to get up and ask for someone to hand over the menu, post that it was great. Ordered a mezze with pita bread, a beer a smoothie and bourbosa as a dessert. Must say the food is authentic Lebanese. About the price, its easy on the pocket. The Mediterranean music in the background adds to the flavour. Must visit again.",Rated 4.0,33,51,??

Srishti,"Rated Zizo serves A1 Lebanese cuisine. Set in Connaught place , this restaurant is perfect to enjoy your lunch with friends. Combined with decent ambiance this place has got a unique flavour. However only thing to worry about is the way they charge tax. There are 5 types I.e service charge, swach bharat charge, vat, aerated tax, and service tax. This is rather unflattering and they should avoid imposing some of the unnecessary charge.",Rated 4.0,55,37,??

Service needs improvement, could not find my waiter nor did he care to check-up on me at any point. Finished off with nice Turkish coffee.",Rated 3.5,53,39,??

Alok Verma,"Rated In a city where restaurants are as sundry as its neighbourhood, theres never a deficit of places to dine in Delhi. From crude seasonal cooking to special juncture dinners, theres an eatery for every occasion on Connaught Place. First culinary travel jaunt to the nations capital implied researching a lot and chalking out a schedule by making certain only the most highly recommended eateries go on the slate. I had massive help from the Food Talk India group, which consists of majority of Delhiites and far too many Mumbaikars who have travelled to Delhi in the past. One of those advocated restaurants was the very first place we ate at on our first morning in Delhi: Zizo. Serving Lebanese food that has attained quite a buzz, Zizo opened a year ago on Connaught Place and its popularity is not unbeknownst to people living outside Delhi. What propelled us to try out the out-of-the-box Lebanese menu at Zizo was the fact that it was formulated by Chef Maroun Chedid, who was the recipient of the title Chef of the Year 2013 by the Tocques Blanches du Monde in Monaco. What you walk into and what clearly sets a great visual impression is the myriad of colourful pickled vegetable jars on multiple shelves behind which you spot the Chef working the wood fired oven. Middle Eastern food is a nexus of interlocking cultures. You can read the same words- tabbouleh, fattoush, hummus- from one nation to the other. However, in each, it is tenuously or sometimes, vastly different. Also, I love how in this cuisine, there is an emphasis on fresh herbs and vegetables. So a meal here wont make you feel like someone has tarmacked your gut. There is a variety of drinks to choose from. What caught my eye in the menu included Mulberry Lemonade, Hand-pressed mint lemonade, Fresh fruit Halawoi Smoothie, Beirut Harma Street, besides other combinations that are quite unheard of. We ordered a Lebanese Sunset (150) and Byblos Old Souk (150). The former consisted of mixed juices with sour mix poured over ice, floated with Gerandine. Byblos Old Souk had muddled lemons with ginger ale and coke. Both were the apt thirst quenchers to start the meal with. The server recommended their wings and Manoushe, which were exactly what we ordered next. Spicy Chicken Wings (320) essentially comprised of chicken lollipops with Zizos homemade chili sauce. The chicken was cooked to perfection and had a spicy and decadent marination full of acidic notes and with a chilli dip that was just the right amount of hot. I havent eaten a good Manoushe in India. Not really. So I was showing a little hesitation before ordering their Lamb Manoushe Lahm BiAjeen (360). This Lebanese meat pie served with spicy yogurt was impeccable, to say the least. The presence of pine nuts took the manoushe to a whole new level. The proportion of meat was not compromised on either. The base was light and crispy. All in all, a hearty first course. You know youre doing a good job when your customer closes his eyes and devours every bite by licking the spoon off the last morsel. Thats what the next of the three courses did to us. Grand moms chicken pasta (360) should become their gold standard. Nothing compares. The sassy spaghetti rolled around with a cheesy wine sauce marrying the tenderly cooked shredded chicken was a party in our mouths. Twisted Lamb Burger (420) was a combination of real robust flavours: hummus, all-spice, onion, tomatoes, sumac, all complimenting the grilled lamb patties and served with fresh buns. I did not have any room to try out the Labne Garden Roll (180), Breaded Shrimps with Harissa Sauce (450) and Oriental leg of lamb (690) which were yet again, highly recommended by a couple of foodies in Delhi that Id gotten in touch with, but theres always going to be a next time. Our final course consisted of Baked Halwa Cheesecake topped with seasonal berries coulis (260). The flavour was there, certainly. But the cheesecake was not light. It was quite dense and was almost off-putting. Cheese Kunafa (190) which is a Lebanese warm dessert with Orange Blossom Syrup and Basbousa (190) which is a traditional sweet coconut & semolina cake would be the top recommendations here. The place was a little empty the day we went there but it deserves to be full. They succeeded in celebrating the ebullience, the freshness, the deliciousness and the unbridled loveliness of Lebanese cuisine and we do need something like this in Mumbai.

Yash Satyawali,"Rated I was damn hungry this one particular day when I was roaming around C.P with friends that I found this great place called Zizo that serves the Lebanese and Mediterranean food. We thought of trying it once as nowadays, the foreign food tastes much better than the authentic Indian, especially for the non-vegetarians like me and my friends.(no offends meant, though). I found the ambience of this restaurant quite different and weird at first, but later I got the heck of it and enjoyed much more. The service here is average and sometimes we were really craving to get the food fast. I tried batata harra and falafel roll and I found it to be just okay. My friends ordered varieties of chicken like chicken wings, chicken shawarma rolls etc and they too found the taste to be about average. I found the prices also a bit on the higher side when compared to the other Lebanese restaurants. Though, not completely avoidable, it definitely needs some improvements for their tastes levels but otherwise it is worth visiting once.",Rated 3.0,3,45,??

On first glance this place looked small, hardly any tables on ground floor, but first floor seating is quite good. Ambience is something to brag about. The waiters were extremely co-operative, they helped us decide the menu as well. Service is very friendly. And the best part was food. Didn't expect to have such tasty food, all the veggies were so fresh. Breads were of supreme quality (probably the best I had in Delhi) and the sides perfectly complimented to give the dishes their unique taste. All in all, a very good experience. P.s. Only issue - They don't add cheese to the pizza unless you specify in advance, which you might miss in case you haven't looked at the menu twice.

Anil Misra,"Rated Eight of us, six adults and two kids visited the restaurant on November 26, 2015, Guru Nanak's birthday, for lunch. The restaurant was largely empty so seating wasn't a problem. The food was a mixed bag. Some items were excellent others weren't that good. The Hummus was excellent as was the Grilled Sea Bass. The kids loved the Sea Bass so we ordered two more. Of the two, one was excellent as before, while the other was uncooked in the middle so we sent it back. The Veg Pizza was excellent but the flat bread with herbs was a disappointment. The Veg Tagine was excellent but the potato pie wasn't good. The leg of lamb was a disappointment. When the bill came we found that the Sea Bass that had been sent back had been included in the bill. We protested and a little later a cook appeared to argue with us. He had a legal bent of mind. He didn't claim that the Sea Bass was properly cooked. His objection was that we should have sent back the dish immediately without eating any part of it. Our problem was that the fish was under cooked in the middle (clearly taken out of the freezer in a hurry and not allowed to thaw) and we had to reach the middle in order to find that out. We then agreed to pay the bill and report the incident on Zomato. This is the first time that I have threatened anybody with a website as also the first time that I have been slanged by a cook. The mention of Zomato had effect. The cook called off the slanging and a revised bill with one Sea Bass taken off was presented. All in all I would give a 3.5 for the food and 1 for the service. Even before the cook incident the waiter had generally worn a distracted air: he clearly wanted to be elsewhere. Since a dining experience includes food and service the overall rating is 2.5.",Rated 2.5,2,1,??

The interiors, decor and seating are innovative and comfy. Non veg Mezzo Platter is my personal favorite and recommendation for the place.

Rightly cooked and was oozing with flavours. We tried their recommendation of Moroccan Tajine to experiment with our taste buds which turned out fine. But i won't recommend that if you aren't in a mood to really challenge your taste buds. Loved their food, drinks and hospitality. We ended it up with cheesecake and that too was soooooo goood.

For food I had offered - ' Hot Mezze Platter' & ' Penne Primavera & Feta cheese'. The taste was delectable.

So, I preferred not to sit there. The food was amazing. Not a even a single dish disappointed me. We had ordered Hummus Ras Asfour which was chicken and hummus basically served with bread. This was the best dish of the evening. A must try. Loved it! Cheese Manouche which was plain cheese flat bread pizza. It was bland in taste, just what we had wanted. Penne Arabiata with Lebanese twist, nothing like the usual arabiata pasta, much better in fact, the Lebanese twist made it delicious. Yummmmy it was! Minty Melon Lemonade was vodka based cocktail.

The place has got a beautiful ambience, the ground floor is a little lighted while the first floor is a little on the darker side. They've got a separate smoking area. The service is good. Ordered a Grand mom's White Sauce Chicken Spagetti, this one has become my new favorite. It's really cheesy, the presentation on the top looks really simple, more like a lasagne but on the inside it's a chicken layer on top with spaghetti inside at the bottom! It's quite heavy and the serving is also big, so could definitely serve two. Next were Chicken tawf Shawarmas, they are perfect taste so as to the Mediterranean Shawarmas, light on the spices and more of the flavour, with feta cheese. Falafel Cheese Burger was next, this burger is quite unlike any other. The tikki of the burger has falafel filling with cheese in the centre so when you cut through the centre there's a ton load of cheese coming through. Definitely yum!! Belgium Chocolate shake and LIIT were the drinks ordered, the LIIT was quite nice, but could be a little stronger. Definitely recommended and will surely comeback to try more stuff on the menu. One piece of advise, there's not much in store for a Vegetarian, so on that note, you just might have to really scratch your head as hardly 2 Choices are there under each course.

MOVISH,"Rated Zizo is ideally located bang opposite PVR Plaza in CP ,in the heart of Delhi,in a very busy business n tourist hub.Zizo has a cool n refreshing AMBIENCE, pretty even. It has ample seating ,spread into 3 different sections ,one on the ground floor n two on the first floor where one section is dedicated to Sheesha lovers n belly dance performances. The PRICE POINTS are competitive,at par with any other place in the vicinity. Run by a Lebanese person, with a Lebanese chef,the FOOD here is as authentic as you could possibly get inside Delhi.The SERVICE can leave you with no complaints And yet,I felt that Zizo has not gotten its due,its grossly underrated.Why?My guess is that it's marketing machinery has not done a great job. Secondly, the hospitality factor has to be taken up a notch by the service staff so that one not only gets efficient service but experiences the famed Lebanese warmth as well. We ordered Crispy Cheese Rolls ,a Veg n Cheese Man'oush n Veg Falafel Roll.Everything was fresh n delicious n very flavorful. Only the Cheese Rolls would taste better with a bit of seasoning,they were a bit bland.The Falafel had the perfect taste n texture n the man'oush-a Lebanese flat bread with toppings, is a must have;You might never favor a pizza again.I did not like the Summer Breeze (mocktail)at all,the only blemish on an otherwise spot on meal.It was the Sangrias which won us over.We ordered one with orange accents first n it had a burst of flavors-a good quality merlot,orange n diced fruit.Then we asked for one with strawberry crush n it was a clear winner.Do not miss if you love a full bodied Sangria.To round off we ordered a Cheese Kunafa- a dessert with a thick filling of Lebanese cheese sandwiched between crumbly semolina n flour layers n served warm .Not very sweet,it delights you with its smooth unique taste.Must try.The two of us felt full after consuming so much that we had to get the dessert packed,yet we didn't feel heavy or bloated at all-it says a lot about the ""healthy n light"" cooking practices followed here.That's one more feather in Zizo s cap.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Kuldeep Singh,"Rated Went to this place after reading good reviews on TA. Ambience is pleasant with better seating upstairs. We ordered the Fattoush salad (which had heaps of vinagrette in it as well as salt making it unpalatable after a while), traditional hommous (which was good), a mixed grill (which was OK with the meat kebab being undercooked with red colour meat visible when u cut the kebab- this is replaced a another new kebab - properly how it should be made type was offered which was again OK) and a hot mezze platter (in which we asked them to replace the cheese rolls and veggie with cheese by 4 falafels - which were very good) I think its better to order veggie stuff here. We also had a bottle of water with one virgin mojito (which was good) and one pinacolada On the bill, I was surprised to see a lot of charges which looked fuzzy as the VAT (as we all know) is supposed to be charged on 40% of the TOTAL bill; this was not the case. they charged it on the total amount. And another 10% for service charge (which is another slew tax on everyone as tips are for GOOD service only - but this is levied by most restaurants nowadays) And the other charges too probably need clarification from the restaurant. I would probably want to tell all the restaurants- Do not cheat people! guys we are here to have fun! Remember, gone are the days when you could pass on anything and people did not speak up. Change .... Not for me again!",Rated 2.5,24,35,??
Prarthna,"Rated This place had been on my list since long, so I went here to try their lebanese cuisine. AMBIANCE- It is lovely, like those classy english cafes. They have different areas for sitting, each of them very vibrant and very unique. FOOD- The food gave me no chance to complain about. We ordered spicy hummus with pita bread and veg falafel rolls. I've tried hummus and pita at several other places, but this was probably the best of them all. The pita bread was quite soft yet stuffing. I also tried the strawberry lemonade which had just the right taste. It wasn't too sweet as I had feared, rather it was very refreshing. SERVICE- Service was fine too. I don't have any complaint but I did not experience their 'much talked about hospitality' that I read in various reviews on zomato. VALUE FOR MONEY- The above food cost us around 850 bucks, hence quite reasonable. Overall, a good place to visit once.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Jeanbert Stanislaus,"Rated Was in search for something new, so find out this outlet which is famous for its lebonese cuisine. It was my first time i was trying lebonese dishes, It is located in outer circle near Nirula's, It was a weekday when i went, so was not crowded, the ground floor of the outlet is well lit and bright and the 2nd floor has dim low lights. The Ambiance here was good, Soothing music was playing, i just loved the music, i think it was in lebonese. the staff was less due to less crowd but still they managed quite nicely. We ordered Spicy Hummus(they must be for lebonese lovers, i didn't like it much, but the pita bread which was served with it was good), Grilled Chicken Kebabs(it was amazing and had a different taste which i think was made in lebonese style), and in mocktails we ordered watermelon passion fruit juice and Mulberry Fusion. I must say the mocktails was very good. For Non Alcoholics do try their mocktails. All in all Nice food and Nice Soothing Music makes it a good place to visit. Highly recommended for Lebonese Cuisine Lovers and for those who love to try New Cuisines. Cheers !",Rated 4.0,16,69,??

This place has authentic lebanese food to offer, which definitely gives a tough competition to any other cuisine being served around. A beautiful cosy place to sit and relax, it has three sections to sit, choose what bests suits your comfort. The place is value for money as the portions are big and filling. Visit the place for a quiet time and some great food, which will take you to lebanon right in the center of Delhi. Not to forget mention of the creative way of presenting the bill in a Tarboush (a red lebanese hat) shaped box. Look forward to many more such experiences.

The place is tastefully done with different kinds of seating arrangements. We were smilingly shown our place to sit. The menu has decent options. But it also has few options of pastas and pizzas. I felt these were there to cater to a wider audience. We ordered a foul moudamme, a veggie and cheese pizza and watermelon delight. The first item was essentially rotis and a sauce made up of ground rajma. It tasted superb. The pizza was also very fresh and good. No fancy toppings - just fresh tomato and green peppers. Freshness of the base and ingredients did the trick. Watermelon delight too was refreshing. Overall all, the place ticked all the boxes. And prices aren't too steep.

Raj K Sekhar,"Rated I expected to find a place that had extensive decoration and highlighted ambience with dim lighting. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The place actually looks like an Ice Cream Parlour. The first time I was here, I was utterly disappointed. Their menu was so scanty, it couldn't have crossed 15 items in total! The food was brilliant though, but due to the lack of options we just whetted our palate here and headed elsewhere. It cost us a bomb for that minimal dining itself. Problem wasn't the pricing; it was the quantity to be frank. A person won't be ordering multiple items and feel unfulfilled time and again. I was skeptical to step in here again after a friend had been coaxing me to return, to which I frankly stated the lack of items on their menu and minimal quantity. Well, I was in for a surprise as their menu had expanded beyond imagination! The melee of items that were available was simply magnificent. They had outdone themselves, and probably many other restaurants in the city. And the specificity is the scintillating taste they still managed to provide. Hadn't been satisfied this deeply by a gastronomic experience for a long time now. Portion size was almost the same, but hey, with the new listing that hardly mattered.Did I mention that their menu itself is beautifully designed?

I've been to this place about 4 times and everytime left the place with the happy smile and a satisfied stomach. The food is really good and the staff is courteous. The best part about this place is the intrinsic detailing done in the decor. I was in awe of the small art pieces giving an Arabic aura to the restaurant. I recently tried their coffee too, which was ah-mazing! It's been ages since I had cappuccino dabbed with a hint of drinking chocolate and coupled with the option of sugar cubes! *nomnomnom* to the days when I gulped these down as a kid at every resort getaway trip I was a part of, haha! Their chicken shawarma is to die for and the stellar dish has to be hummus ras asfour. If you have a big appetite do try out their platters, as they're pretty good too!

Charu Jagga,"Rated Well, as I have been on an expedition of tasting the most authentic and tasty Lebanese and Mediterranean food available in the vicinity of my place, I found this really cool place situated in C.P called Zizo. Well, it can be said that it is living up to its promises, they have sworn for providing you the most yummy and fantastic Lebanese and Mediterranean food. The ambience of the place is equally appealing as the cutlery of the hotel resembles that of a Mediterranean one. You get the feel of sitting at a Lebanese restaurant. For the starters, I ordered batata harra, it may sound weird by the name, but tastes quite good. My husband ordered chicken wings for himself but found it quite average. For drinks, we ordered strawberry lemonade and it was quite good as well. For the main course, we ordered grilled lamb koftas and grilled tauok rolls and they were quite different in taste and it took us a little time to get used to it. The restaurant also gets good marks in terms of the price it demands. It was quite high to be honest as we had to shell out a couple of grand but it was well worth of it. I suggest you to surely visit it once and have the great experience of having the Lebanese and Mediterranean food fare.",Rated 3.5,19,157,??

As I was craving for the Lebanese food again big time, I found this superb and amazing restaurant that serves what my taste buds demands when I am craving for some Lebanese bites. So, I have been to this restaurant at Connaught place which can be easily be located once you enter C.P. I thank my stars that I got the opportunity to visit this fantastic restaurant. I especially liked the ambience of it. As soon as I entered the area, it gave me a Lebanese feel. I ordered at first the grilled lamb koftas and the spicy hummus to feed my hunger pangs and it served its purpose in the most yummy way and I could simply not believe to get such an authentic Lebanese food in India. Also, the chicken shawarma rolls here are to die for. I also particularly liked the color coordinated uniforms of the service attendants which I found really fancy for the eyes. The pricing part is also an added asset of this restaurant as I can guarantee that you will not find such authentic Lebanese and Mediterranean food at such an affordable price point, which is nothing, but just approximately 750 per person. Well, its worth a price getting a fantastic foreign taste sitting here only. Take my word and visit Zizo for the most amazing Lebanese dining experience possible.",Rated 4.5,20,183,??

It was served with chilli sauce and a garlic dip. And sigh, the garlic dip, it was amazing, so light and yummy! Went on to order the falafel wrap and again, no complaint! The mulberry juice and Beirut Harma street (mocktail) were also really nice. For desserts we ordered the cheese kunafa and baked halawa cheesecake.

Well to start with ,meet and greet by the staff is very nyc..when I was ordering the food staff helped me out with wat I could try according to my taste buds...well in all impressive service.. Now what I ordered is as follows:- 1. Chicken shawrma- well whenever I go to a lebeneese restaurant I do try their chicken shawrma. There shawrma was very healthy,fresh and delicious. Chicken was fresh perfectly grilled. shawrma was served with garlic sauce and pickles. It was quite a meal.I would say itz very gud bt not the best I ve had. I think they should serve hummus dip as well with the shawrma. 2.Hummus Ras Asfour- well our attendant recommended this dish to us and he proudly said this is our signature dish. I must say after having a first bite this dish made my day. Walla amazing hummus chicken tendered to its mark..great texture with lip smacking flavours..I think this is THE signature dish and one of the best these guys serve..I infact used my fingers to complete.. Sorry couldn't control..oops... 3.penne pasta in red sauce with zatar- well I would say this dish was quite average. The texture was nt that great,I did,nt get any flavours of zatar- rather it was all tangy,so I won't recommend it. In all n all I believe it was a great experience and I would say u shud try lebeneese food at this outlet cuz dats wat they are really good at.

My friend wanted to have a Cappuccino, but they did not have it, so he ordered the Turkish coffee instead, which he did not like much. In terms of food, I had little to complain about. We ordered the Cheese Rolls and Batata Harra for starters. The Batata Harra, a dish of diced potatoes impressed me with its newness-- a welcome break from the usual potato wedges and french fries. The main course did not please me as much. The Penne Primavera with Feta Cheese wasn't as good as I had expected it to be, but the Potato Pot Pie was all right. The service was also somewhat tardy.

Fattoush Salad - It was fresh & crunchy and I loved the sumac & pomegranate dressing. 4/5 for that. Lentil Tabbouli- made perfectly, tasted awesome - 4/5 for that Crispy Cheese Rolls - Though the cigar rolls were crispy, there is a scope of improvement. The cheese lacked flavour. Can be improved. The homemade chilli sauce which was served along with it was good. 3/5 for that Twisted Lamb Burger - The lamb patty was excellent. It was juicy and perfectly blended with Lebanese spices. A great combination with hummus as a spread. 4/5 for that. Grand Mom Chicken Pasta - This was a dish and am sure all pasta lovers will like it. Tasted very homemade, truly a grandma's recipe, served baked in a casserole. Really loved it :-) 4/5 for that. Lady's Arm - This was the show stopper!!! The sweetened puff pastry filled with custard...yummy! Well done chef! 5/5 on that. Just loved all the preparations. You can make out that the chef at Zizo knows what he is doing and takes a lot of care about the food that comes out of the kitchen. Reasonably priced menu which doesn't burn holes in your pocket.

Gaurav Sethi,"Rated Not to authentic Lebanese Cuisine. Courteous Waiters. Quick service. Pay 30% EXTRA On TAXES & VAT. - Because they Levy wrong % of taxes & vat & they will calculate the percentages Wrong TOO, just to increase the bill amount. I went on my anniversary with family , I was so annoyed on the wrong calculation of % in the bill. I even raised it to the manager , who angrily said : Pay as much as you want , OR dont pay any at all. I was actually dumbstruck on his such a low grade reaction to his customer. And after shouting out the manager actually ran inside the kitchen . For once I thought he has gone to pick up a knife to kill me. RIDICULOUS. I wish to get this bill checked with respect to the vat & taxes applied. ATTACHED For eg: 1. Aerated VAT 20% should only be applied to the aerated drinks(2 cokes in this case) costing 180 Rs total = 20% x 180 = 36Rs. However in the bill it charges 39.60 Rs. 2. Similarly w.r.t to the service tax %. Recent Notice from 'Delhi High court Bar association' states that the service tax can only be levied onto the service charges.

Punit Gandhi,"Rated Felt like Lebanese food and unfortunately, Delhi seems to have very very few authentic places Found this little gem of a restaurant in CP on zomato Being a Monday night had no problems getting a table. The restaurant is in 2 parts that i could see, you have the downstairs area with tables and the big oven for the Manoushe. An upstairs area again with tables and an area to the side of it, with low tables and sitting on small bean bag type stools. This is where we sat for the night They also serve hukka here which was a big plus for us We started our meal with some Hummus Ras Asfour, which is hummus topped with tangy marinated chicken. Delightful! The consistency of the hummus and the counter balance of the tangy chicken was just perfect. I'd also like to mention that this place serves authentic Pita and not the shit that you get in India usually This was accompanied by some Provencale Chicken Wings, again tangy and so well marinated. It's anything unlike any chicken wings you have had before, be it here or abroad Next we had 2 of their Man'oushe the Lamb man'oushe and the Chicken & Cheese man'oushe For those expecting something like a pizza after looking at the pics of a man'oushe, don't. This is so different, and dare i say, better than any pizza i have had in India. The lamb mince was beautiful with the pine nuts on top. The chicken was succulent with a bit of zing in the red sauce and cheese At this time, we were quite full and decided to just have some plain mutton kebabs. Succulent and juicy in every bite!! To finish off, we had the Lady Arms, flaky pastry rolls with a filling of sweet cheese.

Netra Agarwal,"Rated Situated in the heart of the capital, it's hard not to be impressed by Zizo. The interiors transport you to Lebanon itself; thanks to the aromatic interior of this eatery. Service is prompt, so much so that I'd like to oversee a chauvinistic comment made by the waiter who was serving us. While my friend (male) and I were arguing about what to order, he breezily intervened and said, 'guys usually say the right things always.' Nonetheless, after I gave him a 'look' he pretty much made up by quipping great service with a warm smile. He even returned enthusiastically to the table and enquired if we're having a great time or not. By then I certainly was having a great time thanks to the drinks that we were sipping on. Both mulberry juice and watermelon passion fruit juice were delicious. I almost gulped down my drink like a thirsty traveler in a desert. Next came the food. Fatoush salad: crisp, fresh and so lemony. Almost made my day. And grilled lamb kofta: the hummus was perfect, the roll so succulent and juicy. Yum!

Ground and first were quite casual but second was very different and dark. Ambience is nice and service is quick. You can just sit there on the comfortable sofas on bean bags for hours and chatter away. About food we ordered non veg mezze platter which was kind of a mixed bag. Lamb rolls were good but other stuff was average. Served with hummus and some chili dip it was of decent quantity for 2 people. Followed by this came mutton kofta roll which was quite yummy. They offer no happy hours by the way. Finally for dessert we had Ladies finger which was yummy and the coconut cake which was good and filling.

P S,"Rated Went here with a couple friends, mostly for Turkish coffee. The ambience was okay. The place is apparently divided into different sections - with the inner section looking way more Arabic and cosy - if you plan to have drinks and a hukkah. There were only a few people, being a Sunday afternoon. Turkish coffee - the main target - was delectable. Good roast, resulting in a lovely flavour. The cookies they serve alongside are sinful! We also ordered cafe blanca, which was a mixed surprise. You probably need the taste and aroma to grow on you before you actually like it. We went on to have some lunch - hummus fatt - DO NOT ORDER!!! - and falafel and rolled taouk and fattoush. Except the hummus, which barely had any hummus - just WHOLE boiled chickpeas, other food items were good. The menu misses quite a few Lebanese dishes though. Their mulberry and strawberry lemonades are pretty good. Service is fine, but the servers are a bit crude. Heard them abusing openly in the restaurant area more than once! And if you're planning to have some wine, don't rely on them knowing a bit about it! Indian religious music kept popping in once in a while too. They do have a belly dance night on Fridays which I've never checked. Place is good overall, with a few improvements that could be made. Hummus and the music definitely the ones needing attention. I'd probably go there for the Turkish coffee again!",Rated 3.0,18,29,??

The best i liked about the place is the HOOKAAH... Well done sheesha .. Black magic hookah is a must try ... Watermelon mocktail is also very tasty.. Appreciable staff ...

Half Thalli Full,"Rated Every once in a while the craving for eating good Lebanese takes over. Unfortunately we don't have a favourite Lebanese restaurant that is good enough to turn to, every time we feel like having Lebanese. So the search for a place that serves great Lebanese took us to Zizo in CP. The restaurant is very easy to find and conveniently located, finding a parking close by can be a task. If you can't spot it, then weirdly enough, you have to look for a massive poster of a girl belly dancing. The decor is airy and pleasant, with the customary intricate lamps being the only thing used to give it a middle eastern feel. The service was nice and fast. With the staff always smiling and at hand. We ordered the following: 1) Chicken shawarma: generous portion of shawarma with flavourful chicken and fresh vegetables. The turshi or pickled vegetables in the shawarma were too sour and acidic and that pulled the dish down. 2) Mixed grill: was expecting this to be a platter but the portion was a bit disappointing. Also was surprised with the omission of hummus. Again the turshi was too acidic and spoilt the taste. The chicken shish taouk tasted great but was soft and succulent. Overall disappointing dish. Zizo offers decent food, good ambience and service. Unfortunately for me the search for a great Lebanese continues.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

We were seated in the lounge area, the decorations were amazing! Expecially the roof with the colourful sheets of cloth hanging with a big Lantern attached to them. The ambience was great, the waiters were really sweet. Food was really good even though we had ordered just two dishes, the garlic sauce blew my mind away! I'd give zizo two thumbs up for the food. Ordered a strawberry lemonade alongside which wasn't too good, I'd like a stronger flavour of strawberry in the lemonade instead of a mild one! Dessert was sad, the amount of Nutella was really less and hence the overall dessert tasted bland. This was my first visit to Zizo, I'd definitely come here again for some good Lebanese food!",Rated 4.0,4,83,??
Anuja Chivate,"Rated Best Lebanese food in the town. Spicy hummus was finger licking good, and pita bread , so warm and fresh. Best pita breads are here in the town. However Zaatar Manoush did not appeal much to my taste buds, it was more a pizza topped up with carom seeds (ajwain in hindi), so some may like it, some may not. But overall, food is great.

Arvind Narasimhan,"Rated I am giving a one just because that's the minimal score. Else it's one big fat zero. Let's me start sequentially, we ordered a mezze platter, the pita bread n falafel were way below par. To change the taste, we ordered one potato starter, which was just barely average. Then followed it with a cheese roll kind of a starter. The cheese roll was way way below average n God knows what kind of below par cheese was used there. The icing on the cake was a pizza kinda starter which basically was pizza base with sliced onions n tomatoes with chat masala. Reminded me of masala papad. When it took 2 beers to gulp it down. So to end, we thought the potatoes were ok, let's order them back. But the chef had other ideas. This time, he ensured that they sucked too. Couldn't finish it too. The ambience n music sucked which was surprising as this place had rating of 4.2 on zomato.

Vivek Raveendran,"Rated This was my first time trying lebanese food.. And zizo did not disappoint.. A small little restaurant in Connaught place outer circle, this place would surely need to increase its seating capacity as its food and service is sure to attract more n more customers. The drinks were quite nice, especially the mulberry juice. We started off wit a batata harra which is basically crispy potato cubes and a hot mezze platter.. The potatoes were splendidly cooked and very soft on d palate. Mezze platter was a mix of different veg n non starters and it disappeared in no time. We followed it up wit a chicken shawarma rolls and lamb kafta rolls.. The lamb was juicy n succulent just as it shud b. It was also nice to observe that due attention has been given not just to d main dish, but to d side dishes as well. The hummus n salads were an ideal foil to the dishes. The star attraction for me though was the chick n cheese manouche which is basically a form of pizza lebanese style. It was a delight watching it being brought to us straight from the traditional oven. And it lived up to its billing .. The bread was ultra soft n thin and the chicken was well cooked. Chicken spaghetti also was really good. The only dampener was d tomato sauce penne pasta which I felt had a slight overload of tanginess. All in all a very good experience though",Rated 4.0,46,191,??
Rajiv,"Rated We (me and my 4 friends) followed Zomato to try something different and Vegetarian (only) on a Thursday (9 Jul) evening in CP. We zeroed in on this place, rated very high (4.2) on Zomato. So, there we were, at Zizo, bang opposite Plaza. Ambiance was OK sorts. No restaurant in CP can survive if the ambiance is not at acceptable levels. We were greeted and asked to proceed to first floor for a table for 5. And surprisingly, the tables there had a capacity to only seat 4 people. So we came to ground floor and joined 2 tables to sit comfortably. The place was relatively empty, being a week day and nearing 10 in evening (if I can call it a evening). The waiters there should have an idea of how and where 5 people can be seated in a restaurant..... Service: Was OK. No unexpected delays as such. The waiter who served us had a voice as if ws having a bad throat and it was difficult for all of us to make out what he said about the dishes. Was not well informed about the cuisines. Waiters (knowledge, body language, attitude, style....) and service at Calefornia Boulevard are a lot better than many in the town. Food: SNACKS: 1) Lebanese Garden Salad - Didnt like it as the vinegar was too pungent. It took out the taste out of it. 2) Fatte - They call it Delhi ke Dahi Bhalle. I would say... similar to Dahi Bhalle but served warm. So it takes time to relish the taste, if you have those taste buds. My suggestion.... Avoid this dish. 3) Mezze Platter - 2 pieces of Falafel, with Salad, hummus, baba ganoush (if i recall correctly), oickles, and another dip. accompanied by 2 Pita breads. Pita breads were more like Indian home made chapatis, but on a thicker side. Pita breads that I have had at other Lebanese restaurants (in India, USA) are different. It tasted fine. 4) Batata Harra - In layman's language... fried potatoes, similar to the ones we see that hawker selling under a metro station, frying on a tawa and served with a chat masala. The difference here was that the pieces were a bit big and bland. 5) Crispy cheese rolls - 5 pieces of hollow cheese rolls served with a dip. Was good and we contemplated having another one. 6) Hand pressed mint Lemonade - Regular. No comments. Main Course: 7) Zattar Manoushe - Pizza. Some Lebanese herb was sprinkled and baked (oops roasted, burnt....) all over the Pizza. Had one of the worst tastes that we have had with the pizza's. We suspect that something went horribly wrong with this experiment on restaurant's part. Avoid. 8) Veggie and Cheese Manoush - Veggie and Cheese Pizza. Thin crust, pizza having a decent taste. Nothing much to complain or appreciate. 9) Falafel Roll - Good rolls. Liked it. As an after thought that we all had, the non-vegetarian dishes would have made more sense at this outlet. This comes when in the main course, the eatery had only 2 Veg dishes listed, and only one to offer. I would say, for vegetarians, this place does not has much to offer. Whatever little they had to offer, was just average in taste. If I happen to visit this place again, I might try the non vegetarian dishes to corroborate the Zomato Ratings. Billing - CREDIT CARD machine was not working and the waiter apologized twice for it. Had to cough up cash, which we all were lacking. Suggestions: 1) Get well informed and smart staff 2) Get that credit card machine working. At least inform the guests before taking any orders that credit card machine is non working.

Ishan Kapoor,"Rated glamourizerr ""Richa SIngh"" Fashion & Food Blogger So, it's been quite a while since I posted. Well, studies exams they just ate all my time.. But I can promise you that this blog post is worth all the wait (specially for foodies!). I recently Visited Zizo in hope of finding some authentic Lebanese deliciousness and lemme tell you Fellas I was more than impressed with what they had to offer.. So, Lets First introduce Zizo to you all, ZIZO is a fast casual restaurant that serves authentic Lebanese with a modern twist, Located in the Heart of Delhi (C.P). Zizo believes that ""Food is not rational. Food is culture, habit, craving and identity."" (trust me the moment your put foot in that restraint you can feel it yourself). The name Zizo itself is inspired by a tiny piece of Lebanese culture. Its a name that inspired happiness, fun, creativity and an innocent reverence for nature and Lebanese culture. The look and feel of the restaurant features a Mediterranean contemporary design with foundations in traditional Mouneh-like preparation, set in glass jars from the country kitchen. Through the quintessential Lebanese art and architecture, the experience transports you into the Zizoworld. I loved the combination of colours ,Style and culture which deflected the multi ethnic roots of the Lebanese society. Personally for me Ambience and the interior is as important as the food and I can happily give Zizo 9 out of 10 for their interiors (still theirs always scope for improvement: P Talking about Food now their Menu is a mix of healthy and tasty, authentic Lebanese Food. The thing that i loved the most about their menu is that at Zizo Lebanese food is prepared with a slight tangy Twist to suit our Indian Taste buds. So Its like a delightful combination of Lebanese and Indian culture with a perfect balance. Being a non-vegetarian and a chicken lover ,mostly dishes ordered were non veg. (guilty), but the good news for all vegans out their zizo have a lot to offer for the vegans too. So the Dishes we ordered were Traditional Hummus with Tahini + Spicy hummus + Basil mint Hummus + Spicy moutabal with Pita Breads, The Variety was fabulous and the basil mint hummus is something you cant miss guys. The Provenale Chicken wings (called Jawaneh) and Lebanese Green salad was delicious, the use of unique oil & species as well as their organic herbs and natural ingredients added an authentic Kick of flavor. This all was accompanied by their fresh mint lemonade which I must say was lovely. For Desserts ordered Chocolate cake with Halawa, well a dessert to fight for as it is so delicious that you just cant share it it was heavenly for me, lemme tell you halawa just took this desert to a next level ( and I also have a sweet tooth so you know why heavenly :P) & BasBousa, well truth to be told the name is what got me curious and I ordered this desert, Its like a Indian Milk cake but still the sauces were bit different it had a unique taste, people who like cheese cakes or milk cakes , they can find their new love in Basbousa. Yeah but for The Staff is warm welcoming and very attentive, excellent service. So if you want to try Lebanese delicacy you should surely try Zizo and trust me you will be in for a Great exotic experience. The Staff is warm welcoming and very attentive, excellent service. So if you want to try Lebanese delicacy you should surely try Zizo and trust me you will be in for a Great exotic experience. chocolate cake halawa won my heart. Well sheeshas lovers you will be glad to know that Zizo also have a range of Hukkas to offer and trust me its pretty good in comparison to other places in C.P with its unique blend of flavours. The Staff is warm welcoming and very attentive, excellent service. So if you want to try Lebanese delicacy you should surely try Zizo and trust me you will be in for a Great exotic experience. Its been said before, that when a person carries his tradition and willing to share his culture his newly adapted community, the vivid colours of his country and richness in those traditions brings out the best in all his endeavours, ZIZOS owners installed this philosophy splendidly with their Lebanese food secrets.

There was no trace of food or drinks for another 20 mins and then they informed us that the dish we ordered is not available - I mean how is that even possible.

To begin with, the place seemed to be under some sort of renovation and the air conditioning had us sweating in 10 minutes. The sofa was too low for comfort. And then the force d' attraction -the half donkey was nowhere to be seen! For food, the lebanese garden salad had too much vinegar and the veg tajine was ordinary with a capital O. The only thing that stood out was the hot pita bread fresh out of the oven and the hummus, which was refreshing and light. I really enjoy lebanese food and this place is credited with serving it the authentic way. So I won't write it off so soon. I intend to have another go at Calcutta Chromosome and may be at Zizo too!",Rated 3.0,9,17,??
Manu Malhotra,"Rated Had heard a lot about Zizo..visiting it set me thinking why? The ambience at the CP outlet is ok and nothing great. Had ordered a mezzo platter to start with, as the most identifiable item in Lebanese cuisine. The platter had just 2 falafels, 2 pita bread and three dips including humus. How can a Lebanese restaurant go bad on humus. It was tasteless and so were the other dips which were sour to the core. We ordered a Man'oushe ( a thin crust Lebanese version of pizza , which was decent. V pointed about the bad humus to the chef who had the courtesy to replace it with a better but still not upto the mark version. Overall low on taste and low on quantity. Imagine a mezze platter with just 2 falafels and a bowl of sour veggies for 550/-. A total rip off. Go to Zizo only if u wanna get happy high on the "" went to a Lebanese restaurant"" feel.",Rated 2.5,1,6,??
Maria Elena Michibata,Rated I used to frequent Zizo till the time I found a dead fly in my spicy hummus. The worst part was that I was halfway through with the dish when I found the dead creature. The shish tauk was good as usual. In the end when the server got the change I discovered that he had returned 100 Rupees less and when I apprised him about this error he just walked away smiling to himself without apologizing.

Vandana Mehra,"Rated A family gathering of seven persons decided to check out Zizo tonight ( 28 June) .. We got a table on the upper level which was fine. In a few minutes a few of us were uncomfortably warm.. True it's searing hot outside but still.. On checking we were told that ""oh sorry our air conditioning is not working since morning."" This was accompanied by profuse ""sorry's"". I asked that in that case we should have been informed before being seated so that we could make an informed choice, The order taker looked perplexed at that suggestion and said that we will do so next time!!! as the kids had already ordered a plate of Kebe we paid for that and moved out to a neighboring restaurant. As the bill was presented I told the order taker that I will be reporting this poor service. He said that I was unhappy I should not pay. My stand was that as we had consumed the Kebe I will definitely wanted to pay. And I did. Is any restaurant experience only about the food? With such high service/ tax should owners not be concerned about comfort?? Disappointing ... Will be a long while before I go back to check out the food.",Rated 2.5,11,28,??

Rustom,"Rated I recently wrote quite a scathing review on another restaurant in Delhi which professes to serve authentic Lebanese cuisine, but certainly doesn't, and I came away feeling very disappointed wondering whether I could actually find a decent Lebanese meal in the city. So, it was with a little trepidation I went here for lunch today hoping for a bit of redemption and happily I'm pleased to report that I didn't come away disappointed. Good level of service and attention from the staff, however, the place was only 30% occupied, coupled with a very satisfying array of food. Started with the provinciale chicken wings (aka. jawaneh) which were really delicious, followed by the mixed grill, which was ok. The toum (Lebanese garlic sauce) they served was excellent - usually a good yardstick for a Lebanese eatery. That was accompanied by their fresh mint lemonade, which I must say was absolutely lovely - well worth going for alone! There was a couple sat next to me who were eating a shwarma from the menu - they looked really good and might have to be sampled next time.

You can watch your fresh hot fluffy pita bread being made right in front of your eyes. The pita bread at Zizo is like no other I have tasted before. It melts into your mouth and does not stick to your palate. The hummus is a perfect match to the pita bread. My friends tried pasta. Initially I thought it was a stupid thing to do when there were rolls and pita bread with hummus on the menu, but once you taste the pasta at Zizo, you would forget about having pasta in most other places. The ambience is nice and the food is amazing. What else can you ask for!",Rated 4.5,4,104,??
Varun Madan Mohan,"Rated So we were in Delhi for the day and my friends and I thought we'd get some good Lebanese food. So we decided to come to this place. One of the first things any person who would come to a Lebanese restaurant would order is Hummus and that's EXACTLY what they didn't have. They had run out of hummus. I thought the world was coming to an end. How can a restaurant that serves middle eastern food NOT have hummus?! That threw us off real bad. The Mutabel was not bad. It had a good smoked flavour. The bread was satisfactory (As a kid from the middle east, I'm really critical about the Arabic food I get in India). And the waiters have weird costumes on. And by weird I mean really weird. Not kidding. This place would've received a higher rating if it wasn't for the Hummus depletion. Bon apptit.",Rated 2.5,2,26,??
Amit Gupta,"Rated A nice place to have Lebanese food. We had the Mezze platter and the batata hara to begin with, both of them being excellent dishes. Next we had the chicken shwarma which was completely different than what we have had till now. I guess we were really missing out on the real thing. The only reason for a 3.5 rating is because the cleanliness of the restaurant really needs some work. The table where we were seated wasnt cleaned properly and even after having it wiped once again it still had smudges all over. Also the floor was dirty and there were pieces of salad under the table next to us which was probably from a previous serving and which went unnoticed by the staff the entire time we were there. Given the kind of food they serve drippings on the table would be a common occurence and they should really be using some kind of a spray cleaner rather than just wiping the tables down with a damp cloth. Someone needs to train the cleaning staff to maintain proper cleanliness and hygiene.",Rated 3.5,25,231,??
Asha Jose,"Rated Lately I have been craving to try various cuisines and after my successful affairs with Pan-Asian, Mediterranean and South Indian Fusion, it was time to dance my way into Lebanon. What attracted me to Lebanese cuisine is the mouth wateringly delicious kibbeh I tried recently, along with my friends constant disapproval of shawarmas that are sold in the city (which according to him are not at all authentic and are basically just glorified minced meat rolls!! The way he reminisces about his good ol College Shawarma Days, have actually led to me having dreams about this Oh-So-Elusive magical Shawarma! The heights to which food affects me..man!) So when I decided to finally try out Zizo, I knew that if my friend likes their Shawarma, then it must be pretty fantastic. (And it was by the way) To start off, we tried their Strawberry lemonade, which as per the reviews, was supposed to be excellent. Sadly, it tasted Wrong! Perhaps it was the ratio of the strawberry to the lemon juice, but I can tell you that, neither could I taste the Strawberry, nor the lemon. Since the first thing I tried here, turned out to be less than good, I was skeptical to try other drinks. But my hopes were soon revived when the food arrived. We started with the Spicy falafel, a traditional Lebanese Must try. The funny thing is that I liked the sauce served with the falafel, more than the falafel itself! The pickled radishes were a nice touch, reminded me of kimchi. But the rest of the herbs served along with the dish, did not complement the falafel at all. They were just dropped onto the plate without any purpose. But you guys should still try out this dish. Its a 3.5/5 The dish that you simply should not miss out on, is the Spicy Hummus!! This dish is genius beyond compare. And that Pita bread..? Wow, soft, fluffy and the perfect match for the slightly tangy and spicy hummus. Beautiful indeed! Next up was the Chicken Shawarma. Will it be able to withstand the sharp scrutiny of the Shawarma Connoisseur sitting in front me? Hell Yeah it did. Both of us found it to be light, authentic and wonderfully balanced with the sour dip and pickled salad. So I can say that my experience with the food at Zizos is definitely a 4/5 , however the reason I am giving a 3.5 is because the whole experience was dampened due to their ineffective AC, which not just us, but another group also pointed out. It wasnt working on both floors and during lunchtime, the entire restaurant was quite stuffy. Even after repeatedly asking the staff to switch it on, they didnt and just pretended to have switched it on!! Like that was going to work!",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Anurag Pal,"Rated Finally..an amazing place which serves authentic lebanese cuisine.. Zizo is named after a little ladybug( written on the wall there).A small place and may feel crowded sometimes. 1.My all time favorite.. chicken shawarma which was really fresh,soury taste, chicken pieces covered with a bit of hummus and cream. Really tasty. Very light on the stomach. ( What most places sell is an Indian interpretation of shawarma, spicy and oily, but this is the authentic one) 2. Hummus chicken ras asfour..superb!! Right combination of flavours..and the hummus was really tasty, mix of chicken and cashew...authenthic labanese cuisine Plus u get fresh pita bread..i think this dish is a Must try!! 3. Kebab platter which was fine..nothing special Seekh kebab,some tikkas placed between two pitta breads plus some sauces. The kebabs are not like Indian ones ,spicy and masala wala..They are simple and a bit bland. 4. Straberry lemonade.. such an unique combo of flavours which blends perfectly Some people may not like it, as it has a unique sweet and sour taste. Overall a good place with a very informal enviroment. The food is very light and very healthy. A bit costly but the food is very fresh.",Rated 4.5,57,567,??
Gangesh Varma,"Rated A friend a mine wanted to experiment with something new and since he hadn't been exposed much to lebanese we went to zizo. An excellent decision in deed. The ambiance is really pleasant and has a fresh feeling. The oven is right in front and makes for a wonderful sight while dining! The menu is quite limited, not too many options but not too few either. I'm a vegetarian and I felt it had a good amount of veg options. So we ordered the veggie and cheese man'oushe and a lebanese potato pie. The idea was to try something not usually available in other places serving Mediterranean food. The man'oushe was good but it really didn't hit the spot. Felt a Lil too homely pizza type though I must say the flavour on the crust, cheese and seasoning was rather unique but I guess the combination of veggies felt a tad too ordinary. Maybe should try the cheese and zaatar one next time. The potato pie was a gamble we thought but it turned out to be great. It was accompanied by a gravy/sauce which really elevated the dish from good to great! Subtle flavours, perfect texture of the veggies in the pie blending in your mouth with buttery mashed potatoes... seemingly simple dish but a celebrating on the palate! Now my favourite part in the meal includes the pickles that accompany the dishes. Fantastic! The jars of pickles are for sale and I had half a mind to pick it up! The complimentary lavash and dip was a refreshing start while waiting for the order. I'm looking forward to going and trying out the more staple fare like the falafels and mezzes and desserts!",Rated 4.5,50,308,??
Bikram Bindra,"Rated Finally, a place that lets you dive deep into the ocean that is Lebanese food, look beyond the very clichd associations and help you appreciate very distinct flavours and textures . Each item on the menu is divine, and looks as beautiful as the menu itself. I have eaten here on multiple occasions, and while everything hit bull's eye for me, I do have my clear favourites which are the most recommendation worthy. Go for the Mezze platter if you are in a large group, otherwise make sure you do try any one of the varieties of Falafel on offer. The best I have had in town, this super crisp and chunky treat here will change your perception of this humble fried snack. For mains, you have to have the Manoushe- the Lebanese take on a thin crust pizza that is perfect comfort food- crisp, hot and cheesy with a touch of the traditional Zaatar spice. If you are feeling slightly more peckish, then my take would be the stellar Oriental Leg of Lamb- a hearty braised creation served on a bed of rice with all the extra dips and breads to make a complete meal out of it. I am yet to eat my way through the desserts section, but have sampled the baklava- and it is a sweet and nutty concoction that is perfect to end a great meal. I believe the menu has a few new additions- cannot wait to go again soon, and sample more in this delightfully eclectic and warm place.",Rated 5.0,113,483,??
Avantika Chopra,Rated I had heard a lot about this place so visited it on 31 may. It is a small cozy place with a fresh ambience. The music is soft and low making communication easy. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. For drinks we ordered Hand pressed mint lemonade and watermelon passion fruit juice. The lemonade was well prepared and tasted fine whereas the watermelon fruit juice was average. The drink somehow was not as great as I expected it to be. For lunch we ordered lamb man'oushe. The crust was extremely soft and tasty and the topping was very well seasoned. I would recommend the pizza as it was very well cooked and presented. For dessert we ordered cheese cake. The biscuit base could be a little more crispy but over all the taste was good. Later on we were given a complimentary iced tea which was a good drink. This place also offers hookha which are well flavoured and with good coal. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a casual ambience and good staff.,Rated 3.5,3,125,??
Oshit Walia,"Rated You wanna try lebanese, go to this place.A no. of multi cuisine places serve lebanese food but just for name sake-only 2-3 dishes which again turn out to be the combination of lebanese with slight of Indian flavours.But this place is solely dedicated towards lebanese cuisine and serves you with ample of variety. Ambiance: Ambiance is decent-slightly cold i would say.I liked the interior wood finish with wooden racks and wood logs. Food: First,they serve you with complimentary bread sticks with lebanese dip,and this dip taste so good, with slight of basil and pepper flavours,that you can have it with all the starters and mains if you want. From the drinks i tried watermelon and passion fruit juice,flavours are mostly dominated by watermelon though and i didn't like the seeds present in the drink.Next,i tried zaatar and cheese manushe,which they call it as their speciality, but it seemed nothing more than thin crust pizza with pita based base and Zaatar tasted like Garam Masala in Olive oil.I definitely liked complementary pickle they serve with it :D.Next i tried falafel roll,and it has got so strong flavour of basil that it dominates the falafel and pickle flavours,had the basil been little i would have rated it 5/5.Coming to the best part-Chocolate Banana Man'ouche, it doesn't look like dessert a bit, but it tasted one of the most balanced desserts ever tried. It has got bread and chocolates as ingredients but it is not dry even a bit,you can have it all without even a single sip of water needed,thanks to its blend with banana and careful preparation.Trust me you can go to this place just to try this dessert.

Vasundhra Gupta,"Rated Hey reader, don't let my 3.5 let you change your mind about this place! We've yet to learn a LOT from the Lebanese cuisine, and this place is that authentic resource. Here's the story : 1. Ambiance - 4/5 An interesting combination of washed-in-white walls and furniture mixed, with wooden and colorful. To be honest, this mixture wasn't the most appealing to me. But nevertheless, the place reflects warmth and is quite welcoming with its well-lit look. 2. Food (veg) : --- Spicy Falafel with Tahini Sauce and Pita (5/5) MUST HAVE! My friend was quite skeptical to have Lebanese food because of his bad experiences so far, but Zomato's high ratings and reviewers' insistence on authenticity convinced him to try again. And this is what brought his faith back! Good portion size and well-presented as well. NOTE : It isn't actually spicy, definitely go for it! --- Potato Pie - 1/5 This is where disaster struck upon us. The experiment to try something new led to the mistake of ordering a bowl with mashed potato and boiled vegetables. Yikes! We had been recommended this dish by the stewards there, but I guess the dish isn't for everyone. After giving our feedback of having this unpleasant mash mess, the staff was extremely kind to offer a complimentary dessert for their unsatisfied customers. --- Complimentary dessert - 5/5 I wasn't able to catch the name of this dessert. But it's RICH, kesar-flavored, dipped in a sugary syrup and some fantastic other crispy ingredients. There are so many flavors and textures that absolutely blew our mind. And the complimentary factor has nothing to do with it! NOTE : YOU CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH, IT'S REALLY SWEET! (1 portion is good for 2 people with a sweet-tooth) 3. Beverages - FRESH! Oh my gosh! Astonishingly fresh watermelon juice and a well-done strawberry lemonade were the best organic-ingredient drinks I've ever had. Wow! 4. Service - 5/5 Kind, prompt and helpful in deciding what to order. I couldn't be happier. Final Verdict Authentic? YES! Fresh? YES! Good value for money if you can order the right things. I am looking forward to trying this place again for their other range of veg options, and this review is only based on the fact that so far, my experience was mixed for the food.

Sukriti Somvanshi,"Rated If there's one place with authentic Lebanese cuisine, then it's this. The restaurant is easy to locate due to their big big board. It's not huge, but not tiny either. Service is absolutely above average. So I ordered Lamb Manou'sh, which is like Lamb pizza. It was top class. Lamb seemed fresh and juicy and tasty. Also ordered a falafel roll, which wasn't the best. Falafel wasn't cooked very well, and the roll was sort of dry too. For drinks I ordered Turkish coffee, which was something totally different. Don't know good or bad, but yes, unique; and cafe blanc, which was sort of like flavoured hot water. It seemed like waste of money, but then again, their menu is traditional Lebanese, and that they served. So I'd give them 4/5 on service. 4/5 on food, only because they went wrong with something as basic as falafel. And 4.5/5 on ambiance.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Alka Sharma,"Rated Went today with 2other friends-31st may 2015. Its a very small place - housing around 9tables on the ground floor and there's a first floor too (I have not checked it out)- but we decided to sit on the ground floor. We ordered Strawberry lemonade, Watermelon Passion fruit and Mulberry juice + penne arrabiata and mezze platter. * Penne Arrabiata WITH THE LEBANESE TWIST was under cooked- nothing much to boast about the tasteless flavor and the chef forgot to add the twist part or maybe the twist was the tasteless flavor. To add a taste to the pasta- I ate it with the hummus. * Mezze platter tasted good but the portion size was too meagre - 2 falafel n 2pita which is actually too less for a platter ,this is like one portion size of a menu item and the cost is Rs550. Though the taste was good n authentic but then there was 3 of us - so I couldnt even eat a full falafel to judge its taste. Hummus,pickle was given in abundance as compared to pita n falafel-that created an imbalance. Pita bread was just a FULKA as thin as homemade chappati -not very fulfilling. This deceptive ""platter"" PLATE serves only one person but at other places the mezze platter is enormous serves 3 or 4 and costing half of what it is priced here. I was expecting a little more from Zizo- experience was a major let down. *strawberry lemonade was refreshing and was the only acceptable item I had there. *watermelon passion fruit drink- was mediocre and had dominating passion fruit flavor. #@drinks were 2/3rd liquid quantity and 1/3rd froth@# Staff- 5/5 Courteous n attentive. Food Quality - 3/5 Food Quantity- 1/5 Value for money- 1/5. Ambience - 2/5 Very tiny in size like one of those many CCDs.",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Food Loose,"Rated So after hearing a lot of good things abt Zizo, I headed there yesterday. Nice clean interior and all the pickled vegetables on display was very appealing to the eye. After going through the menu, I had to try very heard to not order hummus since I am a die hard hummus fan. So I decided to order chicken moghrabieh, Again I have a soft corner for Couscous .So when the menu said Lebanese Couscous , i had to give in. Moghrabieh was a meal in a bowl. Looked very authentic. it tasted very close to the kerala breakfast item puttu/Kadala . Similarity being the use of shallots ,chick peas and the moist rice pearl sort of texture of moghrabieh. Good, filling but not great.(It is no longer on their menu ) Since I am on a path to not indulge too much, I wanted to have a light creamy dessert.so Ashtalieh was just perfect.

Vinayak Gupta,"Rated Ambience - 4/5 Service - 4/5 Food - 3.5/5 We ordered a couple of starters, Man'oushe's , burger, drinks, etc. 1. Fattoush Salad - very good and well balanced salad dressing. Was very refreshing and was enjoyed thoroughly. 2. Traditional Falafel- regular falafel served with pita bread, pickles, sauce & salad leaves. Nothing out of the ordinary but was good. I really like the pita bread that seemed to be freshly made. 3. Zaatar Man'oushe - baked flat bread topped with herbs & olive oil. To me I think it could do with a Little less of herbs ( I guess it was thyme ) . It wasn't great at all. 4. Veg & cheese Man'oushe - flat bread topped with cheese n veggies. To me this was a total disappointment. Would never suggest anyone to have it. The bread was soggy, the topping lacked flavors and totally not worth it. 5. Shish Taouk roll - even though the menu said chicken, our server was kind enough to change it to lamb. Now this was the best dish of all. Nice juicy lamb kebabs rolled in a pita bread with generous amount of hummus. Very flavorful and a delight to have. I can go to Zizo just to have this again and again. 6. Falafel Burger - not on the menu right now. Our server suggested us the burger from the upcoming new menu. Big fat falafel patty with cheese ( too much cheese - pls reduce the quantity of cheese) was at the centre of this decent burger. The cheese kind of kills the flavor of falafel and of other ingredient. I would suggest that they should take a cue from the rolls and implement the same as the filling in the burgers.",Rated 3.5,36,80,??

My friend & I are in continuous struggle to find out the best possible option available and again, we found ourselves in CP. In search of a new, refreshing taste and cuisine, we reached here, ZIZO. And it didn't fail to impress me. :) Ambience : 4/5 As you enter the place, you are greeted by the manager who helped us to the seats. The walls were decorated with paintings which made the place lively. The well-lit dining rooms helped amplify the vibe of this place. The place was warm and cozy. Staff/Service : 4.5/5 The staff was polite and understanding. After asking once, they refrained from unnecessary feedbacks when we were having our dinner. The service was swift and efficient. I couldn't find anything wrong with them. Well done :) However, their uniforms can be changed and be made cheerful. Food : 4.5/5 Well, this is the first time I properly had LEBANESE cuisine.

Soumya Prakash,"Rated Okay so my friend decided to go to this place, since it had good ratings. The place was empty, because it was a weekday, but the ambience was good. We ordered a mini bites platter and strawberry lemonade, watermelon juice and mint lemonade. The drinks were really good. In the platter, the one with the spinach was not good, more so because i don't like spinach, the one with cheese filling was really tasty, and the mini Lebanese pizzas were okay-ish. This was the first time i went to some lebanese outlet, and my advice would be to ask clearly what are the ingredients and what exactly the dish is, since lebanese cuisine is something not everyone knows about. Overall, it was an okay-ish experience for us.",Rated 3.5,73,262,??
Srishty,"Rated Let me begin by saying I love Lebanese food and have always been in search of it in Delhi. Finally the search came to an end, with my visit to Zizo! They serve authentic Lebanese food, and not an Indianised version of it. Most of their ingredients are imported and organic. The food is prepared with finesse and excellence, maintaining the integrity of the ingredients and their flavours. Ambience : Its been decorated with a combination of white and pop-up colours which brings the whole place alive! There are a lot of funky paintings, wooden logs, pickled jars and a donkey sculpture used as decoration. Coming to the donkey, I was told it has a significance in the ambience, since donkeys are used to carry food around in the village. The pickles which are used to give the place a zing, serve dual purpose, as they are also for sale. Overall, its beautiful and vibrant ! Service : As we entered, a waiter greeted us and seated us at our table. Just as we began to go through the menu, the owner came along to ask about our experience, seeing we just sat down, he began by telling us about the restaurant and then suggested us the entire meal we ordered, and we loved all of it ! Then he later came around to ask whether we liked the food. Overall, the service was just as enthusiastic as their ambience was vibrant. Food Review- Everything is served with freshly baked pita ! ( The reason I love this place even more! ) Falafel served with Traditional Hummus, Tahina : Falafel is the most traditional Lebanese starter, and they nailed it! The hummus is made so beautifully, it sent me back to the streets of Dubai. Its smooth and silky, topped with olive oil and chickpea. As told by the owner, the best way to eat it is, stuff it between a half pita along with vegetables, pickle, tahina and hummus. Hummus Chicken Ras Asfour : Hummus with chicken and pomegranate molasses. Its heaven ! I could complete my meal with just this and pita and be content. Lamb Manush : The quality of the lamb was commendable, the best I have had in quite a while. Topped with chillies and pine nuts. Its exquisite, but at the same time not for everyone. Chicken Shawarma : We couldnt end a Lebanese meal without shawarma, and so we had to try it. Its made with perfection. Everything is just as you would expect, but strive to get in Delhi. Hand - Pressed Mint Lemonade : It makes you realise the true meaning of Organic. Overall, I loved Zizo. Specially impressed with the quality of their ingredients. The chicken and lamb were ravishing! The place isnt too expensive considering they are one of the few serving actual Lebanese. Must Try : Everything mentioned above ! lebensmittelsite.wordpress.com",Rated 4.5,43,138,??

Right opposite pvr plaza,it looks smaller from the outside but is huge on the first floor. We sat on the first floor which has bruit fully decorated side wall and counter.totally fresh ! We orders watermelon juice which was super fresh,mulberry juice (organic and too sweet for my taste) and strawberry as a lemonade (super yum ) For food we orders flat bread manou'she kind of a pizza which had tomato as toppings which was so light that we hardly felt anything in our tummies (good thing as we got to gorge on more food ?) And finally we ordered the famous falafel rolls which came accompanied with pickled salad.delicious is the word for it. Super happy with the food,drinks and the service.the staff is polite,smart and swift. Our bill for three came to be Rs 1400/- with taxes The only bummer that they don't serve alcoholic drinks.

Nidhi Paliwal | Www.spiceandstyle.com,Rated I love Lebanese food. My college life was spent eating falafel rolls. And I personally love hummus and pita. It's so light yet so full of flavor. So one day while strolling in cp last year.. I saw this newly opened Lebanese place. And it only served Lebanese and Mediterranean food so I hoped for authentic Lebanese and quickly entered the restaurant. First thing that caught my eye was the quirky yet classy colourful decor. Main theme was white with colourful cushions n chairs. D ground floor isn't too big but still u don't feel claustrophobic and there is enough space between the tables. It has a first floor too which has more space comparatively. D staff is very friendly n helpful. The service is quick. It was a new restaurant then so the manager himself asked us if v liked the food n explained the whole concept. They all made us feel very welcomed. FOOD- I have tried there classic n spicy hummus both. I loved both of them. Texture was perfect .. flavour was well balanced and it tasted fresh. For people who don't like hummus because they think it's bland... U all should try the spicy hummus. It's with a twist and a stronger taste. And I personally liked it more than the classic hummus. There fattoush salad is also amazing. Must try. I also tried their falafel rolls and veggie man oushe. Falafel rolls were delicious. But I still think they cn do better with the man oushe. It felt little soggy. I would have liked it more crisp. And I forgot to mention they give this complimentary cucumber dip with bread sticks..which is my favorite. . The dip is so refreshing. I m in love. So Since that day I have visited this place 2-3 times.. N it's one place I recommend to all Lebanese food lovers.. Must try,Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

"Aman- ""The Foodzilla""","Rated This place brought up my first fine dine kinda experience of Lebanese cuisine, before this, it was all based on random shawarma and falafel joints. We actually went for F&F at PVR Plaza, and accidentally spotted this place offering Lebanese cuisine with a twist and that very moment decided our spot for the day's lunch. The place was very quiet in the noon witg just one table occupied and no background music. We opted for sitting on the upper level. The menu had variety of dishes, most of which were totally unfamiliar to us. Even the waiters couldn't very clearly describe the preparations. So going safe, our order consist of a mezze platter and a chicken shawarma. The order took a good 20 minutes yo be served which passed by easily with the complementary starter consisting spicy pita sticks with some yoghurt based dip. The dip was quiet good and had a refreshing taste, by the time the sticks got over, we had our food on the table. The mezze platter looked very tempting, it had a bowl of fattoush salad, a basket with two warm freshly made pita, and a try consisting hummus, spicy moutabal, pickled veggies and falafel. The salad was had fresh crispy veggies, minty tangy dressing, everything required to be a good salad, bang on. Pita bread was warm soft and went very well with the hummus. I personally did not liked moutabal that much, firstly, i could not deduce what the thing actually is,moreover its taste was kind of bland and lacked some punch. Falafel were just fine, I've had much better at smaller joints. Chicken shawarma- extremely delicious soft, tender minced chicken with some perfectly complimenting spices rolled up in pita. This was the best part of meal, although it had nothing extra ordinary, still the taste was pleasing and the taste buds kept asking for me. Wish could have tried more from the menu, but the above was more than filling for two, well some other time.

Food Trippin,"Rated Zizo. A pretty name for a pretty place. Had this on my wish list for a while, and finally got a chance to visit it this week. The photos, the rating, the menu and the reviews set the bar high and I expected this place to be buzzing on a Weekend. Anyway, was a little empty when I walked in with just one table occupied and the place seemed a bit dull. The music was slow and quiet, though the fact that it was Arab added to the authenticity. Small disclaimer here, I'm not an expert at Mediterranean food, so I'm only talking about the food as it tasted to me and not the authenticity or it's rating on that scale. We ordered a couple of drinks, a Cheese and Zaatar Man'ouche, A Zaatar Man'ouche and an Osmalieh to finish off. The food seemed well prepared, the service was decent and the preparation was fast. The taste was pretty good, but it sort of does justify its positive rating on Zomato. The dessert was promising and good, though after a few bites, we decided to pass because the taste was a little over powering and we felt full. All in all, pretty relaxed place you can come to for trying out something new, but if you're a Lebanese fan, then this is definitely for you.

After a lengthy discussion of where to head for some authentic Lebanese food in Connaught Place , I recommended to head to Zizo , a place yet to explore . Thankfully , the decision didn't backfire at all . The food although not that exceptional was fresh , warm and authentic enough to set the taste buds dancing . We started with some nice beverages namely the Hand Pressed Mint and Strawberry Lemonades which really beat the heat . It was followed by the Shish Taouk Rolls which I must say , were cooked to perfection . Then we went with the chef's recommendation of the Hummus Chicken Ras Asfour which was basically a spicy Lebanese Chicken dish mixed in an Arabic sauce on a bed of Hummus and Pita breads . It stood up to be counted as the star attraction of the meal hands down .

Arushi Nanda Gogna,"Rated We visited Zizo in Connaught Place, a Lebanese- Mediterranean restaurant. I went in with a lot of apprehension, expecting some very usual Hummus-Pita-Shish Touk type dishes. But I was pleasantly surprised! The menu was fun to read, and had some very authentic dishes. As we placed our order, the waiter brought us a few chips (not sure what they are called) with a yogurt based dip. The chips were really good, but the dip was chilled, yummy and refreshing! It won my heart even before the food arrived! Good job, Zizo! We ordered a Cheese and Zataar Man'oushe, which essentially was a half-n-half pizza, with cheese and spices. It was crisp, extremely fresh and full of flavor. When I took a bite of each slice, I realized that the spices were a little too much for me, so I made a little sandwich of each slice and tried eating it with fresh olives and pickled carrot. This is when I fell in love with this little pizza- sandwich dish! We devoured the entire dish in no time! Then came the time to order my favorite part of the meal- Dessert! We were really confused, so we headed over to the display, while our server patiently explained each dessert to me. Upon his recommendation, we took Osmalieh. This was the most beautiful dessert available. This is a layered dessert, beautifully surrounded with sweet rose water. I will purposely not describe the dish, because it might ruin the mystery if you plan on ordering it. It was simply amazing! They brought us the bill in a tiny Fez, which I found completely adorable!

Upasana,"Rated Food tastes in its perfect flavours and gives satisfaction only in condition when you respect your food Executive Chef #Danny #Elsoury. No wonder you will definitely feel the simplicity and pleasure of being in streets of #Lebanon, once you enter #Zizo Restaurant , located in Connaught Place. I was delighted on getting an enthusiastic and energetic welcome by #CEO Mr. #Fouad Abdel Malak, a man full of positive vibes and running his restaurant with excellent energy. The moment you step in the restaurant you will be mesmerized by the awesome fragrance of freshly baked Pita breads, baked in a special hearth which has been brought from the streets of Lebanon approximately 3,945KM far from New Delhi. Special adjustment of fire nozzles in the hearth gives excellently baked round shaped pita breads. Astonishing ambience with four different sections for dining are decorated with multiple varieties of #pickles & #Olive oil Bottles (imported from Lebanon ), beautiful paintings on simplicity of life, different Lebanese recipe books (as chef dont prefer to hide his recipes) and a projector screen, which collectively gives you a amusing experience to have Lebanese cuisine. Your experience of dining in Zizo restaurant will surely turn up with more #""wow"" factor when warmth and touch of #Fouad & #Dannys team's hospitality and services touches all the necessary requirements and take extra care for everything while you dining there. As I was the lucky one to have dinner with Danny & Fouad, the boy- #Shantanu had made this experience one step upper with his prompt service and all time smiley face :-). Fouad has built up his restaurant in a way so that one can experience the beauty of Lebanon there only. The look outside from his home in Lebanon is amazingly captured and fitted to the walls , which depicts the normal day to day routine life surroundings. A half donkey statue with hanging vegetables was key attraction for kids, they were looking very happy by pulling Donkeys tail. Fabulous menu creativity and designing done by Mr.Fouad, looks very interesting & peppy. Dinner was entirely entertained by #Chef Danny, which started with #Fattoush Salad- combination of fresh vegetables with fried pieces of crunchy pita, a mouth-watering roll of pita bread with stuffing of #Falafel ( tasty deep fried chickpeas & beans patty) in the layer of #Moutabel (delicious aubergine dip) was presented by chef with choice of pickles & Olives. The taste is still persisting in my mouth, and I will definitely go back to have this again. #Tahini dip and #spicy #Hummus were a pleasant surprise for me, Spicy doesnt mean too chilly or hot here, its simply the blend of whole spicesmixed in hummus for flavour. I really enjoyed Lebanese small pizzas #Zaatar & #Lamb #manoushe with spicy hummus dip. Its nice to enjoy #Mulberry juice with the flavour and fragrance of orange blossoms , concentrated mulberry is being imported specially from Lebanon to give it a touch of Lebanese drink. Coming in a Lebanese restaurant and not having #Shawarma is like going to a Punjabi dhaba and not having butter chicken, Juicy Chicken shawarma with traditional #garlic dip was one of that dish of zizo which can drag you for dining here anytime and a tempting #Rice #pudding dessert after this will surely increase your desire to visit here again and again. Fouads team expedite services with warm welcome and specific Lebanese flavours from chef Dannys kitchen has undoubtedly brought a mini Lebanon in our Delhi.

(Where even water is imported from Lebanon), I wanted to try what ""pure"" Lebanese good tastes here in Delhi. So. Zizo here promised the pure Lebanese food. It was half empty. Not crowded. Not many Lebanese food loving people around I guess. So we got the seat as we wanted without any hassle. We took a long time deciding what to order. It was a tough task. Finally we ordered chicken sharma roll and falafel roll at first and then decide if we want anything more. So we ordered. We were told it would take maximum 10 minutes. So we waited. 10 minutes passed. We waited. 20 minutes passed. We waited. 30 minutes passed. And we waited. (This time with 2 times complaint and asking if we should leave ) They apologised for mistake. And gave us complimentary salad and breadsticks. So. I hope they are not always late. There must have been some problem. It is okay guys. Thanks for complimentary things. But please make sure to inform customers before hand if the food is going to be delayed. Let's come to the taste. Okay. Salad was great. Fattoush salad. Tasted better than riyadh one. Because of lemon juice in it. But presentation is exactly same. Rolls. Falafel roll was just fine. Nothing great.

Ankush Mohanty,"Rated Zizo brings the experience of traditional Lebanese food with authentic ingredients to give the Indian palate an amazing culinary experience The above lines by Chef Maroun Chedid of Zizo at their launch party in July hold true to every word. Giving the traditional Lebanese cuisine a twist, Zizo has got the Delhi food lovers what they desired the most. The interiors are smart with an entire section of the wall being converted into a shelf with books, traditional caps and lamps. And on the other side, there is a huge sign which yells, ZIZO, the beetle. I dont know whether this was the thought behind this but the small little cap reminded of Abu, Aladdins monkey in the cartoon series. Coming to the food, they have described each item in detail as the menu has the traditional names written for every food item. Sticking to the roots is one thing which these guys follow to precision. We started with lamb Manushe, it is a traditional thin crust pizza with lamb with spicy yoghurt. The crust was delicious as it comes and the garnished pine nuts took the flavour to all together different level. Squeeze the lemon wedge and that adds the tanginess to the lamb as well and then dip a piece in the yoghurt and you will never go wrong. Extra portions of the yoghurt were called for. Then came the Shish Taouk roll, it had grilled chicken with garlic sauce. For all the garlic lovers out there (including me), this is one thing which you should not miss. Although the roll drips as soon as you bite into it but all the filling is soaked in the sauce. The veggies accompanying the roll are a huge let down. They are just boiled and nothing else. At the end we went for their cheesecake (Do not raise your eyebrows), I was forced to order this. But having said that, it did not disappoint in the true sense of the word. The essence of the cheesecake was there alright but the topping of a sweet sauce made us scrap that and have the layers below. Also, pistachios do make an entrance with our cheesecake here. All in all, the place is nicely decked up and is very spacious with different sections for people to sit. Also, with Lebanese/Mediterranean cuisine gaining importance among the new age food lovers, Zizo is here to crawl right into everyones hearts.",Rated 3.5,103,370,??

Food: Good over all - won't say excellent because was disappointed with the shish-touk roll, but the spicy hummus makes up for everything Service: Very good! very friendly staff and very prompt service.

Hummus and pita bread - excellent quality of hummus and fresh pita bread. Very Good Chicken Shawarma roll - The chicken in the roll was outstanding and had a wonderful smoked flavor. The roll was served with sour cream and pickled vegetables. Strawberry lemonade - it was pretty good and refreshing. Though when I told them that I don't want ice, they gave me half a glass only. Rs 160 plus taxes for half a glass lemonade - a lil disappointing :(. I packed a shishtouk roll for my husband, he also seemed to like it.

Gautam Ghai,Rated Zizo is an interesting take on Lebanese and Med cuisines that gives a fresh perspective on what we understand of the cuisine in India. The Zataar Manoushe was really yummy - the cheese Manoushe not so much. We enjoyed the platters - The mini bites platter is great value for money - however the Mezze platter while being well put together is far too small for the 720 + Taxes that they charge. I also enjoyed the Village Stew and the Potatoe pie - but preferred the later. Would be really awesome to get some more variety for veggies. A good experience - barring the portion sizes.

We ordered a Mezze Platter, Strawberry Lemonade, Chicken Shawarma, Falafel Shawarma, Shish Touk Roll and their Chocolate & Banana Manoushe. The Strawberry Lemonade is a must try for anyone going to Zizo, it is refreshing and different and cuts through all the flavours when you're eating your food. The spicy hummus, shawarmas, pickled veggies and pita bread is fresh, flavorful and delicious. It fills you up just enough for dessert. The Manoushe is scrumptious and just the amount of sweet you'd need. The service is quick and staff is friendly.

We ordered falafels for starters- they tasted a little sour, had expected better from an authentic Lebanese restaurant. The accompaniments were very good- roasted pita bread with tahini and pickles. For the main course, we ordered Manakeesh- Zaatar and cheese and vegetable. These were comparable with the best I've had even in the Middle east. The pastry was just right and the Zaatar was very fresh. The bill came hidden inside a small Lebanese hat-very cute!!.

Vipul Chejara,"Rated How about something new on the New Years Day? Thats how Lebanese Food got into action. It was the very first hand at Lebanese food & Zizo was first to Strike up. We had a whole group meeting up for the New Year celebration. Thankfully Zizo offered us corporate lunch on the menu. On the chilly winter day, complete Warmth was the very feeling to it. The tables were set & clean on the arrival. And soon, a whole lot of food was up for grabs, one at a time, both veggies & non-veggies. With the rim of plate being a frame, food on the plate was like a painting having classical arrangement having the hot basket of Lebanese bread and mild warm dips that seemed perfectly cooked. For the many of us first timers, the hummus was a bit sour in taste (we Indians like spicy you know!), gradually that tasted great. Best part being the serving staff knew much about the food & ingredients they are using. Zizo is sure a visit again for me. There was some minutes of waiting for the main course, hence a rating of 4.5.

Monil Singhal,"Rated Zizo, a fairly recent chain in Delhi, has already created waves amongst Lebanese food lovers. Unlike the existing 'shawarma' joints or fancy restaurants on the other extreme, Zizo, a mid-range, casual dine, which promises 'Lebanese with a modern twist' has impressed everyone. It opened up right in front of PVR Plaza in Connaught Place, a very convenient location. The restaurant has two floors and is quite spacious. The whole place is brightly lit, simple yet elegant and has a very cheerful ambience. The menu offers a very limited range, but it is quite authentic. I tried the Spicy Falafel, Cheese and Zataar Manoushe, Shish Taouk Roll and the Strawberry Lemonade. Before the meal arrived, we were served some crispy pita sticks with a dip (yogurt based I thought) which made the waiting time seem shorter. The Strawberry lemonade lived up to expectations - it had a great balance of flavours and was very refreshing. The Falafel was amazing too, as they were perfectly crisp on the outside and full of flavour. The pita bread was freshly made and served warm which made it even better. The Cheese and Zataar Manoushe was a bit of a let down, since the two toppings were half and half, making one side bland and the other a tad too salty. The Shish Taouk Roll was nice, with a strong garlic flavour but it was more citrusy than required. The service was extremely good. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Even when its crowded, its not hard to find someone. They were well versed with the menu, helpful and efficient. Surprisingly, its pretty decently priced too. Great ambience, good food - the perfect place to start your Lebanese journey!

Aqualini,"Rated THE BEST WAS SAVED FOR LAST MUST HAVE: Osmalieh (DESSERT) Zizo is a charming restaurant in the heart of CP with bright, colourful interiors and attentive staff. We had the hand-pressed mint lemonade, which could have done with more than a smattering of minced mint and the strawberry lemonade which was refreshingly different. The complimentary pita sticks and dip were quite addictive, but the prompt service of the food ensured that we did not fill our tummies with them. The cold Mezze Platter gave us a taste of most of the other Mezzes on offer. Quite enjoyed the hummus, mutabal and the fatoush. The falafels as usual were too dry for my liking. Now, I' m an ardent lover of anything lemon, I drown my food in lime juice and am not ashamed to admit it. However, the lemony quotient in the cuisine here, is in a different league by itself and really needs to be toned down. Especially since the sides of pickled vegetables are vinegared. The lamb kabab platter was average, am not too big a fan of lamb anyway, and they were pretty much sheek kababs in a slightly different avatar (avatar I liked). I did enjoy the Lamb Manoush, minced lamb on pita bread, their version of a pizza. The bread was crisp and fresh and the topping was well executed. Then came dessert - the best part of the meal, the Osmalieh. A nest of crunchy vermicelli which encased the lightest fluffiest cream filling that just exploded in our mouths. However, there was just too much vermicelli that interfered with the sublime filling that in the end we moved most of the vermicelli aside while devouring the dish. I would go back just for this dessert and wouldn't be averse to trying out the other sweet treats. Oh, and I did like cute little fez that the bill arrives in. UPDATE: Returned just for dessert a few months later. Ordered the osmalieh and the chocolate banana man'oush. Found they have reduced on the vermicelli but then it seems that the cream filling inside has also reduced proportionately. And this time the vermicelli wasn't as crispy and kind of bogged the dish down. But still enjoyable. The chocolate banana man'oush was below average in terms of a dessert. It was just a tortilla wrap spread with chocolate sauce, banana and nuts. I can do that at home for a fraction of the price. And this was actually recommended to us. I would have preferred to try the baklava cheesecake instead.",Rated 3.5,34,103,??
Chashmish Reviews,"Rated Explored Zizo while strolling around during the Raahgiri days in CP. Felt the need of breakfast after a quick walk so visited this place. The interiors are pretty nicely done. Feels cozy and the whitish interiors with the Lebanese native video playing on a screen makes you feel you're one of them. The few items I tried from their menu were the Veggie & Cheese Man' oushe , Watermelon Juice & the Double Egg Omlettefrom their special breakfast menu which I reckon is not available anymore. The food was really good. The man'oushe was freshly baked in front of me and was aptly crispy. BUT two things I want to pin point; the service as well as the price. This is definitely not low on pocket and the service was extremely slow. The billing and the payment took them about 45 mins which is bizarre!

Aarohi Sen,"Rated I had been wanting to visit for quite some time and I finally did this Friday. I was impressed by the decor. We took a booth for four, but some of the tables upstairs looked too small for comfort. The food choices are limited, the drinks choices you can count on your fingers. But we never had a problem ordering because we were craving for Lebanese. I liked the taste but some of my friends found it a bit on the bland side. The portions were small. After ordering 6 entrees we still felt we had only snacked. No wonder we were surprised when the bill was close to 5000. Overall I don't think I spent my money well but I can't put my finger on what went wrong. Maybe cause I have never been served Lebanese in large portions anywhere in Delhi.",Rated 3.5,23,183,??
Luv  Nijhawan,"Rated Blame it on my Dubai stint, but my expectations from Arabic food (for God sake, please stop branding it as Lebanese food ONLY) are perhaps higher than the average foodie. That said I did enjoy my lunch experience at this cosy little joint. The khuboos were oven fresh and fluffy, definitely a thumbs up. Lamb pizza was average and the shawarma was a let down (for a true Arabic experience, it didn't even have potato fries in it). Though it looked quite appealing, I haven't really eaten 'pink' colored humus or moutbel, ever. A little beetroot would surely not harm, but it didn't accentuate the flavor of the dip either. All in all, not a very pleasant practice. Desserts were OK: had the baklawa sampler (very disappointed with the quantity; agreed that they might be importing them from Arabia, but they are definitely charging a bomb for the portion served), bousbous (the semolina bases pastry) and halawa baked cheese cake. I must say, it is an expensive place, so do bear that in mind. And, just like in the Middle East, alcoholics will be disappointed. All said, it is worth a try (for the true foodie)!",Rated 3.0,17,51,??
Va,"Rated We went on a Christmas evening . The ambiance of this place was extremely colorful and beautiful to look at . Check out the photos to get an idea . For me , I expected to see more non-spicy dishes on the menu but sadly for me there weren't many options .Before the meal is served you get a small free appetizer of pita chips and yogurt dip . What I ordered was the lamb and rice dish with roasted nuts was without chili unlike all the other dishes on the menu . The lamb could have been more tender and less tough and the good part is is comes with plain yogurt and gravy . I also ordered the mint lemonade which was sweet but tasted good . My favorite part of this place is the ambiance , service and on the table it states if you like their Zizo facebook page you get a free small sweet dish at the end of your meal ! They gave us some busbussa which is a semolina dish. My husband loved the chicken shawarma and potato pie . He took me as a surprise and it was worth the visit . They also have tea available for winter but it is not the menu if you are interested in having a sweet with tea or arabic coffee . The prices - medium Lebanese food is made with a healthy twist in mind . I recommend giving it a try ! I will also make sure I visit again . Sodexo is also accepted",Rated 4.5,12,21,??
Tulika Sharma,"Rated I have been waiting to write this review for long, but was busy with my schedule. So finally here is my version of Zizo's visit which was around September. If you love trying out new flavours of a different country Zizo offers them all. In a mood for authentic Lebanese food...Zizo is the place to be. The dishes are authentic and healthy Lebanese with fresh and organic ingredients sourced straight from Lebanon farms. I went to Zizo for my lunch date and was greeted by a hospitable staff and the owner of the place Fouad. He was kind enough to give us a tour of the place as well as suggest us few items. The place has a lovely ambience with an array of pickles on display which just adds to the vibrant decor. We chose to sit on first floor amidst lovely pictures on display. Fouad helped us with the order and we decided to go with mulberry juice and watermelon passion fruit juice for drinks and spicy hummus, spicy falafel, hummus chicken ras asfour, lamb manoushe and chocolate banana manoushe. While we waited for our order we were served complementary pita croutons and dip which were great to nibble at while waiting. The mulberry juice was a delight and a new flavour for my taste buds. It has no added sugar and has an inherent sweetness which is amazing. The watermelon passion fruit juice was refreshing and perfectly balanced. The hummus has a great texture and flavour. The spicy falafel was great with fava beans adding to its crunchiness and the pickles adding to its tanginess. This is a must try!! The hummus chicken ras asfour was a delight. The lamb manoushe was like thin crust pizza but the base being more like our chapattis, so we rolled it and enjoyed it. To end our amazing food journey we had chocolate banana manoushe which was more like a crepe filled with banana and chocolate and we really enjoyed it. But I wanted more chocolate in it. I wish they serve it with some extra chocolate on side. Throughout our lunch we found Fouad visiting every table and getting peoples opinion. He was sweet enough to bring Chef Danny to our table so that we get to meet him. Thanks to team Zizo for the wonderful experience. I am definitely visiting it again to try more dishes.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Prateek Arora,"Rated Zizo is a refreshing change to the otherwise limiting definition of Lebanese food that existed in Delhi for so long, usually summarised by randomly thrown ""mezze platters"" in food menus. With its well lit, colorful interiors with a prominent display of large jars containing picked vegetables alongside authentic Lebanese products, Zizo gives the impression of a friendly, neighborhood bar. While we waited for our order to arrive, the smell of freshly baked Pitas filled the air. And then the moment of truth.. The Fattoush salad was nice and tangy with the right crunch in vegetables. The traditional falafel served with pita and tahini sauce is a treat even for non-vegetarians and tastes fresh and better than many other options available out there. The manoushe is another great discovery which is nothing but a Lebanese flatbread (think of a wafer thin crust pizza) with simple toppings. But the beauty lies in its simplicity. We tried the Zataar Manoushe (thyme) and Cheese Manoushe both of which were great. While you enjoy the main course, one must call for a bowl of Lebanese olives and hummus on the sides. They are a great addition to the meal to nibble on. The Lebanese Potato Pie fills you up just right and the Chicken Moghrabieh (Lebanese couscous with braised chicken and oriental gravy) has slight resemblance to Indian flavours and I feel will go down well with many restaurant goers still wanting to go safe. For desserts, one MUST have their Baked Halava cheesecake which is a great innovation. Halwa+Cheesecake might not sound very tempting but the reality is a bit too different :) What was common in all dishes we ordered is the high quality of ingredients, perfect example being the hummus. It will be a pity if Delhiites don't get hooked on to the lovely Lebanese offering at Zizo!",Rated 4.5,13,85,??
Surabhi Bhattal,"Rated So here my first take on Lebanese food and yes I loved it totally.

Pallavi Kaul,"Rated One of the few Lebanese places in delhi, my friend and I decided to try out this place. It's a huge place with two floors and ample seating. Apart from the food, there are things such as pickled vegetables, books, mugs etc that you can buy. Food- wanting to try something different apart from the usual hummus pita and a mezze platter, we ordered some lamb kebab platter. The kebab was juicy and tender, served with pita, some dry chopped salad, pickled vegetables and a small portion of hummus. Everything on the plate was amazing. Next we tried the cheese and zaatar manoushe which was basically a thin crust pizza with cheese, thyme and some herbs served with pickled vegetables. This dish was pretty Average. The strawberry lemonade was refreshing just a little too sweet. Overall it was a decent meal. The service was alright. Although the waiters don't know much about the cuisine it seemed. The pricing is a little expensive. Though going by the prices of restaurants these days, it's normal. Overall a good place to try out Lebanese food. Will definitely go for more.",Rated 3.5,49,571,??
Shaun Lobo,Rated Zizo brings with it to Delhi a completely new gastronomical journey. Lebanese food in a casual dining avatar. While the cuisine is relatively new to me I have come to love the freshness of the ingredients and the subtle taste variations which make dining at Zizo a great experience. I would strongly recommend paying this restaurant a visit. My favourites are the lamp platter and the hummus which is by far the best I have eaten in India. The tomato and zatar manouche are also just divine.The mulberry juice is possibly the tastiest juice I have ever drunk ever!,Rated 4.5,2,154,??
Piyush,Rated I m crazy about lebanese food. So we found out this place from zomato . Called them to confirm the location they were prominent on telling me the location. The moment we reached there we couldn't see their board as it was hardly visible. Finally we went inside. The feel is totally Mediterranean. We ordered two vegetarian dishes . They were good but I think they were too authentic . Have had lebanese before as well which might be modified as per Indian taste. I went there with a lot of expectations but I was not fully satisfied. My wife check in at face book . For that we got a free desert. Will I come back. May be.,Rated 3.5,1,9,??
Purabi Dutta Chowdhury,"Rated We did not know about Zizo. We just happened to be in front of it at lunch time after some excursion and promise of authentic lebanese platter appealed to us. So entered it just on a whim. It has ample space spreading over ground as well as first floor and has a pleasant feel to it. Nicely decorated, but not over the top. wash room is also neat and clean Staff is polite and friendly without being overbearing. Service quite prompt. Food is good. We opted for just two dishes as we were not very hungry - hummus chicken ras asfour and grilled lamb kebab platter. We were served a complimentary item of pita croutons with a dip. Food was delicious. I am not very knowledgeable about lebanese cuisine. but the pita bread here seems a bit different resembling more to our desi phulkas than at other places like Urban Cafe. However, I liked the taste here also. But some of the dips were a bit too sour to our taste. One grouse I have is that they never told us about the FB check in option wherein one gets entitled for complimentary dessert which we came to know about later.

Rishi,"Rated Zizo has a very nice soothing ambiance. Done largely in white and light shades with Arabic music in the background, it gives a very good feel and a welcome change from dimly lit restaurants . The furniture is also tasteful with a combination of chairs, sofas and bar stools. Service was good and so was the food. I went there with my wife and we ordered grilled chicken taouk platter, mint lemonade and since we were still hungry we ordered a mini bites platter. Chicken was soft and moist, fresh and you could taste the herbs. The only low was the sourness of the salad. It could have been a little less sour. Vinegar was overpowering. There were relatively very few non vegetarian options in the menu, which was a disappointing thing for my wife who loves meat. Also besides the Turkish coffee (which we were told is 3 to 4 time stronger than an espresso) if something else can be added as a hot beverage it would be great. Overall the experience was good. BTW, I liked the way menu has been made, with graphics and a story :)",Rated 4.0,2,0,??
Sajid Vincent Ledger Khan,"Rated Bang opposite the PVR Plaza in Connaught Place, is Zizo (a Lebanese speciality eatery); a place with interesting dcor & ample space. With ample expectations we marched in and to be honest, it was a nice experience which was fulfilling yet light on the tummy. The culinary journey was as follows, Chips with Yogurt dip (served complimentary) its an interesting thing to nibble on while you wait for your food, the chips were very crisp & tasty and the dip was very refreshing Strawberry Lemonade We ordered 1 but the server maybe heard wrong or simply assumed that since we were 2 of us and got us 2 drinks and I was almost about to return 1 when all of a sudden it seemed that the drink actually called out to me & boy was I pleased when I took my 1st sip of the strawberry lemonade it was brilliant - simply put, the best lemonade I ever had Grilled Lamb Kebab Platter (grilled lamb kebabs served with 2 pita breads, a bit of salsa, pickled vegetables & a spot of hummus) a touch on the costlier side considering the portion size, but nonetheless loved the platter kebabs were juicy, pitas were fresh, hummus was creamy & delicious Chicken Shawarma Roll (very decent portion size, served with pickled vegetables) maybe this is the real deal and I am not aware of it (after all I am not a professional chef or an experienced food critic), but somehow my taste buds are more inclined to the friendly neighborhood shawarma joints, on my 2nd visit I would surely give it a pass Lamb Manoushe (in my laymans language, I would call it an extremely thin crusted pizza topped with minced meat & a handful of pine nuts) by the way, did I mention that it was very very tasty .. Wanted to get myself a serving of Baklawa to end the meal, but alas they were out of it. Then the server told us, use the check in option in Facebook & Zizo will serve you a COMPLIMENTARY FIXED DESSERT. Now, I dont care what people say or how they judge, but I like free food & I immediately checked in on my FB account and the dessert was in front of me. It was Osmalieh crunchy vermicelli topped with chopped nuts which hides a soft patty of rich cream. Loved the taste of the cream combined with the crunch of the vermicelli and on top of it was free. If I had to pay for this dessert, I would have said ouch!!! Not a VFM by any aspect. My ratings; Food 3.5/5 Service 3.5/5 Ambiance 3.5/5",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Abhinandita Banerjee,"Rated Off late a number of eating places serving Middle Eastern cuisines have sprung up across the city and Zizo in Connaught Place is the latest one to join the ranks. Serving authentic Lebanese food, Zizo prides itself in sourcing specific ingredients and condiment from different Arab countries and this does reflect in the food they serve which is very similar to the original versions. Spread over 2 floors, the place is rather big and has pleasant interiors. We walked into the restaurant one of these Sunday afternoons and found only a few diners around. For starters, we ordered Hummus Chicken Ras a Four along with a glass each of Watermelon Passion Fruit Juice and Mulberry Juice. While the drinks were pretty ordinary (seems preserved syrups were used instead of the actual fruits), the starter was pretty good. It was basically hummus topped with flavoured diced chicken and served with freshly prepared pita bread. This is one of the few places that serves freshly prepared pitas rather than the regular packaged ones or pre-made ones. Next we ordered in a Chicken Dibs Ruman Roll, which is essentially a Shawarma with Pomegranate Molasses. Pomeganate Molasses really enhanced the flavours of the dish and it seemed pleasantly different from regular Shawarmas. This was followed by the Oriental Leg of Lamb. This is basically roasted lamb with herbs placed over a heap of flavoured rice and served with a cravy. Flavours were subtle, like typical Middle eastern food. To end the meal, we asked for Baked Halawa Cheesecake. This dessert was absolutely brilliant and that is to say the least. Though the menu is limited, the best part is that it is not diluted and focus is on healthy Lebanese and Middle eastern food. Meal for two was Rs 2000 odd.",Rated 4.0,12,17,??

Gurvinder Singh,"Rated My friend and I had passed this joint a few times during our many walks around CP. It generally seemed empty and tiny place from the outside and the odd donkey's backside seemed interestingly weird. But today we put our apprehensions to rest and ventured in. And our assumptions were delightfully wrong. The place was as vacant as it seemed from the outside. The staff wad really nice and friendly. We had no idea about the nature of the food but we decided to go for it anyway. We ordered a mix platter and mezze platter for starters and a veg manhouse for the mains and salad along with fruit juices. The food is amazingly light, the manhouse a sort of pizza, had a fantastic thin base which delightfully soft. We went through the enire order like it was nothing. Its very rare to find taste and lightness together, very few places can pull that off. Eveything was hunky dory, untill the last sip of my juice when a fly decided to dive bomb it. The watermelon and passion fruit juice was other wise quite nice. Food and drinks set us back by about 2k.

Sba Garga,"Rated I have been hearing great things about Zizo ever since it opened. After multiple attempts to plan and check it out failed, I finally made it there this past Saturday. It was almost closing time as we had landed there at 10.30pm. I was so excited to get there and also slightly anxious if it would live up to the hype and did it live upto whatever expectations I had and more!! Bright, lively interiors; excellent food; great service and a genial owner peppering in stories and suggestions around the food. We had the lamb manoushe, the potato pie at the beginning and then still wanted more. As it was so close to their shutdown time we sheepishly asked if they could make us some thing else and they with a grin said...whatever you want! At the owners recommendation we had a mix of the grilled lamb and chicken platter and polished it off in minutes. Topped it off with Turkish coffee! Going to Zizo and eating there leaves one happy and smiling and for that they get absolute 5 stars!! Great job guys. Now hurry up and come down to Gurgaon :)",Rated 5.0,4,7,??
Shilpi Sharma,"Rated I recently visited this restaurant after hearing favourable reviews about it from many people. Needless to say, my expectations were pretty high. It's located right opposite Plaza in Connaught Place and is easy to spot. We entered, the restaurant seems bright and colourful, and has a good vibe. The menu seems to be quite limited and they could probably add some more dishes, especially in their main course. We started with a spicy hummus with came with complimentary pita bread. I cannot fault the hummus or the bread in any way, save for the fact that I was underwhelmed by the quantity. We also ordered some drinks (they don't serve alcohol), which were also decent. For the main course we ordered the chicken shawarma, the cheese and zaatar manoushe, the falafel wrap and the chicken taouk platter. The shawarma was nice and light, the manoushe was pretty average. The chicken Taouk platter was a bit bland for my taste but maybe that's how it's supposed to be. Overall, I wasn't very impressed with the place, not so much because of the food but the quantity, the prices and the limited menu were a bit disappointing.",Rated 2.5,7,3,??
Deeksha J,"Rated The greatest virtue of Middle-eastern food lies in its all-encompassing nature. Having been influenced from such diverse cultures, the cuisine can be likened to a ladle wielding, fun loving grandma, assimilating the most flavourful ingredients on offer, in her kitchen. Soul soothing, slow cooked stews, zesty pickled vegetables and aromatic spice rubbed chunks of meat its not hard to see why it appeals so much to the Indian populations palate. Lets not forget the dips and their versatility either. From 50/50 burgers to chips to piping hot pita bread, they can be slathered on pretty much everything available in the pantry. At Zizo (meaning a pet beetle), located bang opposite PVR Plaza, youll find the chefs hand rolling shawarmas and preparing delicious pita that can be used to scoop up lemony tahini and creamy hummus. Thats not all. This is also the place where the best lemonade of your life awaits you. Dont let summer pass without sipping on this one. On my last 2 visits to this place I have loved every bit of their spicy falafel (might explode with flavours any minute), lamb manoushe, chicken shawarma roll (crunchy in every bite), shish taouk roll and grilled chicken taouk platter, successfully polishing it down with their refreshing watermelon and passion fruit juice and the phenomenal mint lemonade. The bread basket equivalent at Zizo is crispy lavash served along with a variety of dips. It takes a whole lot of willpower to NOT finish this off in the first 5 minutes of your arrival at the restaurant. Special mention for their hummus though its so velvety and garlicky, it feels like you are watching a beautiful movie with subtitles in garlic! If you are looking to grab a quick bite at this place, the manoushe would be my recommendation. Its essentially flat bread topped with minced lamb and lots of organic herbs and spices. Utterly delicious and sits light on the stomach. The restaurant hasnt tried to come up with their takes on traditional Middle-eastern food. What they have done instead is present it in a casual, colourful environment, all elements intact, that makes the whole effort slightly more elevated than others. If youre in the neighbourhood, this is where your next meal should be.",Rated 4.5,84,1088,??

I like my rolls to hold up under biting and not disintegrate everywhere. [DEATH! DEATH TO THE UNEXPECTED RAW TOMATO AND ITS SQUISHY FEEL AND ITS GROSS TOMATO TASTE!] Also the first thing they brought us, their version of a bread basket had stale lavaash and too salty dip, so that needs to be fixed.

Ginny,"Rated One of my friend recommended me this place so I decided to try it out.. The ambience is nice.. Being a weekday lunch it was almost empty... To eat we ordered a spicy falafel and a grilled chicken taouk platter... Spicy falafel was very average. It was more like a vegetarian cutlet coming out of those frozen packed venkys and yummiez.. They were nice.. But not like falefal and not at all spicy .. It was accompanied by two pita breads and a tahini sauce.. The breads were hot and fresh, but the tahini sauce was again below average.. Coming to the chicken dish it was basically grilled chicken kept between two pita breads.. The dish looked great, grilled chicken was nicely grilled... The dish was accompanied with pickled veggies and sour cream.. The sour cream was pretty good... I thought that hummus is an important part of Lebanese food and it was very sad to see that they don't provide hummus even in a Lebanese platter... It was like u are being forced to order it separately.. The service was good, staff friendly... But they not even once during our one hour stay there thought that we should be provided with paper/ cloth napkins at any point.. This was really dissapointing...

Just the perfect thirst quencher. Next, i ordered a chicken Shwarma which was really tasty with the dip they had served us( No idea what it was, just forgot to ask) The Zatar and cheese manoushe was similar to a thin crust pizza, I did not like it much but the cheese part was good.

We ordered Veggie and Cheese Manuoshe, Traditional Falafel, and Chicken Shawarma Roll. Each dish was just perfect, in taste and quantity. We weren't sure about how to go about eating the falafel, but the servers were there to help us with that. The shawarma was too good for words, we devoured it in minutes. The pita was fresh and light. For drinks, we only tried the mulberry juice, which was again refreshing and delicious. We ended the meal with the Baked Halawa Cheese Cake - simply divine.

We tried the chicken shwarma, which was tasty, it seemed to be cooked with very little oil and was good. The shwarma was served with pickels and sauces and was a bit spicy and more sour in taste, due to the pickles served on the side of the dish.

The flat bread zataar and cheese pizza half n half, spicy hummus, chicken hummus, wraps and the very airy pita were all delicious. So was the strawberry lemonade made with fresh strawberries.

Lav,"Rated Food is what fills your stomach. Good food makes you lick your fingers. The best kind of food gives you an experience to cherish. THAT IS WHAT ZIZO IS ABOUT. The initial plan yesterday evening was to go to Monkey Bar in Connaught Place but they don't allow kids after 6 PM (Mr. and Mrs. Jupiter were getting one of their young ones - they have twins). So anyways the venue was shifted to Zizo and yours truely made the reservation. Now as I mentioned, this place is a full on experience. The interiors are so very modern and attractive. Very vibrant colours - whites, blue, red. They have this whole book shelf setting up on the first floor where we sat. Then on the ground floor they've placed a number of jars filled with pickled vegetables below the kitchen counter. And then of course the highlight - the very prominent display of their logo on the first floor. Browse the snaps for a visual treat (I missed the kitchen counter - damn). They had Lebanese music playing which set the tone very nicely. Long story long, very impressed with the decor. Now to the main ""Mudda"" - food. Of course we needed some help in deciding and the servers were very helpful. The order was a Veggie & Cheese Manoushe and Spicy Falafel. Now I really have no idea what the non-vegetarian company had ordered but one of them did get a roll. For the drink I got a Lemonade. The Falafel was a BANG - a knockout punch of flavours for the mouth. The sauces were FAB and the pickles were ummmm. I wish I'd tried to understand the details of what I was eating but I was too busy. The Manoushe aka Lebanese Pizza was ok - we like finished it in 1 minute flat. We had to get one more plate of Falafel and we did - this time the traditional one. And yes - they served great Pita bread. Next we got a Lebanese Potato Pie. Oh my god what a dish. Even the non-vegetarian company took their fair share from this. For the dessert we got a Baked Halawa Cheesecake. This was the BEST CHEESECAKE I've ever had - seriously guys you have to try this. One of the partners of Zizo was around and asked us 2 times if we were enjoying our food. It was great interacting with him and a nice gesture on his part as well to be around.

The decor is modern and contemporary and sets one at ease. The green Zizo beetle logo gets prominently highlighted though you may first mistake it for a mouse (with the wirey tail). I was fascinated by their big gas oven used for the baking and grilling. I couldn't help but get clicked along the lines of jars filled with varieties of pickled vegetables under the counter. Adds vibrancy and freshness to the service counter and would make for a fab gifting option ! I am delighted that my friends insisted we go there.

Shreyans Goenka,"Rated Lebanese cuisine has finally arrived in Delhi! It is easy to see why an establishment like Zizo has not come up before - the prohibitive cost of importing the specialty ingredients dissuades most restaurateurs and turns their 'lebanese' restaurants into adumbrates serving watery hummus, bland falafel and the ubiquitous shwarma. But the owners at Zizo have decided to take the plunge, face the steep import hurdles and serve delicious authentic Lebanese food. There is no skimping with the quality of the food when the Pita, Zaatar, Baklava etc. is all flown in to the country. Their well curated menu surpassed all expectations and whet my appetite to the point that I can hardly wait for them to serve a greater assortment of mezze. Though I must add that considering the extremely high quality of food and incommensurate low prices it is obvious that this system cannot be very profitable for the restaurant...but then again as a customer....I am not complaining!",Rated 5.0,59,379,??

The preparation was exquisite and the staff was quite courteous. The chef himself was on his toes to explain how to eat the dishes in the manner Lebanese have them. Prompt to take the feedback as well which I believe is a trend not very common amongst other restaurants where chefs are ducked behind the kitchen only.

At the name of pita bread they give you tawa roti that too over cooked. I had ordered chicken and hummas and it also had imli ki chutni. Also I had ordered one of the main course dishes which had chick peas and chicken. It tasted as if I was eating mattar kulcha on road side. The best was when we called the manager to complain about food he told us that there chef sits in Lebanon and he guides them over internet to prepare food which is so called Lebanese cuisine. Please do not waste your hard earned money on this place. We have lots of better places to eat in delhi.,Rated 1.0,2,20,??

Abhishek Bharara,"Rated Well to start with This is by far the most authentic Lebanese Restaurant I've been to in Delhi. Right from the interiors, the courtesy, the menu selections and the food itself has made me fall in love with Zizo, the Beetle. Had read recently about this place on a social forum and since I'm a die hard Mediterranean Food Fan, I had to try this one. Landed there around 10ish, fairly empty being a Thursday. Greeted week and seated. Ordered a strawberry lemonade, hummus chicken ras afour ( warm hummus topped with barbecued chicken in a tangy sauce), cheese n Zataar manoush ( a flat pizza with half cheese and half Zataar), the strawberry lemonade was also refreshing. The first course was too good to be true, so fresh n tasty, we hogged it all in minutes. Ready for the next course we decided to do away with the shawarma and ordered Chicken Mograbieh, which is grilled chicken on a bed of couscous with a gravy on the side, we also ordered classic hummus with pita bread. The highlight of the evening was the fresh, off the oven pita bread which is a rare find in delhi. I was awestruck at the size and taste of the pita bread and hummus. All on all the best meal I've had in recent times. Well not to forget it was very easy on the pocket too, we ordered 4 dishes n a drink and paid a mere 2000. Visiting again soon and taking my friends along. Kudos !!!",Rated 5.0,32,206,??
Misha Singh,"Rated I was planning to visit this place for long and I did two days back. However, I regret my decision now. I fell sick the day following the dinner at Zizo. I had placed an order for Chicken Shwarma and the dish for the day Lamb Man'oushe. I am not complaining about the portion of the dish or anything, or the taste but maybe the dips were old or the chicken or mutton was not fresh enough. Hence be careful !",Rated 1.0,26,38,??
Hams Nicole,Rated This was my Second Visit To Zizo and everything just exceeded my expectations. The ambience was really good. The food was good but the service was even better. The server really explained everything well and took very good care of us. The food had authentic flavours specially the Zaatar Manoushe was amazing. Would love to come back again and refresh ourself with an authentic blend of Lebanese food. Wish you success in near future...,Rated 4.5,4,22,??
Tarun Choudhary,"Rated +ives- Nice ambience and good space available. -Ives - the food was too bland. May be Lebanese is supposed to be like this. But it didn't suit my taste buds. Poor staff couldn't operate their credit card swipe machine and I had to go out to withdraw cash from an ATM. The staff was too hassled after the credit card machine fiasco (I offered 4 different cards, none worked) that they forgot to give me the change. Looking for an ATM machine after your bland dinner was such a put off. May be teething trouble for the new baby in town.",Rated 2.5,6,0,??
Manveen Kaur,"Rated Finally I found a place where I could relish lebanese food. For starters we ordered Fattoush Salad which had the perfect blend of mixed herbs and the dressing. Then we moved on to Spicy Falafe which was best to have with Pita Bread. We ordered hummus separately as they served tahini sauce with falafel. Spicy Man'oush had flat bread with spread of tomatoes and onions which we found was not very heavy in eating and soft at the same time. The ambiance is simply amazing. The brightly lit interiors and the seating arrangement makes it even more alluring to try this place. Last but not the least, their service is pretty fast which makes me give it a rating of 4.5/5!",Rated 4.5,2,56,??
Sidharth Bhan Gupta,"Rated 10 years back Lebanese cuisine was the next best thing to come to the Indian Market , Very promising and it was believed to be a cuisine which Indians will love and would set the market alive especially in terms of new cuisines coming to India. 10 years hence, we can proudly say that not just Lebanese (Sadly Lebanese is a wide term used by Indians for the Mediterranean cuisine sans the European part ofMediterranean )cuisine but all parts of the Mediterranean is being understood by the Indian market , if not by all , but slowly there has been an awareness to know and understand the cuisines in much more detail and hopefully that will lead to some authentic and genuine representations of foreign cuisines in india. So in past 10 years we have tried various kinds of shawarmas ( all the good , bad and the ugly) , Sheesh touks , kibbeh , rubianmeshwi (at very few places ) adinakebap , islimkebap , hummus , baba ghanoush , tabouleh , fatoush , pita bread and baklavas, these names ( may be barring a couple of them ) are now a household name in every foodies house. However, in my opinion , to talk of authentic places serving authentic Lebanese or Turkish or greek or Syrian or Libyan or even all of them combined arent even handful , and those which are(owing to expat chefs and international exposure) , are high on cost to get hooked on by an average foodie. And thus , al bake , your neighbourhoodshawarma guy , the mezze platters of HKV cafes , or an odd one dish restaurant serving falafel ( Good , bad & ugly versions ) were the only places which built our palate for the Lebanese cuisine. So few dishes stayed (heavilyindianised) on our mind and palate, and a wonderful dynamic cuisine for us became just a few dish wonder, and very few places which can actually justify the cuisine with or without being authentic. So Zizos experience for me was the one which really made me open up my heart and welcome them to our city , our country , our heart and most importantly welcome their food on our palate. I will be honest here , I will be very disappointed if this place doesnt get the reception it deserves , because its not merely a restaurant , its a representation of authentic , simple , no frills , no jazz , tasty , fresh cuisine from the countryside of Lebanon. The place and their effort to set up shop in India and Dillideserves a credit , and most of all , it is a pat on the back for Delhi foodies , as Delhi truly is the food capital of India. (Correct me if I am wrong) Zizos first outlet in India is at Iconic Connaught place ( Melting pot of foreign cuisines for decades) , located right opp. PVR plaza , the restaurant has two entries, one opp plaza next to khubchand meat supplier and the other one on the outer circle next to Hira Sweets. This is one thing, which makes a substantially large restaurant( 80 covers with four sections ) looks a little small. Which may or may not work in their favor? Dcor is marvelous,catchy, soothing and it gives a feel of excitement to a diner sitting there, there is lot to gaze here , even when you are in the washroom ( No pun intended). There are many things to talk about the dcor , but Ill let the pictures do the talking. Coming on food , I must say , if you are an explorer for new cuisine , please leave the perception of Lebanese cuisine and the taste of al bakes shawarma off from your palate. Think of this as a cuisine which serves you predominantly healthy food with fresh ingredients and flavours which bursts and create a party in your mouth. And you do not need mayonnaise with it. so well give you a dish by dish analysis. First thing first the pita bread : Freshly made in an oven especially imported to make fresh pita breads , the pictures should explain to you. It is quite the best Ive had. A perfect accompaniment to the cuisine. Lamb Manoushe : This was being tried to put on the menu and it was our first bite in the restaurant , it was introduced to us as a lamb pizza style dish , and as they say about the first impression , A new dish , flavorful meaty topping and the extra thin and rightly crispy base , woah !! I am a fan of this new pizza now. Without showing much excitement we head to our table. Fouad , Their CEO was with us guiding us with the cuisine and almost everyone in the restaurant too. The journey we had, could be attributed a lot to his way of explaining and giving you insights into the simple life of Lebanon and what goes around in a usual Lebanese kitchen and household. It wasnt just me, each guest was enthralled by his way of service and care shown, a service freak as I am,I was very impressed. Now back to food:Cheese and zattarmanoushe: Manoushe is like a thin pizza , which is usually rolled and consumed was spread with cheese and zattar ( they import most of their ingredients) which was neatly stuffed with Lebanese olive , tomatoes , mint and cucumbers. As I took a bite into it the flavors started to open up in my mouth and the olive was the hero here , it isnt the usual Spanish olive , which is stronger in flavour , Lebanese olive has a great long lasting flavor yet subtle , in am in love with these olive. Manoushe was soft and fresh veggies, cheese and herbs is a great combination. Food was gulped down with mulberry juice : Now this is novelty stuff, mulberry juice is again prepared with imported mulberry , and it is very costly , thus restaurant doesnt earn from this preparation , rather sells it as a novelty preparation, which I am sure will work for them. As the juice is heavenly. The other drink was strawberry lemonade which too was a hit. Better than most places serving mocktails, this place has got their drinks right. But I any day will grab my glass of mulberry juice and sit quietly sipping it.Moutabel : Basically eggplant and tahini , moutabel was nicely preapeed but not their best dish, the dish taste quite like an unspicedbharta , and thus that comparison makes it difficult for us to relish the preparation , as compared to other dishes on offer. I would recommend people to give it a miss and order more exciting preparations, unless you really have the palate for it. I love babaganoush , but this dish was more raw for my taste , so I couldnt do justice to it. Hummus : It is the best hummus I had. Period. Wait , sorry , I must mention , the hummus made by chef mashuk ( a visiting chef at Taj ) prepared for Mediterranean food festival , and that food was the best authentic Mediterranean cuisine I tried and fell in love with. Post that experience (which for me was more on kebaps) this hummus was the one I really liked. Amazingly smooth texture and the dish quite literally smiles at you.Pickled vegetables: very interesting and again nothing how we have had before (not me at least) the turnips gave me a taste similar to the kanji vegetables our naanis used to make. Its sour , it hits you and it leaves you asking for more. I havent had more vegetables in an hours time, ever in my life. Now comes another star of the evening , the falafel. The falafel are crispy , in fact unusually crispy as you take a bite it spreads on your palate and leaves a great taste and flavour, we had it in the traditional way as suggested by fouad , and loved it. I am certain, the vegetarians got a great place to try new dishes and cuisines, this cuisine is heavy on vegetarian preparations with authentic produce,soitsunignorable by vegetarians. We had chicken dibs rumman roll and the seeshtoukroll : Do not think of them as the HKV sheesh touk rolls , and look for flavorful wraps with sheesh touk& veggies. The dibs rumman is served with pomegranate molasses, and I must recommend everyone to try the pomegranate molasses , for someone who is a flavor addict and loves the texture , this sauce is the best thing , molasses is basically a reduction of the juices , hence it is concentrated flavour of pomegranate and it is bound to leave you asking for more. I did ask for more. And I am salivating as I am righting right now. Foul modammas : The chickpea dish which looks quite like the chole we get with cholekulche with chopped onions and tomatoes. This is the dish I loved the most, and I believe is something Indians are bound to love , try it with pita bread and its an interesting twist to what you would say is your chole aka matra. Not very spicy , though the menu says , and foud believed it would be spicy for us , but in the land of laalmaans and bhootjalokia this was like having a cheese cake. However, its just the right spice and flavour which can make you fall in love with it. The food at Zizo in my belief has lot for everyone to offer, from a pizza lover to someone who swears by subways , from vegetarians looking for exciting dishes , to hummus and pita lovers. And especially those who are foodies and look out for authentic cuisines and try and understand them in detail. For the latter kind , I would recommend you should talk to the chefs and fouad , who I am certain , would be more than happy to tell you tales about the cuisine and food habits , Thus Zizo food is not just for everyone , rather an experience in itself. Now , Indians are a sweet lovers , And desserts here are something one can try , even if you have meal anywhere in CP. The desserts are so good and so is the Turkish coffee or like I did , if you prefer , go for their orange blossom. Baked halawa cheese cake , is what I will recommend to all , it is the dessert I may choose to be in my Top 5 of all time. (Thats a sweet tooth telling you ). I will not say a word about it, I hardly could say anything, when I had it. So speechless. Chocolate Rice Pudding : Very bluntly put , it should only be Rice pudding and should loosethe chocolate. the rice pudding in itself is so tasty and has an amazing after taste which gets disturbed by the heavier flavour of chocolate , the combination is not right , individually the chocolate is fine , and the rice pudding on its own is really really good.Chocolate banana manoushe : It is as fouad say is every childs best dessert back in Lebanon . it has chocolate and banana wrapped in manoushe. I can imagine the kids all over the world are similar , and we adults are no different too. We wrapped it up in a jiffy. So I am beverage junkie , and I can tell you that you can heavily over eat at this place ( though the food is quite light) as the orange blossom also called as the caf blanc ( White coffee) will ease you down and enliven you. Very refreshing and subtle citrus flavor cleans your mind & palate and wakes up your soul, and makes you realize the wonderful meal you just had, is quite a worth. In spite of great job on setting up ,Zizo has challenges to ensure they sustain in indian market and choose a strategy best suited to them to be successful without compromising on the authenticity of the cuisine. I am certain , with the help of growing foodies culture in our city , there would be ample support from the community to help them set their footings , it would infact be beneficial for all. I am very thankfully to team Zizo for coming to India and showing us the lovely food that their country produces, which to be quite honest we had a different perception about. And thanks for providing me an opportunity to write after a long time from my soul about the food which touched my soul. After a series of mediocre experiences , I am happy I have something to recommend to you wholeheartedly. Do visit Zizo and anytime you may need help, call fouad at zizo or call me , and I will be happy to orient you about the cuisine, its important to support genuine efforts of people like Fouad and team Zizo , for us foodies to keep having new cuisine coming to our city and such global love spreading across the world.

Neeru Singh,"Rated Zizo is the newest addition to the list of Authentic Lebanese Restaurants in Delhi. Located at one of the most prime locations in the heart of the city, right opposite PVR Plaza. I have wanted to go to this place for sometime, as it looked quite nice from the outside. Today was my lucky day. The dcor of the place is really modern, minimalistic yet very stylish. White walls, cupboards get a hint of color through lamps, cushions etc. They play Lebanese music and that I think is pretty cool. The ambience is very cool, breezy and comfortable. The place is well lit up and the brown chairs are too nice to look at (Ive been told they are especially shipped from Dubai). The books by Barabara Massad (who also happens to be their food consultant) are kept on their display. You can have a look at the books if you like. The menu is very well designed but I hope its their introductory menu as I feel there should be more to offer in a place as big as Zizo. The staff is well aware about the food and its preparation. Rahul, one of the staff members was very kind to come and talk elaborately about the restaurant. He told us about how the restaurant got its theme A bite of simple life. The Beatle in the logo of Zizo holds great significance in the concept behind the restaurant. And that is also quite evident in the way menu is designed. After spending some time talking, reading and enjoying Pita croutons with a dip (complimentary), we placed the order. 1) Spicy Hummus with Pita bread and Mixed Pickles. 2) Chicken Shawarma Roll 3) Labne Garden Roll 4) Chocolate Banana Manoushe I must say that everything they served was fresh and tasted delectable. The freshness of Pita bread, the lightness of hummus, the crunch of the pickles, juicy chicken made me fall in love with the food. The presentation of the food was very chic and it looked every bit of Authentic Lebanese Food with Modern Twist. I have never had Shawarma that tasted so light and yummy. It didnt have mayonnaise oozing out or oil dripping at the end. The Pita was light, fluffy and it was evident that it was freshly baked. Labne Garden Roll is a vegetarians delight. The crunchy vegetables with the creamy sauce make it a must have and its very healthy also. We asked for pickles and we were given a generous quantity of mixed pickles. The Pitas were puffy and soft. The only thing I would mention that they should serve hummus with Shawarma or any other roll. Thats the combination thats served at most of restaurant serving Shawarma or Lebanese roll. Chocolate Banana Manoushe tasted good. My friends really liked it. Its made with Pita wrap, bananas and chocolate (I felt it was Nutella). The wrap is garnished with nuts. I felt it was overpriced. They say that they use only organic and imported ingredients, but (in my opinion) some of the prices can still be worked around. In all my experience was good and I really liked the effort the makers have put in it. Everything is carefully planned and executed. Even the bill holder not only looks good but talks about authenticity. Their biggest USP is that from the owner, conceptualizer, food consultant and Executive chef; everyone is Lebanese. And they are bringing their childhood memories to your table. That I feel shouldnt go wrong. I would give it thumbs up for the quality of food and for the playfulness. eatstory.in",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Saurabh Taneja,"Rated 2 roll and a serving of hummus. That was my first experience of Zizo. Authentic lebanese is hard to come by and in a place like Delhi people pass a lot of food for truly what it not believing that end customer is dumb enough not to figure out what is being served to him/her. Zizo is not such a place. Ordered the Chicken Shawarma Roll and the Dibs Roll. The Chicken Shawarma was yummy and seemed fresh. The Dibs roll on the other hand had a sauce which was too sour for my palette and if you guys are reading this please do something about it. The hummus was yum but had a sourish flavour to it which they can do without. The hummus was polished off within no time especially my 2.5 year old niece took to it gobbling up a few olives with the hummus. Good job guys, would be happier if the sourish tinge in both the dishes is taken out.",Rated 3.5,10,15,??

Rohini Gauba,"Rated Amongst all the legendary food stalls, restaurants,coffee shops and cafe's in CP, Zizo is a breath of fresh air due to the cuisine it is offering. With bright interiors and lightings, this place is definitely alluring more and more people. Salads- The mixed pickles are way different from what we might have even imagined and are fresh. The Lebanese green olives are distinctive in taste, unlike the ones we generally get in supermarkets here. The sole reason being that Zizo imports majority of their ingredients from Lebanon. Drinks- The hand pressed mint lemonade is very tangy but with the dash of mint, it is an ideal drink to wash down the food. The Mulberry Juice is what I would recommend, the best thing being that preservatives have not made their way to this place. Food- Hummus along with the freshly baked Pita bread has been slightly modified to suit the Indian palettes and since we like our food, spicy, another version called the Spicy Hummus has been added to their menu. The Falafels are crunchy and extremely flavourful. The Oriental leg of lamb is long grained rice cooked with spices and small pieces of lambs, more like our Indian Biryani with Lebanese taste and herbs. Zaatar Man'oushe looked like a pizza to me, it is a flat bread with herbs and spices and is a must have. Desserts- Chocolate banana Man'oushe is a wrap with a choclate spread inside and layers of bananas. This dessert is every child's dream. The Baked Halawa cheesecake is delicately flavoured and topped with some pistachios, again very different from the cheesecakes we would have ever tried here. Their Chocolate nutty tart is a bait and would surely make me go back to Zizo. They also serve their contemporary Baklava and is available for sale as well. Overall, my experience of dining at Zizo had been extremely flavourful. The staff is attentive and the service is quick and their green beetle make everything more impressive.

Bouquet Garni,"Rated CP is a place which i always love to roam around. So landed up to a new lebanese restaurant ZIZO. A very nice ambience, sitting place divided to three parts. Complimentary garlic croutons sticks were given along with the dip which was quite good, we ordered falafel served with fresh pita bread and sesame seed dip, portion of Hummus with chicken, Rumman Roll, and a chicken Shawarma. Falafel were up to the mark crisp from outside and well cooked from inside and pickle was really fresh and a perfect pita bread was complementing the whole dish a perfect HUMMUS with sauted chicken in clarified butter was really amazing texture of Hummus was like it has to be and spice which was sprinkled a bit on hummus as garnish was giving a very nice aroma of cinnamon. If we talk about rumman roll it was stuffed with juicy chicken and with a layer of Pomegranate Molasses which was giving a bit sour flavour in it but it good for me. Chicken shawarma was ok a bit dry for me and with same presentation as like as Rumman roll , if both were kept together you cant find the difference with almost same looks and garnish. Overall it was good experience except few things which the staff said they are working on it like dips were missing with both the rolls, same looks of both the dish, and one thing which i personally felt that somewhere the flavours of dishes were not have too much of difference.

Ankita,"Rated When you think of Lebanese the first thing, at least in my head, is the endless hole-in-the wall joints that serve Shawarma rolls or a caf that serves mezze platter with hummus, falafel and pita. And if you want something fancier- you need to head to more posh-restaurant, a five star maybe, to tuck into Baklava or bread flavored with Zatar. I have been bought in a family highly influenced by these flavors- my mum was bought up in the Gulf. So Zizo was on the list ever since everyone I see rave about it. Placed right next to Gola Sizzlers, Mr. B and I did no booking and headed straight in to try the Lebanon flavors. First off, the dcor is wonderful, no second thoughts here. The restaurant is HUGE. There is a lot of room to fill in a lot of people. Every corner is beautifully decked up- mason jars with colorful pickled vegetables, cookbooks on a bookshelf, attractive wall designs and cozy, comfortable furniture. We started with hand-pressed mint lemonade and mulberry juice. The lemonade was alright but the mulberry juice is something I recommend. The berries gave a refreshing kick and a slight tangy-sweet-kind-of-taste making it perfect summer drink. As we sipped, we were served the Hummus Chicken Ras Asfour. We did request to serve it with the spicy variety of hummus and the staff obliged. I am not sure if the chicken overpowered the spiciness of the hummus because we did not taste anything next to spicy. Nevertheless, the dish was delicious. The chicken was moist, the hummus good and the whole thing went well the fluffy warm fresh pita bread. To be honest, the hummus tastes okay- better than a lot of places but not the best I have had.Anyway to make the most of this dish, we order the Crusted Shankleesh Salad. This is basically a salad (lettuce, spinach and other greens) topped with Lebanese Cheese balls (homemade aged cheese rolled over spices) Dressed in a Rosewater Vinaigrette, the salad made me smacking my lips. The cheese does have a slight fermented odor but nothing disturbing. Black sesame, zatar, chilly and other spices made with cheesy-goodness heavenly. Crumb these up, mix it with the fresh greens, plop them into the pita bread, put some hummus and chicken- you have a dish you would love. We also got carried away and ordered the Oriental Leg of Lamb. Rice, lamb, nuts, yogurt and oriental gravy made to our table steaming hot. As we plated on Salted with Happiness plates and being awed by it, I decided to taste the pickle as well. Anyway the lamb dish is superb. The lamb was well-made, the seasoning perfect and the rice not at all mushy. The rich gravy along with cold yogurt and those crunchy nuts made the whole deal extremely delicious. We were full but I had to try the Baked Halawa Cheese Cake which I did. This was the perfect way to end the meal, in fact the best. We spooned into the soft, crumbly cheese layer down till the halawa layer, dipped into the sweetened floral scented syrup and literally went umm. The pistachios on the top (though I hate them) went really well here. However Mr. B wanted the halawa layer to be much thicker.Overall, I wouldn't say it is authentic but better than many places I have tried in Delhi. The dishes are contemporary and slightly tweaked for us to enjoy which is good thing. I would recommend this place for a healthier meal though I would like the menu to expand. The options for both, vegetarian and non-vegetarians, are limited. For a fresh breeze in the food world head over here. The service is good; staff friendly, well-informed and prompt; interiors spick-and-span; food delicious and prices pocket friendly. letstalkfood.in",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Being a regular to Fez, and having read the reviews for zizo, I was hoping for some really impressive food. But the experience was just average. It offers good ambience and comfortable seating. But the food just didn't leave us raving about it. The flavours are there but too little. The presentation also is too simple and the joy of mixing flavours on your own with different ingredients presented on the plate is missing. Very few options are available to vegetarians.

Dee Paul,"Rated Zizo is a new restaurant serving authentic Lebanese food. The outlet had opened up in the heart of the town in CP opposite PVR Plaza movie hall . The interiors are done up beautifully , bright and colourful. The service is good though the servers had issues explaining the dishes but then the senior stepped in and explained in detail. The food taste is authentic and the portion size of the dishes are good. The presentation is regular just like any fine dining restaraunt . The prices are reasonable and in line with the competitive restaurants. Coming to food , i had a Lebanese garden roll and Cheese & Zaatar along with hand pressed mint lemonade. The food taste is authentic lebanese, no complaints there and the lemonade too was refreshing. After the meal i ordered for Coffee which is suppose to be turkish coffee but what i got was hot clear water with a slice of orange in it, very disappointing coffee. Its a recommended place for authentic lebanese food , just avoid the coffee. The music being played was middle eastern sorts so that added to the whole feel of authenticity. They also have a small section on the first floor at the back side where they have some books having recipes for the lebanese food. The restaurant is spread on two floors, ground and first floor and both are done up very nicely.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Divya Arya,"Rated Zizo, is a newly opened restaurant which serves authentic lebanese cuisine in a modern way. Its only 2 weeks old, but has gained immense popularity. Maybe because there arent too many options when it comes to this cuisine, which is loved by many. Theres the evergreen Fez, in Chanakyapuri and a relatively new one named Faarsi, in Hauz Khas Village. But this new kid on the block has earned its place. PROS: So, I had both their traditional hummus and the spicy hummus, and without a doubt, theyre the best hummus Ive ever had. I prefer the spicy one though. Its not any normal hummus that is served at other restaurants. The spicy hummus has got bits of cucumber in it which makes it extremely refreshing. Their falafel again, is the best falafel in all of Delhi. Its crisp, crunchy, and doesnt have the overpowering taste of chickpeas. They have a wide variety of desserts as well, which stay true to their lebanese roots, but have been changed a bit, modernised quite creatively. The most intriguing dessert on the menu is the halwa cheesecake and the baklava. Also, they have a chocolate and banana manouch which is like a lebanese version of a crepe, which is the dessert I had and was suggested to me by the owner. I liked it, but I wish it had more chocolate. For beverages too, they dont have the usual options. Where else would you find mulberry juice and rose water juice on the menu? I had the strawberry lemonade which was sweet and sour, quite refreshing.And as for hospitality, the servers are quite courteous and suggest the best dishes on the menu. The owner goes up to every table and asks how the food was and gives his suggestions too. CONS: What I find to be lacking with this place is an expanded menu. I wish they add more vegetarian dishes such as a falafel roll, or maybe a grilled paneer roll. Also, I didn't order their pizza as the toppings were too basic, capsicum, onion and tomato. If I go to a restaurant, I wouldn't want to order this. And the music, wasn't exactly to my taste, authentic, but not something everyone would like. Overall, in terms of food, this place is a must visit!

The person waiting our table told us that the head chef is an award winning Lebanese chef, the main ingredients are all imported from Lebanon... And you know what, the food proved it! The spicy hummus and Falafels was excellent, so were the flavours of the Lebanese pizza, and the refreshing mint lime drink helped wash down the food perfectly and make you crave for more! The service was impeccable and staff was courteous. Since I am from Mumbai, I can only hope that Delhi-ites embrace Zizo with open arms so that they soon open shop in Mumbai too!",Rated 5.0,9,25,??
Chefsuparna,"Rated Finally I got the chance to visit the much hyped Zizo. And I have to say was not impressed as much as I wanted to be after reading all the reviews on variois food groups on various social networking sites. The ambiance was superb and very vibrant and brightly colored. The place was very brightly lit and had comfortable seating at two levels. Right next to gola sizzler where at least 20 people were waiting to get in, the place was full and not overflowing. But food was just passable as mediocre. We visited the outlet at 10 pm and most of the stuff on the menu was sold out. We ordered a spicy hummus. It ws the only saving grace, I felt, on the entire menu. The hummus was fresh and loaded with loads of peppers and olive oil. The pita served aling with the hummus was very good and was well made. May be the best pita in town. The shawarma roll and the shish tounk roll were just passable at the most. Both the rolls were filled with the pickled veggies and they were super sour and very big chunks, difficult to bite into and ultimately you end up with a super sour piece of pickle in your mouth and you are winking to avoid to bite into it. The lamb minoushe was nice but tasted more of eggs, maybe because the lamb mince mixture had eggs added into them. And when we wanted another one, it was sold out. The strawberry lemonade was ordered for the kids and we were told after 15 minutes that it is not available. We also tried the mulberry juice which came highly recommended by the owner. But it was not chilled and hence could have tasted better if chilled. The regular hummus was passable. The experience was mediocre at the best. I did expect more. B7t the saving grace were the servers who were very energetic and very agile and also attentive. Would think twice before visiting again.",Rated 3.0,50,37,??

Kunal Jai Singhani,"Rated Zizo has successfully put my search for an authentic Lebanese restaurant in Delhi to halt. There have been restaurants like Faarsi, Al Zaitoon and Pita pan serving Lebanese food for quite some time but Zizo delivers all the way from Lebanon... It's authenticity is its USP.. It is situated in the K Block, opposite PVR Plaza so we located it easily. It has two entrances - One is designed for the customers to be able to Dine in the restaurant and the other one is a take away zone (though there is a seating space too). The interiors of the restaurant has been done beautifully. The ground floor counter has a beautiful set of jarred pickled vegetables used in Lebanese food which adds up to the beauty of the counter that serves the refreshing drinks. On the first floor is a huge seating area where also resides the gigantic oven specially imported from Lebanon to maintain the authenticity of dishes like Zaatar. The manager on special request showed us around the place and it was great to know that Zizo is designed with an inspiration that comes straight from Lebanon itself..The chairs are imported from the Middle east which are supposed to last for more than 50 years, the pattern on the chairs are replicated on the wall...Zizo has some amazing pictures from Lebanon which I was told are clicked by the CEO himself. The food was up to the mark ...Zizo serves what it promises to serve...from the refreshing Mulberry Juice to the crisp Falafel with a perfect dip that accompanies it...everything on the menu is worth trying. Zizo is a must visit for all the Lebanese Lovers so give it a shot and let your taste buds experience a tint of something you've never experienced before. :)",Rated 5.0,1,44,??
Shreya Jalan,"Rated Delhiites, if Lebanese food is what you savour and have been deprived of all this while, your wait is over. I was more than glad to finally see an authentic Lebanese restaurant open in Delhi. My excitement led me to be one of their early customers and i was overwhelmed by the ambience and hospitality that i received. Not only the chef but the architecture, the equipments , furniture all is imported from Lebanon. The design is really thought over to give someone an entire feel of sitting in Lebanon and enjoying the mouth watering Lebanese food. I tried almost everything from the menu and i really don't know how to review it. It was heavenly!!! The falafel and Zatar broke all records. Don't remember the name of the salad that i tried but it was so fresh. Mulberry juice was a refreshing welcome. My friend who accompanied me was a non vegetarian who could not get over the chicken hummus and the shawrma . The authenticity of the food and the outburst of flavours was experienced at every bite. For desserts i tried chocolate banana manoush which did not disappoint me either. I tried something like that for the first time and would love to try it again. Overall Zizo was a complete dream come true for me and would be for all the Lebanese lovers out there. You are gonna love everything about the place be it the service, the feel, the food!!!",Rated 5.0,2,44,??
Rukshana Kapadia #The Culinary Commentator,Rated Zizo whose Chef is Maroun Chedid has just opened at Connaught Place a couple of weeks back. It serves up Lebanese and Mediterranean Cuisine which has become very popular and is a great addition to the already huge number of restaurants at CP. The decor is modern and contemporary lots of whites offset by reds and blues with the green ZIzo beetle logo prominently highlighted. They have a big gas oven that they use for the baking and grilling. The eye-catcher naturally is the lines of jars filled with varieties of pickled vegetables under the counter. Adds vibrancy and freshness to the service counter.... lovely ! I have in all honesty not eaten a full meal there but I am delighted that my friend and fellow foodie Nikhil insisted we stop by for coffee and dessert. We had a superb Baked Halwa Cheesecake and some of the best Turkish Coffee that I have had in ages. The Baked Halwa Cheesecake was super and we loved it ... the sweetness was perfectly balanced with the lovely strong Turkish Coffee we had ordered. The management also served up some delicious Hummus in a plain and chilli flavour which I was very impressed with .... loved both but the Chilli Hummus was really good. We ordered a Mulberry Juice to wash it all down which was refreshing and nice. Very impressed with whatever I had and looking forward to going back for more. facebook.com,Rated 4.0,664,5195,??

Prachi Goel,Rated Amazing food. The best lebanese you could get in Delhi for sure.,Rated 5.0,6,73,??
Aditi Arora,"Rated Super cool ambience... Loved the food too.. Kudos for the hummus! Baked halawa cheese cake is to die for... A must try!!! The best part is most of their vegetables, olive oil, dry fruits n flour is all imported... The taste of a raw tomato was also different and so fresh, as compared to the quality of raw stuff we get in delhi.",Rated 4.0,6,43,??
Shubhi Malik,"Rated From the minute you walk into the zizo, you feel you have taken a time capsule and just wondered into a homely yet trendy lebanese bistro. You cant help but notice the traditional oven in the corner that manned by busy buddies feeding it thin dough and pulling out piping hot lebanese pitta bread, the aroma of which is unmistakably heart warming. When i ordered Falafel, I was surprised by the crunch and combination that just have included fava beans and oriental spices in a mix. I have heard stories of what a great falafel tastes like but here I was experiencing it for the first time, and boy it was good! It was refreshing to have what seemed like organic mulberry juice, both cool and sweet enough to take you back to your childhood like picking wild berries from your back garden and consuming them with abundant. The kind staff of zizo when to great length in expelling every neon of every dish, how is it usually served and eaten and what accompanies it the best. The music playing in the background, the funny looking donkey with the vegetable basket make it look surreal. But when I come to think about it I realised this is exactly kind of place that can transfer me, my taste buds and my thoughts into another exotic land. Where do I book my ticket to Beirut?",Rated 5.0,1,79,??

Prerit Goel,"Rated The best Lebanese in town. Zataar, Foul, Hommous, Cafe Blanc!!! Everything par excellence... The ambience is so modern and chic! The Deli sells books by famous Lebanese author and also the best Baklawa in town. Most of the vegetables are imported. The desserts are a must try too. I would recommend the Cheese cake and the chocolate rice pudding.",Rated 5.0,9,128,??
Karan,"Rated The restaurant serves Lebanese and Mediterranean food. I am open to trying new places and Zizo is the new talk of the town. The pricing is decent. I tried the bean stew which was decent. They also served us some shankleesh salad which pleased my wife very much. It is just the kind of thing she adores. The manaoush was too good to be true. We finished all of it and were really pleased with it. The hummus was amazing too, I will go back just for the hummus because I liked it so much. Vegetarians will really like this place because they would have many many options at this restaurant!",Rated 3.5,110,844,??
