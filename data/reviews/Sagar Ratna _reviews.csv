Shikha, This sagar ratna is very old restaurant serving delicious dahi vada & scrumptious south Indian food. This place is loosing its charm due to poor service & dull ambiance. Average place to visit., 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Ashish Sarma," The sofas are torn... Not well maintained. We took one couch that looked OK.. But then were asked to vacate it since it was reserved - even though there was no sign placed on the table that indicated reservation. The waiter's attitude was below the standards of a supposedly good restaurant chain. The food is overpriced for the quality and quantity... There is a minimum standard of presentation that is expected but was not there. Overall an avoidable experience, specially the CP outlet... I have heard the other outlets are good and hence was hugely disappointed coming to this one.", 1.0,1,0,??
Toshi Vasistha," Visited this place recently, because many people referred. Biggest Disappointment. I just love South Indian Cuisines, but what they served was just pathetic. We ordered Mysore Masala Dosa, not at all crispy, served cold and the filling was bland. The Idlis were hard, served cold, the sambhar was more like rasam in terms of consistency , and coconut chutney was ridiculous. Only one item served was fine and that was Filter Coffee. Very bad place, bad food, slow service.", 1.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Jasmeet Singh," This outlet famous for its versatile southy food has always been my favourite stop for appetite. This tym, ordered mini idlies dipped in sambhar , schezwan noodles and masala tea. There are flavoured idlies as well but we ordered the plain ones. Their taste has always been nice and the staff always welcome the advises.", 3.5,38,75,??
Abilash Baskaran," One of those places that deserved to claim they serve multi cuisine. On my one day pit stop at NCR headed here for a quick dinner in CP. The company I had wanted some ""home food"" and this place sounded safe. The only similarity between Tamil and north Indian cuisine is that they both screw up the other cuisine big time. Don't trust me, try out some panneer tikki from a leading south Indian chain in south. The ambiance was good to seat a 70 people in the ground floor and another 50 in the first. Not great zeal over decors. They were simple and elegant, good lighting, efficient space management. This sure shows they are pro in what they deal with. Service was fast. Waiters know the food (obviously) and are good enough to suggest. Food- Masala dosa is good. You hear that from a Tamil guy, you go try that masala dosa. Sambar was a little off track, not sure where it exactly differed, edible. Chutnies were spot on. Rotis and subjis were decent. I had better ones in the dhabas of chandni chowk earlier that day, they stand no chance in comparing. Total damage for an averagely full meal for three persons was a 600 bucks change. For the south Indian food they serve, they can charge so much. PS- We did get some at home feel after that masala dosa anyways.", 4.0,83,416,??
Neha Singh," South Indian cuisine is one of the lightest food to eat on any day and is also one of my favorites . Whenever one thinks of eating good south Indian food only sarvanna bhavan and sagar ratna (close competitors) come to anyone's mind ; with the former being slightly better of the two in terms of authenticity. Sagar ratna has bit north.Indianised itself in its offerings and the tastes has been twisted accordingly to suit to the localites here . This outlet is located in block K in outer circle and is easy to access from metro station gate number 2/3 as well . Spaced over two floors , interiors are done subtly to depict the simplicity of South India. Wooden furniture , ample lyting , few painting on walls .... And the interiors are done . They offer not just south Indian food , but also north Indian and Chinese . So its a complete restra and not an exclusive south Indian one like sarvanna , with their speciality being south Indian ofcourse . I have visited this outlet quite a number of times now and have tried almost everything that this place has to offer . My personal favorites here are rava Masala dosa , Mysore dosa , filter coffee and dahi vada . On my last visit I tried their vegetable cheeze dosa in which dosa was Stuffed with lots of cheeze and capsicum , carrot etc . The taste was bit bland and it wasn't even going well with the chutneys and sambhar served and hence was a disappointment. It's not just south Indian food , their north Indian offerings are also good to taste . What stands out here for this place is Chinese combo - reasonable , spicy , flavorful and ample quantity ; this one is definitely worth the price . What I personally love about sagar ratna is that they keep introducing new types of dosas on monthly basis and keep improvising on their menu regularly . Recently they are celebrating podi fest and the offerings are really great and I will be visiting them soon to try them. Service is quick , staff is courteous and pricing is decent too . Worth a try !!", 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Akash Shah," Worst dining experience. Have tried Sagar ratna at other outlets and never expected such food. There was a huge waiting outside, was excited for the food but all in vain. Mysore masala dosa was as soft as roti and served cold. Podi idli was a disaster. Sambhar was as thick as rasam (and rasam was out of stock and I wonder why). Tried pesarattu mla dosa for the first time, now this actually tastes this why or just prepared badly as other items. Only well served items were madras idli fry, hot n crisp and sweet lime soda. I hope I just ended up here on a bad bad n food is not bad on other days. Needs a lot of improvement.", 2.0,43,126,??

Sachin Kumar, Disappointment of epic proportions. I frequently go sarvan bhawan for south Indian food but unfortunately I thought of trying out this place last night. There was some podi feast going on so we ordered podi idlis because the photo in the menu looked so delicious. But when the real idlis came the excitement was gone. They tasted nothing like what I had expected. The fried idlis where good. We ordered Mysore masala dosa and pessarattu dosa. Both were below mark. The sambhar was more like rasam in terms of consistency. Will never go there again., 1.5,16,67,??

PRAMOD," Sagar Ratna is a good name in Delhi NCR for their south Indian food items and north Indian food also....I was visiting first time to any sagar ratna restaurant.So I went to this outlet in C.P. with my 2 other friends who are from South India andhra Pradesh and I also have lived there in Andhra Pradesh for more than 8 years.So iam too much familiar with all the taste and items of South India.Biryani,idli,dosa,vada,upma,uttapam etc. So after we went there there was a huge rush as it was Saturday of October month and we waited more than half an hour for our number.Space is good 2 floors are there.We got seats in the top floor.And our order was as follows: Paneer,lemon rice,mixed raita,butter naan and papad.... Now coming to the waiting time after we order.The person who took the order told us that it will take more than 20 minutes to bring our food.So I asked him to give the papads first and you will not believe they took more than 20 minutes to deliver me papads...And food it came nearly after 40 minutes....So we were upset with the time they took for bringing us the food....coming to cleanliness they are maintaining it nicely but they must make the hand wash area big there as it is too much small in the top floor and it brings problem to all the people waiting for hand wash as there is space to stand for only 1 person who would be washing his/her hands.No other person can even stand up in that small place.... Lemon rice was above average.Naans were perfect and same was with mixed raita and paneer was also good..... So my verdict is that this SAGAR RATNA restaurant is not up to the verdict and name it has in other locations in Delhi NCR.....They must cooperate nicely with their customers as we asked them nearly 7-8 times how much time it will take for our food to come.....So please SAGAR RATNA management team.... Maintain your C.P. branch perfectly as you are maintaining it in other locations......", 3.5,7,0,??
Daksh Soni, Its USP is its ambience. The place is so much neat and clean. A total treat for the eyes and for the health as well. The Rawa Masala Dosa was sumptuous and the Rawa Idli was also tasty.

Food Love," Whenever I get the craving to eat some south Indian food, a name immediately comes to my mind which is none other than sagarratna. I have been to their C.P branch and it was crowded so much that I had to wait for a good half an hour. The effect of which was my appetite reduced to some level till my order arrived. The food I ordered was a sagarratna platter and it turned out to be just okay. Only amazing thing about this restaurant is its ambience and cleanliness.", 2.5,20,5,??

RishWish," The quality of the food here has definitely changed a lot over the years but this restaurant continues to serve decent South Indian food. I have tried North Indian here just once and it was the usual punjabi palette, nothing extraordinary. It's funny that the place also offers Chinese cuisine which I haven't and probably won't bother to try. Below are pictures of Rasam (piping hot and richly flavored), Mysore Masala Dosa (all time favourite), Rava Masala Dosa (decent enough but a bit too oily) served with Coconut chutney (served cold and fresh) and Sambar (okay-ish).", 3.5,73,235,??

Kunal Handa," Had a pretty bad experience in this outlet. Visited sagar Ratna on 17 October 2015 for the first time in cp and the service was pathetic. Normal waiting time outside the venue was 20 mins and then the service time was nearly an hour, where we had to leave when one of the items was still pending to be served. The senior staff on the floor was mismanaged and even after reminding for 10 times the pending item was not delivered. Really Sarvana Bhavan has maintained high standards and sagar Ratna is losing its touch in locality. A shocking experience and that too when they advertise for Navratra food and our order was for Navratra food.", 1.0,1,8,??
Samjyor Lepcha," Nice staff, but it's quite stuffy then the other outlets. The service was very good, got our food within 5 minutes. We had a Sagar Ratna special thali, veg schezwan noodles, and masala dosa. They served us the thali with different side dishes, and they were so good. I fell on love with the garlic chutney. The schezwan noodles was satisfactory, but it was very oily. The dosa was good too, bit not the best I had till now. Great service guys and keep up the good work. ?", 4.0,34,54,??

Ankit Das," One of my friends recommended sagarratna to me so i visited their outlet at CP with my circle of friends for a casual thursday night dinner. The food wasn't as delicious as everybody claimed it would be and was about average. I tried finger chips ,lacchaparantha and sagarratnaspcl. I think it is a very economical choice and should be considered for full family gatherings not otherwise. I might visit again but maybe to some other spacious and well lit outlet.", 2.5,23,203,??
Charu Jagga," Sagarratna is a high end restaurant name in Delhi. They are like the rulers of restaurant chains because they have maximum number of customers. Everyone i know has visited one or more outlets. I recently tres passed their outlet in CP. The interior was sober and so was the service. I tried vada noodles and Manchurian. The manchurian was first-class and a delicacy to savor. But both vada and noodles were a disappointment. The prices were fine but they need instrust the chef on indian dishes. Because everything a little non-indian is perfect to taste. The prices aren't high either. The next time i visit , i'll try something with a little more 'non-indian' in it.", 3.0,19,157,??
Daksha Patel," I am a street food fanatic and not extremely picky about a place's interior or the customer care. All that matters to me is good food.

Their mix of classy restaurant menu and adverse diversity in food choices makes it highly recommendable. Everyone should visit one of their outlets.", 4.0,20,183,??

Raghav D. Soni, Good wholesome food. Service is quick. Sambhar is delicious. Good quality and fresh ingredients are used. Butter Masala Dosa is tasty. The red onion and tomato chutney is better than many other South Indian Restaurants in New Delhi. The coconut chutney is fresh and not watery. Dahi Vada is filling.

Radhika Sharma," Situated in CP Inner circle. Sagar Ratna is the South Indian restaurant. Think of south indian food sagar ratna is one of the few names that come in your mind. The interiors are basic, nothing great to keep you hooked. The service is fine. But only thing that irritates is gets too congested at times.. Rava Masala dosa, veg uttapam, fried Idlis are my favourites and would like to recommend to all. I didnt like their sambhar and have never tried their north Indian. I personally feel in terms of food there are dishes that taste better at other south indian outlets like sarvana bhawan. Please keep up with the quality. Otherwise i had a good time. Would definitely go back to try their north Indian cuisine.", 4.0,3,259,??

Naveen Malik," This place is a second home for me if i talk about south Indian food, have been going from last 6 year and I always loved it. Their quality and taste has not changed over the years. You must try their Upma, Utappam, lemon rice, tomato rice(rice served with raita, papad and extra red chutney which you won't find anywhere easily). They serve north Indian as well which tastes better than some north India restaurant. In beverages I loved their fresh lime soda, chocolate milkshake and south Indian filter coffee.", 5.0,22,24,??

While waiting for one of my friend my love for a typical South Indian Masala Dosa woke up once again. And Sagar Ratna was the first name which came in my mind. I went and without even looking at the menu placed a order for Masala Dosa. This was my 1st time here so I was definitely trying to compare it with the typical Dosa's I have had in Hyderabad. My order was on my table with in 5 minutes, the dosa was crispy and coconut chutney was brilliant as well. The sambhar could have been a bit better with the smaller slice of veggies.

But this joint proved to be an utter disappointment. The ambience was below average..There was rarely any space to walk, it was congested. The staff was extremely slow and they took ages to serve the food. The sambar was horrible.

But we did manage to find a table. The interiors are very simple as with all the Sagar Ratna outlets. We ordered one Plain Dosa,one masala dosa,one rava onion masala dosa, one madras fried idlis, 2 tea and one lassi. Loved the dosas. But the surprise was the madras fried idlis. My parents were a bit tentative about trying the fried idlis. But once they did, they couldn't stop but take 2-3 servings. The chai was okayish and the lassi was thick and good.

We ordered a Rava Mysore Paneer Dosa and a Mixed Vegetable Uthhapam, and requested the waiter to hurry up our order. To our absolute delight the food was served within 10 minutes. The preparation is excellent. I particularly like the gunpowder chutney and dhaniya pudina chutney they serve with the dosa, which is why I prefer this place over Sarvana bhawan. Moreover, they refill the water glasses without having to ask for it, a very a nice and warm gesture which you will rarely find at many other restaurants. The extra chutneys and sambhar are also served promptly, without having to ask. This i feel is the USP of this place. Within half an hour we were done with our lunch. Its also value for money. Sagar Ratna is to South Indian food what Mc Donalds is to burgers both in terms of prices and prompt service.", 4.5,11,15,??

Rishabh Sood," Sagar Ratna is a place which is known for south indian cuisine. I tried the dosa, uttapam both were good and filling. I had also ordered the fried idli, which the waiter said that they will get in 20 minutes as it takes time. So they served the rest of the meal. After a wait of 20 mins and a four times reminder, I received the so-called idli fries, and not fried idli. The dish was like fried fish or potato. On asking why did they not serve the actual order, they said that it was over. We cancelled the fried idli order and paid for the dosa and uttapam only. Sambhar taste was average.", 3.0,11,15,??

You should try butter milk as well. We were served with some south Indian Sweet that tasted like North Indian Halwa. This is just a normal place with an ambience similar to Railway Stations.

Dinesh Singh, Just average. Rava Dosa was passable and so was Halwa. Seating is average and cutlery are reminiscent of bygone era. Need to pull up their socks. Probably I am not much into South Indian cuisine. But still the taste was just okay. The serving of sambhar in tiny bowl was simply put off. Probably good for family who are looking for veg dining. But it's no reason to be mediocre. Compared to tastefully done up South Indian cuisine restaurants like 'Southies' in Bangalore it's on thin ice, 2.5,14,18,??

Tanya Jain, Sagar Ratna is a very popular chain. I guess the Connaught place outlet was the very first one I ever visited. (Don't know how I misses on reviewing it but here I am) Almost 3-4 years back I went here for the first time. Undoubtedly a very pleasing south indian meal I had here. Been to this outlet numerous times after that in all these years and there are no doubts about thinking how the food is going to be. Even the menu is on mt tips and I know what I have to order. Its always a fulfilling meal here within very nominal prices. Sagar Ratna is a respite when in need of good vegetarian meal.

Devashish Pareek," Entering sagar ratna gives u a feel of those old times where normal everyday meal was enjoyed. Defintly looking around its ambience suited the food being served. Defintly a good hangout over breakfast,lunch,dinner with family. I tried its south indian thali. Though they provided a variety of salty n sweet stuff but it was okay. Not the best south indian serving resto around. One thing which i really liked was its service. My sister ordered a special dosa but it was not tasting that good. The manager did seem to over hear us and got the food change that instant. They certainly want to give a good experience n retain its customer. Sagar ratna please concentrate more on south indian food.????", 3.0,8,2,??

I always loved the taste of sambhar of defence colony. But this outlet lacked the taste and essence of THE SAGAR RATNA! Thali was also disappointing.

Akanksha," For the people who are very much familiar to the 'authentic' south indian food, dining at CP's Sagar Ratna will be futile. Ambience is average not very fancy or down-graded. When it comes to food, my opinion differs alot. With a very fancy menu the food is quite bland. The exoticity of Exotic veg utthapam remains just on the card and fails to come down on your platter. Onion dosa is nice but not up-to-the-mark. Chutnies are great to taste. The major let down is the very much fantisised and costly 'the filter coffee'. Priced at 55 bucks, the coffee is the spoiler.

I have not tried the home delivery from sagar ratna, but if i ever feel like eating sagar ratna food, I definitely would try our the home delivery than going to the congested, suffocating, confused place or rather would give it a miss as there are a lot of options in same location.

We were looking for a quick serve and delicious food outlet and thought this place would suit the bill perfectly. We were surprised by the new fusion dosas on the menu. We ordered all five (hot garlic, achari, spring roll and panner masala) in addition to good old ghee roast dosa, madras fries and crispy vadas. The hot garlic dosa was good and the achari was okay too. The paneer dosa was light on the paneer and the spring roll dosa was too chinese for my traditional tastes. The madras fries were phenomenal and the vada too. The chocolate dosa was good too. We finished with nice hot chai and filter coffee. We were stuffed in the end but the bill was very easy on our pockets. Glad to have been reacquainted with this familiar outlet. Will visit again and order in too.", 4.0,67,216,??
Tanu Aggarwal," Sagar Ratna has always been known best for its South Indian food, but in my opinion its now getting down in terms of standards and experience previously it was known for. This restaurant does not even serve only south Indian but also Punjabi food as well as little of Chinese. It has a good seating capacity. Ambiance is just average as well as furniture. On My last visit here I felt very dull and lazy environment. Food was average. Not a good choice if you wish a fine and authentic south indian delight. The dosas were below average in terms of taste and there was no sync with the stuffing. The sambar tasted ordinary as if it was made using the ready to use mix. We ordered a couple of Cheese dosas and to our amazement, it came with stuffed mozzarella cheese. We couldn't finish even half of it. The idlis tasted as if they weren't freshly cooked. They charged like a million bucks with all the added taxes and all. All that money was a sheer wastage since nothing was upto the mark. My Tip: Stay away unless there is an emergency food pang.", 2.0,187,1125,??
Yash Verma," last Tuesday I've been there with bunch of my buddies and time i enter i was not happy the interior looks rubbish and the most disgusting food I've ever ate their,if i compare to def col food..the staff was not known about the food they are serving, I've ordered dal gharwali and their dosas many of us want to try their south Indian because of obvious reason.. but dosa are like uncooked white from both side wen we were experiencing this all shit, I've told the server to get me your manager, first of all the manager denied to come & wen he came he was starring at us like we had did something wrong,he was talking so much in anger anyways i ask him for replacement for the food which was uncooked he told us that ""BHAIYA DOSA AISE HI HOTA HAI"" i was so angered by hearing this answer wen i ask his senior number he denied and said that am the senior here he was way arrogant and manner less, i don't understand why sagar ratna spoiling there image by hiring these kind of manager and staff... they've nil skills in terms of being to be a manager, his name is AMIT YADAV, i suggest to senior authorities of sagar ratna to take some strict action. so that he won't behave the way he behaved with us, after all your in cp where many well educated people come just to have food with good ambiance and service & i will never suggest to visit cp sagar ratna.", 1.0,1,2,??

Ajit Vikram Bhargava," The Outlet and Layout The Sagar Ratna at K block Connaught Place by fat the best outlet of theirs I have been to.It is copious and has 2 levels of seating arrangement.It is there in the K block opposite to the road going towards the Minto Road.( kakke the Hotel).You can reach sagar ratna if you take Block F exit through Metro or you park your car at the odeon parking. Food The food Is exceedingly fresh and scrumptious.It is very well prepared with Few hiccups when there is lot of rush,you can expect the quality to go down by few notches but not much which shows there ability to fully satisfy their customers.I have tried mostly everything provided by sagar ratna including their north indian thali and dahi.The utthapams and dosas with vada and idli are excellent and perfect for foodie's Staff: The floor managers are fine.they are prompt and give you attention.take the order and rivert back to the counter to get it started but the waiters who serve the food are very low on morale it seems.They are tight faced and look very mundane with no smile on their faces.It seems they are unhappy and irritated. Prices: the best part,the prices are very reasonable.It is the best thing about sagar ratna.infact all sagar ratnas. Decor: They can do with some changing.the Place needs a revamp.but like most south indian restaurant their focus is more on the quality of the food.So i do not mind that but if you do something to the decor it will be great. Overall I give it 4 stars for the above mentioned reasons and deduct 1 star for decor!", 4.0,35,97,??
Dhairya Gulati," During my college days, I had heard from some people that Sagar Ratna serves one of the best South Indian food in Delhi. On visiting the place I had expectations that it won't disappoint. I got the opportunity to try some dishes as it was a friend's treat and our group was big. The ambiance was ordinary but that was expected, however, the service was too slow and the staff didn't seem courteous. We tried their Masala Dosa which was so ordinary and the sambhar was watery, some of us had to left it at the end. Rava Dosa also turned out to be below the mark. Their Uttapam didn't had the taste which is expected from the dish. The Idlis were good though but that doesn't make the overall experience even a bit better. I would recommend South Indian food lovers to opt for other restaurants in Delhi and if CP is the location, Saravana Bhavan is the right place for you.", 2.0,50,400,??
Seema Bhati," Although I am not the fond of the south Indian food but I can give company who likes it very much. Once I joined one of the my friends, south Indian food lover, at sagar ratna, CP, New Delhi. As CP is known for its crowd, the restaurant is also known for the same. During my first visit, We waited almost one hour to join the sagar ratna crowd for lunch. It was just feeling like we are sitting in a hostel mess. It was full rush there. sitting arrangements are also so congested. It can be a bad selection for first meeting and date. Waiters will attend you once at your first order only after that you have to call them every time. Food is good. We ordered the full south Indian thali. But in comparison to naivedyam, I didn`t find it so good. Next time I would like to avoid to go there. As your stomach needs are directly connected to ambience and service, specially when you are in a restaurant. (As I Suppose).", 3.5,4,0,??

Rishabh Kumar, On a Sunday evening after collecting someone we finally decided to eat at Sagar Ratna. As we entered i saw it's hot and boring no music and loud noises of people talking and maybe of utensils. After sitting for 15 minutes waiter served us water and after 15-30 minutes the waiter took our orders. Food took 30 minutes to reach us and most of it was good. Must come for food if your free and not in hurry. ., 2.5,33,20,??
Rahool Machal," Good food, decent ambiance amazing service and polite waiters - what else do you want from restaurant and Sagar Ratna, Connaguht Place, Delhi doesn't disappoint you at all. Music could be a bit of a let down but you can ignore it since the soothing fragrance keeps you distracted (it's not very audible anyways *shrugs*). A perfect place for families, couples, client meetings and Dosa lovers... and not to forget the tasty, delightful and refreshing drinks which make you wanna come back again and again... but not too much or else it wouldn't be too charming to you anymore.", 4.0,3,42,??
Niharika.Loves.To.Eat," There were way more cons to this restaurant that pros. All Sagar Ratnas in the city serve a consistent flavor and portion size at a nominal fixed price. However, the service and ambience differ. Sagar Ratna, Defence Colony, has a courteous and responsive staff and hygienic tables, chairs, walls, floors and everything else. But Sagar Ratna, Connaught Place lacks all of it. It is very crowded during daytime and so finding a table is a pain. However, if there aren't any vacant tables then a server or a staff member should let us know so that one doesn't have to wait for 25 minutes. I could've just left. The tables and chairs are full of dirt. Never have they been dusted. Further, when you take a table and expect one of the servers to come and clean it up, he doesn't come. Instead, someone comes to take your order without noticing that you've been sitting on crumbs and gravies! I do understand the culture of the cuisine to throw you out as soon as you are done. A crowded place like this one should rotate tables as fast as they can. However, don't pass me the bill when I am eating ! Sheesh. Further, discovering hair in food is bad. It can just put you off anything edible and that is what happened. Urgh. And they did not have paan. How can they not have that little paan that I love to have after every South Indian meal? It is like breaking a law, right? Bad experience.", 2.5,441,6711,??
Devansh Gilani," Sagar ratna has always been famous for its south indian food which are no doubt delicious.The ambiance of this particular branch didnt satisfied me,the place was a little crowded with a lot of tables and chairs.The food they offered was undoubtly delicious and true south indian style.The variety of food other than the south indian is shocking,they have a whole lot of menu like that of a north indian restaurant or a chinese joint and many of the dishes I have tasted are good.

P.S. - Do try the dry fruit shake... ask for it even if you don't find it on the menu card.", 4.0,15,15,??
D.," It was on the last day in India when I had dinner at this wonderful place. I was in a slightly uncomfortable situation: My flight was leaving only at 2am, I was partially sick with a flu, I was running out of money and I had still to write about 20 postcards back home. So, I was desperately looking for a place where I could just sit down, relax, have an affordable dinner and get my postcard job done. By chance, I ended up at the Sagar Ratna at Connaught Circus and I was amazed by what they offered to me: - The food was delicious, much in quantity and could still be paid with my remaining 500 INR. - The service was quick and very friendly. They even provided tape and scissors for me as I had to refurbish some postcards. - The restaurant manager did not say a word even if I was blocking as a single person a table for four persons (due to my postcard writing activities) for about 2 hours 30 minutes and there were people lining up outside. - I asked for hot water in order to use some drugs and they immediately provided it without any charge. I was treated in such a nice and warm way even if I clearly did not look like a high-potential customer and also did not behave like this (rather like a backpacker with little money). So I was deeply impressed by the quality in service, food and drinks they provided to me. Finally, the restaurant manager that night (I think that his name was Rajad or something similar) even helped me to find a reliable taxi to get back to the airport. He called several taxi companies, but none of them could send a taxi within 10 minutes. In the end, he went out with me on his own, called another taxi station with his private cell phone and waited for me till I got safe on my taxi ride. He is really a person that cares about his customers. Thank you very much for this wonderful experience! The next time I will be in Delhi I will come back for sure! ----- 06 Jan, 2013 ----- Sorry for the double post. This has not been done intentionally.", 5.0,2,2,??

VacationInIndia," On one of my reviews about Sagar Ratna in Indrapuram, it was fantastic. This place in CP which is next door to Nirulas on the outer ring road was dirty, dirty as hell. Their was black dust all over the light fittings. The tables were sticky and filthy. We were so dissapointed that Sagar Ratna who we loved so much has dropped points at this outlet. We got lime soda in the end which was fantastic and refreshing but we left empty stomached. Do not get the sweet paan from this place either which is pre made at the counter. To make things worse, the customer service in this place was rude to the point where I will be contacting their head office in regards to this matter. If you want dosa at a Sagar Ratna then go to the big bright indrapuram branch instead.", 2.0,81,367,??
Praveen Gupta," This Outlet of SagarRatna is located on the Outer circle near PVR Plaza. It is easily approachable from New Delhi Railway Station. This place has got good Decor, the staff is courteous and looks after your needs with care and of course, the tasty food. I liked their Coconut Chutni and the other ones more, rather than Dosas and Idlis. I clearly remember, I kept on asking for more coconut chutney and Green chutney as they were so yummy and I could feel the aroma properly. Hope to get there soon.", 3.0,187,850,??
Rohan," The name suggested that Sagar Ratna is a South Indian specialty restaurant and I entered the restaurant with high levels of expectations. The sambar was awful and the worst part is that even the wadas did not have the freshness as well. The aloo sabzi I ordered did not have properly cooked potatoes and even was barely sauted. The menu is heavily priced as well. Over all the staff was good but without real good quality and taste, I feel being at Sagar ratna is a waste.", 1.0,2,6,??
