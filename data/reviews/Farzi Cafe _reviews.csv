Ishani Agarwal,"Rated I had heard a lot of good reviews about Farzi from my friends who went to the 'cyber hub' one. So when I was in CP I decided to try this new outlet. The entrance is good. Music, crowd, lighting all create a good atmosphere. We even had to wait for half hour because of the rush. Food- we we're ordering something else but our server suggested totally 2 different dishes instead. And I must say, both of them turned out to be delicious! It was 'Dal Chawal' something. And really tasty. It was not what you'd expect out of a dal chawal dish :D Drinks- 'Kolaveri Bunta' which was a Rum based drink. It was good but a lil strong. Overall, the staff was also totally good.",Rated 4.0,17,23,??
Ajit Ajmani,"Rated So farzi cafe is now in cp. Went there on friday night. Jaz Dhami was performing live. The place was decently packed. But the vibe was not that great. I guess something was wrong with their sound systems. Was spoiling the whole mood. Coming now their forte The food. Yes, undoubtedly the food is great. We had braised lamb chops and lamb with malabar parantha. Both tasted good though lamb curry ws on the sweeter side. Liquor variety ws less. We ordered for absolut, jim beam , glenfidditich . They all werent available. So we chose oder options Ambience is minimalistic with a bar in the entrance. The bar looks good. The stage set up is good for events. Sitting is comfortable. Hookah tables are at one corner. They only serve hookahs dere nt in the middle. Service is slow. Have to ask for a couple of times for drinks and food. But staff is courteous. Will go again jus for food nt for a nightlife experience.",Rated 3.5,5,114,??
Dolker Bhotia,Rated The good things about this place : 1. The food is extremely tasty and feels it is made with a lot of quality. We had the fried prawns and chicken both were good but the prawns was too good and worth every bite . 2. The freshness of trying out new dishes is good as the cafe is all about experiments with the standard food and drinks. 3. The staff was very customer friendly The only bad thing is that the quantity of the food it quite less .,Rated 4.0,2,2,??

Dinesh Seamen Bahrani,"Rated Cp Farzi a recently opened place, had the hype surrounded for all the right reasons. Been here god knows how many times and have had almost everything they have to offer Drinks are priced very competively and they have a decent 'Molecular' cocktail menu. Must have for food -- Dilli Pork Belly, All their Appam dishes and a special shoutout to their 5-7 slot of mini tapas menu. Cashew Idlis, Mutton Boti all are great to taste. Do try their Kahlua lollipops!!! Just a little concern most of the times ive been here the food was served luke warm. Even though the service is super fast, some reason the food wasnt very hot. otherwie good job guy, cant wait for Masala Bar!",Rated 4.0,35,150,??
Maninder,"Rated cosy place with nice interiors. limited food menu especially for vegetarians. more than the taste of the food which was good i was stunned by their service standards. super quick service, well trained, smart looking and well informed staff. did not like santa banta drink and especially its quantity. mojito was good and so was red wine sangria. kudos to the service staff. keep it up.",Rated 4.5,2,1,??
Amar Sirohi,"Rated So many good reviews, such a highly rated place, talk of the town since it opened..Farzi cafe..i have thought of a much better experience than what i had today on my first visit here. The ambience is a little rusty but classy. As i walked in alone, i was offered a table for two. A waiter came and took my order. I ordered farzi ok, cheese and mac pakora and milky way big bang desert. The waiter suggested me to try dal chawal arancini in place of cheese n mac pakora. He said..this will be good dude. I said okay..bring it on. I had to ask him for water too as it was not served. Well my meal started with Amuse Bouche which was mishti doi served on black stone platter. Then came my drink, Farzi OK..it was a refreshing cocktail with orange juice and kaffir lime leaves. It was good. I drank it all waiting for the starter to arrive as it took some like 15 minutes. Then came this dal chawal arancini. This is your regular dal chawal in the form of little balls coated with crushed papad and topped with achari papad and mint chatni. Presentation was impressive but it tasted just okay. After finishing it i waited for another 10 minutes for the desert to be served but it never came, so i asked the waiter for it. He came and brought me bill instead of dessert. I again told him in hindi bhai desert lana tha bill nahi. While all this was goin on, i was still waiting for water..irritated. well after another 10 minutes or so the dessert came. I have heard a lot of praise for this item..and really this thing deserve all the praise it is getting. It looked like milky way..with a number of small peices of desserts giving the impression of stars. Then the chef gives it finishing touch right on your table as he put a small strawberry flavoured something in the centre and pour on it some hot liquid which breaks it up (big bang) and in the end poured rabri all over it. Full marks for the presentation and also full marks for its taste. If not for this heavenly dessert i would have rated this place 2.5 . Yeah, finally i was served water, when i was about to finish off the desert. it was their service which really pissed me off..slow..lethargic..not fully attentive..not something one expects at Farzi. Well, overall experience, i am #NotSoFarzified",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Anupriya Sharma,"Rated The first impression of the place was great. The staff at the entrance was of great help in getting us a table quickly. The bartenders were really swift and skilled. The presentation of the food was brilliant and extremely innovative specially the candy floss mouth freshner paan in the end. However there were a few things which were a little disappointing - the quantity of the food is extremely less. Each dish that we ordered, came with only three pieces which is really less even if two people are ordering 1 dish. Also, there are not many options to choose from for Vegetarians, I had to settle for the Gupta Burger which was not something that I would like to ask for the next time I visit the place. The service is extremely - extremely slow specially on weekends as the place is fully packed! All in all a good experience..",Rated 3.5,1,64,??
Manik Grover,Rated The best place i have ever been to in my life ..... the ambience .... the crowd .... the way the workers treat .... its just fantastic and perfect ... the food is super tasty and brilliantly presented . One of the dishes we ordered took 15 mins extra to get prepared due to the crowd and the manager came and apologized almost 6 times for the small issue ... absolutely delighted by their service and the best part is that it is not overexpensive like the other cafes in the same category and frankly its a cafe only by its name ....cheers .. even the most deppressed person would come here once and be happy the rest of his life ...,Rated 5.0,13,80,??

Leena Sen,"Rated Nice ambiance with good food. Well, it is actually the presentation that I would give the credit to. Some dishes are average in taste but the way they present it, diversifies the focus. I found the drinks to be expensive as the quantity served is as less as compared to the price charged. The bunta was worth the price. If you don't have a budget restriction then I would suggest you should try their cocktails as they are all made with a twist.",Rated 4.0,18,13,??
Lucky Chugh,Rated Get ready to be farzified. The first place to serve molecular gastronomy in Delhi and it's a huge hit. I loved the tempura fried prawns with lemon foam. The pathar ke kebab are a must try. The desserts at farzi cafe are awesome. The dirt pile transforms into a goey fudgy chocolate cake and I will go back for this soon. The bottle a gin is a good looking cocktail. The amuse Bouche is a sweetened curd shot that acts as a palate cleanser..,Rated 4.5,4,31,??
Balaji Harish Iyer,"Rated Even with its modern wooden dcor and pseudo-club ambience, Farzi Caf unfortunately lives up to its name - the food is farzi down to its core. We ordered the Prawn Chettinad, Rogan Josh Buns, Galouti Burgers, Paneer Tikka and Bla-bla. The Bla-bla was certainly bla-bla and the spiciness expected out of Chettinad cuisine was really watered down to randomly sprinkled peppercorns. The mint chutney ""sauce"" definitely did not enhance the Paneer Tikka. The service is poor and delayed, and our desperation to leave the restaurant was only mirrored by the slow arrival of the check.",Rated 2.0,20,62,??
Reginald Jose,"Rated The place was absolutely amazing!! Not so sure about the vegetarian fare, but the non veg was lip smacking! We had ordered Duck Chilly Samosas, Tempura Fried Prawns, Rogan Gosht Bun and Chilly Tikka Masala and I think each of them was a treat in itself! The ambience was lovely, the music was good, and they even surprised me with am amazing desert (Chocolate Dirt Pile) since it was my birthday! The servers were also extremely attentive, without being intrusive. The only thing which I did not like was the drinks. Perhaps our choice was wrong, but the flavoured buntas and the green apple foamintini didn't really work out! Maybe I'll just stick to classics the next time...coz it's definitely a place worth repeat visits! Divya Kathryn Varghese",Rated 4.5,2,22,??
Sonam Munjal,Rated Farzi is more than a experience. the entry is bit off but once you enter in the ambience here is super classy. Innovation and presentation is something really appreciated.

Lokesh Meena,Rated Well if you watch SUITS ( an American legal drama television series) This place would give a feel of restaurants they show in SUITS. It has amazing interior. Music in there will make you move your body. Service is fast and great. Waiters are well dressed and professional. Everything we tried there was unique. Music is little loud but I guess that won't a problem if you are in a mood of party. They have a stage also but when we went there it's was empty. Overall if you go there you won't come disappointed.,Rated 4.0,32,16,??
Pearl Malhotra,"Rated We had a wonderful experience at Farzi cafe. Not only was the food absolutely delicious, but the presentation was what actually took the cake. We ordered the dal Chawal starters along with the Bhel Puri. The latter was delicious with just the right amount of savoury and sweetness. For the main course both their chicken tikka masala and gupta burger was good, especially the CTM. The gravy was rich and had just the right flavours. The drinks were innovative. However the dessert (Milky Way big band) and its presentation were absolutely wonderful especially in terms of the taste. The manager Dheerender truly made us feel special and a big thank you to him and Saba for the awesome customer service.",Rated 4.5,4,0,??
Anupriya Jolly Chugh,"Rated Farzi cafe has its cult following and as a first timer I was ready to be farzified. What I did not know was that farzi is more than a experience. It's a revelation on how classy, well presented and scrumptious Indian food can be. The entry is a bit off, you have to enter the DaMilano showroom to enter the cafe. However once in the interiors blow you away, a massive bar, contemporary lighting, a well lit balcony of sorts which is great for daytime sitting. The Amuse bouche here was served in mini bowls and the server told us to have it in one go. What initially tasted like jelly burst into mishti doi flavours in the mouth. In the drinks I loved the chai pani, its tea flavoured vodka infused cocktail which is a great option for tea lovers. The famous apple foamtini is a delight to watch when its made. The whiskey sour is a perfect blend of whiskey, cinnamon and tastes great if you don't like sweet cocktails. In the starters, the Mac & cheese stuffed balls are a must try if you love cheese. The Delhi Belly tikka is pork belly kebabs so delicious and flavoursome, its smeared with a tamarind chutney. I have never had anything so delectable. The Farzifried chicken was a huge hit with hubby but I found it a but dry. But then I'm not a fan of fried chicken. The main course served to us was appams, one was a water chestnut and asparagus appam, the best vegetarian dish ever, the water chestnut and asparagus add crunch and flavours to the perfectly made appam. The bheja fry appam was hot but lovely. The desserts I loved were the deconstructed milky way, they have an orange mousse like sun with chocolate, coconut, gajar halwa balls as planets. All deconstructed, topped with liquid nitrogen and rabri. Its a delight. The chocolate dirt pile is a must have for chocolate lovers, what you get is a pile of chocolate mud, literally. It has fennel, nuts, fruits and when chocolate sauce is added the dirt pile transforms it self into a lip smacking Mississippi mud pie.",Rated 5.0,73,358,??
Harman Narang,Rated The farzi caf was living a peaceful life in my wishlist since it's opening in CP. Located just below My bar Hq this place offers performance nights and celebrity guests during the late hours. Courtesy to a friend's birthday lunch I went there. The place is gorgeous and offers impeccable ambience.We were awestruck . We ordered Mac n Cheese pakoras Keema pav Chicken tikka Masala Mutton curry And mock tails (apple drink :p) The food was not upto the mark at all The portions were small and I expected a lot better. For dessert we had galaxy Big bang. Altogether the place was decent enough but I expected much better.Maybe overhyped.,Rated 3.5,22,73,??
Sumita Lahiri,"Rated I have been to the Farzi Cafe in Gurgaon many times and have given it a very high rating. I have only been to the Farzi Cafe in CP once, but I feel that this outlet simply did not live up to the standards of the Gurgaon outlet. We ordered dishes that I have previously ordered and liked at the Gurgaon outlet, so as to make a fair comparison - I think the execution was inferior to the Gurgaon outlet. The taco shell of the mutton boti tacos were a thin, crisp wafer that splintered into many pieces when bitten into, so eating it was not easy and the shell also did not add any flavor. The mutton was soft but covered in a thick, indistinct, salty gravy. The raj kachori as nice but the accompaniment of fried okra, which is what makes the flavour distinctive, was extremely stingy. The galouti was good but a little too salty and accompanied by some very poorly done potato wafers (very oily aftertaste), unlike the nice potato wedges which accompany the dish in Gurgaon. The pyaaz kachori with bacon was also too salty and quite hard. This restaurant is very heavy handed on the salt, so the food ends up with no distinct flavour. The service quality was way below the efficient standards in Gurgaon. It took forever to get attention and at one time the staff member brought across a beer that we had not ordered, but was simply unable to understand that we had not ordered it. We ordered some beers and we were informed that they may not be chilled very optimally as they had just received the stock. The first beer was quite acceptably chilled, but the next two got subsequently warmer. This spoke of poor management, since the restaurant would have had additional time to chill the bottles. The CP restaurant is a huge space with a niceambiance. This outlet seems significantlycheaper than Gurgaon. However, we did not really check the bill to see that it was correct. One the positive side, there seem to be a few additional dishes on the CP menu.",Rated 3.0,30,29,??
Prashant Singh,"Rated They just can't go wrong. That's the phrase which was running in my mind the time I was stepping out of Farzi Cafe's Connaught place branch. The ambience here is a little rustic and yet classy. They have a bar right at the center to provide a better service of beverages. For starters we had Baby Cashew idlis with kafir lime gun powder, Chilly Chicken Bao, Grainy mustard Fish Tikka, Smoked Pathar ke Kebab and Mutton Salli Boti Thepla. All the dishes were bang on in everything. Innovation is something that is really appreciated, and presentation and flavors were just divine too. There was another dish which I didnt mentioned above. That is Delhi Belly Tikka. It is the best pork dish I have ever had. It sumptuously soft and sinfully tasty. A must must have if you are in Farzi Cafe. For the mains we ordered for only one dish i.e. noodle biryani. It is also something I didn't expect to be this good. I will definitely come here soon for Delhi Belly Tikka and Noodle Biryani. In desserts, we had Choco Mud Pile and Milky way. They were were good. Milky way was superb in presentation and Choco Mud Pile was excellent in both. Choco Mud Pile is crumbled Chocolate sponge served with a hot chocolate Truffle Sauce on the side. So you have to pour the sauce in Pile of chocolate sponge and relish your dessert according to your sweet tooth desire.",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Natasha Ahuja,"Rated Think a superb dining experience amidst Connaught Place, Farzi Cafe. The place has contemporary decor and best part is the menu. The menu is an interesting read,they have a bit of everything. Think street food and then think about coastal food. Was served Mishti Doi as Amuse Bouche , exploding in mouth was quite innovative. Bang Bang is a must try at this place had orange,kaffir lime as main ingredients. Pork Belly and Patthar Ke Kebabs were just the perfect starters. Malabari Prawns are highly recommended too. Prawns were super fresh and yummy. In desserts Chocolate Mud Pie and Sooji CheeseCake are good. This was the first time that I had Sooji Cheesecake and I was quite impressed by it. On the whole the place is perfect for dining with friends or family.",Rated 5.0,31,226,??
Sidhant Ahuja,"Rated After having an amazing experience at the Farzi Cafe Gurgaon,I planned to visit this outlet. Farzi Cafe in Connaught Place is located in the E block. The entry to this one is from the Da Milano showroom from there one can either take the lift or the stairs. The decor of the cafe is very innovative and they have a massive central bar which certainly lives upto it's name. They have a podium for live band performances. Farzi is one the first places to bring molecular gastronomy and remains the best. Be it the amazing cocktails or the delicious desserts. We started off our meal with the Amuse Bouche which were yougurt shots and were perfect palate cleansers and had a burst of flavors in mouth. Drinks Apple Foamintini :- This was a typical molecular drink.!This was served in a funnel inside the round glass to contain the funnel. The drink had foam,Apple flavor and crushed Ice. A perfect thirst quencher. Chuski Margarita :- Chuski Margarita is what you call a desi version of margarita with a chuski in it. Served perfectly with salt on the rim of the glass is a must try. Food Talk Chilly Duck Samosa with Plum Chutney :- This was simply perfect. The outer covering of the samosa was mixed with chili garlic sauce among with other sauces. They were fried to perfection. Tempura Fried Prawn :-Fried prawns sauted in chili sauce with foam on it. Simply amazing. Very juicy and soft prawns. Every bite was divine. Mac and Cheese Pakodas:- These were Japanese style pakodas filled with Mac and Cheese. The presentation of this dish was superb. Farzi Fried Chicken :- Farzi Fried Chicken was the best dish on the item. Best thing about fried chicken is that everyone just loves it. These were served in a mini truck. Crispy juicy chicken was just amazing in taste. On the whole dining at this place was an amazing experience and the best part of the food was desserts. Milky Way galaxy which was again an amazing fusion is highly recommended too while for chocolate lovers Chocolate Mud Pie is a must try.",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Manshi Singh,"Rated On 10th February 2016, my mother, sister and I decided to have a 'Girls Day Out' and try the newly open and highly acclaimed Farzi Cafe in C.P. We had made a reservation through EazyDiner for 2:30 pm and showed up on time for the same. However, despite the reservation we had to wait for 10 minutes at the bar for our table...not a big problem...the ambience was pleasant, the place buzzing and the staff, polite. We had ordered for Galouti Burgers, Mutton Salli Boti in Thepla Wraps and Keema Kulcha in the starters and Chicken Tikka Masala for the main course on the suggestion of our server. In dessert, Parle-G Cheesecake was ordered on my sister's insistence (I wanted to try the Milky Way!). The food was delicious (or so we had thought)! My sister and I loved the oh so soft Galouti burgers and my mother, the Mutton Salli Boti wrap and Chicken Tikka Masala. The Keema kulcha can be a miss, though. Since, we had booked through Eazydiner, we had a choice to order a complimentary cocktail/mocktail per person. We ordered for a Long Island Iced Tea, Blue Blazer and Farzi Ok (mocktail). Our server announced the names of the drinks while serving us. But the so-called 'Blue Blazer' was not 'blue' at all! Thinking that perhaps 'this-is-how-it-is-done-here', we did not ask for any explanation or replacement. In the end, when our server looked disappointed as 'Blue Blazer' was hardly touched, I, unable to keep down my curiosity, asked him as to why the Blue Blazer was not in fact 'blue'? He replied that since the bartender who makes it was not there, that's why they had sent us another cocktail instead! Okkaayy! But shouldn't the restaurant inform the customer that the drink which they had ordered is not available so that they can order a replacement of their OWN choice?! Despite this minor hiccup, our food experience was great and we promised to come again and sample the rest of the menu! If the food was great and you had a good time, then why the low rating, you ask? Well, that's because of the food-poisoning and stomach upset the three of us had to endure for nearly two days after our lunch at Farzi!! We did not expect this from such an established brand and are very disappointed! We have never experienced food-poisoning of such intensity! Needless to say, the food-poisoning has marred our experience completely and the future plans made to visit Farzi Cafe in happy anticipation have come to a stand-still!",Rated 2.0,1,43,??
Meenakshi Srivastav,"Rated It feels really good to see that some of the restaurants/cafes/lounges are really working hard towards taking client satisfaction levels and food quotient of Delhi to new heights. Good food, prompt service amidst nice music is all you want when you dine out and Farzi Caf is meeting all these parameters. After reading good reviews about this Caf, I decided to give it a try and it proved apt for its fame. This place is pretty elegant with eye catching interiors. Their bar has a good collection of all sorts of drinks. We had Molecular Martini, yummy & juicy Farzi Fried Chicken and toothsome Bacon Kachori there.

I think the cafe has hardly anything which is common with other cafes. This is unique. MUST MUST try chocolate dirt pile if you have a sweet tooth. Also the staff is very polite and the manager named ""Mr. Dheerender"" sat with us as we wanted to know about the cafe's idea. He is a polite guy and suggested us to have 'Milky way' next time we visit the place. They give the bills with a typewriter.

Piyush Verma,"Rated One word for the place - remarkable. Be it their gastronomical starters & desserts or their coordinated service pattern, this outlet stands high for a lovely customer experience. It was located in inner circle, Cp and you just have to deboard the train from gate no. 6 and you would see black and white billboard over the 2nd floor. As you enter the outlet, roof lamps covered up with bamboo buckets will make it intense with dim lighting and to your first left, a big rectangular bar will welcome you. Couch seating was meant for those with large groups and hookah lovers. There's a stage at the other end for live BAND performances. It had a cover of 100 people at once and you may want to reserve a table rather wait in a sheer disappointment. I really liked the coordination between waiters and kitchen staff as they all were having ear mics with walkies to convey messages in an efficient way. You would enjoy mishti dahi welcome shots when they will burst out in your mouth once you take them. For drinks, we had Farzi Ok, Santa-Bunta, Strawberry Lemonade and Italian smooch. First 2 were similar with orange juice, kaffir lime as the common ingredient. I would recommend strawberry lemonade as it was so soothening that even it sounds as a summer drink, you must not miss a chance to have it even in cold winters. And as we move forward towards their food, we were delighted with presentation of all the dishes. Dal chawal Arenchini - Traditional Indian cuisine served with a twist. Dal and chawal mixed well, shaped into spherical balls, topped up with a round papad, achaar and mint chutney. Keema kulcha - Keema filled up in Kulchas and served with mint chutney will bring up a satisfying smile on your face. Prawn tempura - It was the dish of the day. Prawns layered up and fried and mixed with peri peri sauce and served on a plate resembling a charcoal grill. Chicken tikka masala - A rich orange colored gravy alongwith boneless chicken pieces with cheese naan was the best you could ask for. And finally desserts were to die for. Dirt pie - An artistic touch to the dessert I must say. Dry chocolate chunks served in a round wooden bowl with a sickle and additional chocolate syrup to make your own dessert pie. Milky way - That was something I would simply never forget. A big rectangular plate over which different flavoured icecream was placed representing as planets and for a fusion to make them even more cold and solid, edible chemicals involving nitrogen and dry ice were poured in over by the chef and then you could grab a bite of milky way. Not to forget MILKY was also represented through rabri between the planets and gems at some random places to depict them as asteroids. Overall it was a memorable experience and I would love to recommend this place .",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Rahul Prabhakar,"Rated Imagine a new fine-dining property that claims to bring the Indian cuisine back in vogue. With a name like Farzi Cafe, the restaurant seems ready to throw caution to the wind. Not knowing what to expect though, I decided to check out the newly opened modern Indian bistro in Connaught Place, New Delhi, last week. As a food blogger, I needed to figure out what the buzz was all about! The first thing you'll notice about the place is its eclectic decor. Stunning to say the least, this restaurant has been designed keeping in mind the gourmet diners as well as the young, sassy crowd of Delhi. Green moss adorns the walls beautifully, rendering an earthy feel. I also liked the massive Edwardian furniture and windows that makes the debutante a league apart from the rest. To accentuate the feel-good factor, they've constructed a bar right in the middle of the restaurant, complimenting with basket-style lighting neon bulbs. As soon as you enter the premises, there is an element of high energy that surrounds you. The place is well lit and airy, making it perfect for get together or parties. You can even think of hosting small scale events here since the 4700 square feet restaurant can easily accommodate close to 130 people at any given time. (FYI, the most famous Indian rapper/singer of our times, Raftaar, performed at the Farzi Cafe CP on January 30 this year). When all is said and done, I believe Farzi truly endeavors to be different in terms of aesthetics. None of this would've made sense anyway if their food or service was not up to the mark! Minutes later, I was introduced to Chef Gaurav Chawla, who has been associated with the brand since July last year. Gaurav has worked for reputed hotels such as the Dusit Devarana and Hilton, and knows the Tapas style menu like the back of his hand. To showcase a unique, modernist approach to Indian cuisine, Chef Gaurav took us through a culinary journey starting from a wide array of cocktails and appetizers to match with to a delectable main course with desserts that surprised the palate like never before. Mocktails Farzi OK - A concoction of fresh oranges, kaffir lime, and lemon juice, this juicy mocktail was served in a Jar shaped glass with handle (resembling the classic American Mason jar). Litchi Panna Desire - A signature mocktail at Farzi, this one is made of raw mango pulp, kaffir lime, lemon, and litchi juice. Strawberry Lemonade - Made of fresh strawberries and lemon chunks, this lemonade scores high on the presentation; a drink you'd want to relish all seasons. Cocktails Santa Banta - Basically a screwdriver (cocktail made out of vodka and orange juice) with kaffir lime and vanilla essence packed into a legendary Banta bottle. Farzi Apple Foamintini - Containing fresh green apple extracts, elderflower syrup, and mint foam, this appletini scores on theatrics courtesy liquid nitrogen. Welcome Shot Misti Dahi - See Molecular Gastronomy in full view, as this welcome shot made from Sodium Alginate and Calcium Salt tingles before bursting in your mouth. Appetizers Dal Chawal Arancini - Arancini is Italian for deep-fried stuffed rice balls. Replace the mozzarella and ragu with Arhar Dal Chawal and top it with achaar, papad, and green mint chutney - and voila, a near perfect appetizer is ready to be savored. Chili Duck Samosa - The whole idea of creating an illusion with cuisine comes to light with this unique chilli dumpling. I was gobsmacked to learn that the samosa had minced duck instead of the usual potato filling. And boy, it tastes really good with plum chutney. Mac and Cheese Pakora Bites - The thing about these pakoras is that they taste absolutely best when served hot and deep fried. You'll gorge on these macaroni and cheese balls that use Panko, a Japanese style breadcrumb for outer coating. Mini Raj Kachori - It is hard to imagine a chaat made of okra salad but the Mini Raj Kachori manages to create an exotic flavor that tastes magical when combined with meethi chutney disguised as foam. Tempura Fried Prawns - What happens when deep-fried prawns are layered with a spicy tangy sauce and served with Nimbu Mirchi Foam? Nothing short of pure magic! Delhi Belly Tikka - Talk of experimentation and this is the dish worth dying for. Served on a mini open grill, these barbequed pork tikkas are glazed with Murraba chutney and topped with roasted russet apple, lending the perfect flavor for your taste buds. [PS] I also loved the Beef Patthar Ke Kebab and Keema Kulcha, which were served as part of the offering. Just before the mains, I was made to taste the Khandvi Spheres which combines the goodness of jaggery with curry leaves, serving the useful purpose of cleansing the palate. Mains - Hoppers Craving for some street food from coastal India? Farzi Cafe offers the best fusion food from every nook and cranny of South India, categorizing them under 'Hoppers' - be it the Asparagus and Water Chestnut Korma, Malaya Prawns with Sri Lankan Hoppers, Prawn Chettinad, or Mutton Irachi with Malabari Paratha. Pic - Asparagus and Water Chestnut Korma with fresh coconut appam served with spicy green chili and tomato chutney Chicken Tikka Masala - For a change, the Chicken Tikka Masala was served with Cheese, not Butter Naan. Desserts The folks at Farzi truly saved the best for last. Milky Way Big Bang - Leveraging on the prowess of liquid nitrogen plus nine assorted chocolates, caramel fudge, nuts, and sauces, this unique dessert succeeds in transporting you to the make-believe world of a galaxy containing the solar system followed by the cosmic explosion that is hypothesized to have marked the origin of the universe. The preparation is done right in front of your eyes by freezing flavored milk and breaking the same into pieces. Pour milk custard all over and then wait for the magic unfold. The other fun options are Rasmalai with Carrot Flower (a gluten-free dessert), Farzi Pan Bhujiya (cotton candy version of a traditional paan), White Chocolate Rabri, Chocolate Dirt Pile, and Fudge Brownie. So there, how do I best describe my Farzi Cafe experience? It is truly an amalgamation of traditional Indian and global classics with table theatrics. The Indian influences are apparent yet there is something unique about the contemporary presentations and culinary styles. Farzi Caf takes molecular gastronomy at its peak, creating an experience which is second to none. 2brahulprabhakar.blogspot.com",Rated 5.0,30,408,??

Sagar Khurana,Rated Went to this cafe for two days in a row. One on a sunday and one the very next day. Was a bit surprised to see it packed more than it culd accomodate on a sunday. Managed to get a table quickly by calling up a friend who co-owns the place. The drinks were good especially the cola bunta. Ordered about 4-5 starters and they were great too. Espicially the galouti buns and chicken quesadilla. The service was not too on the mark and they need to better in that area. Not saying the staff wasnt helpful . They did what they could but the crowd was way too much to handle. Same thing happened the next day. This time service was poor i must say. Was waiting at the bar while my table was being arranged. Had a couple of cocktails which werent that great. Then managed to get a table as it was 11 of us. But the servers were not attentive at all and i supposed they were understaffed that night. The food was again really good as expected. I would surely visit again. Hoping for a better service this time though. But sincerely wish you the best ! Great going !,Rated 4.5,1,36,??

Prayag Mukhi,"Rated Definitely one of the most beautiful places is the Connaught place. From the ambience to the food everything is top notch. This place is just as good as their wonderful pictures present them. They will make you fall in love with their groovy music. Farzi has definitely been able to distunguish itself from other ordinary outlets in cp in the same price range. If you are into mocktails then you are definitely at the right place. Also, some of their drinks including santa-bunta,bang bang and Apple Foamintin are some of my favourites and are a must try. Banta cocktails are Another eye catching Gem! Now getting to my favourite part, Food is the best part of Farzi. Some of the most memorable dishes were: Bacon kachori, the word delicious is not enough to describe this. Mutton boti thepla wraps were like tacos with a twist. Duck samsosa, their flavour were close to total perfection. Amuse Bouche: a perfect appetiser. Braised lambchops, no way to discribe this. simply yum. Deserts are the only way end a meal which is ""that"" good. The chocolate dirt takes one of the most innovative way to present a desert. You can design this one yourself just like an architect and the taste will most certainly not disappoint you. Another wonderful desert was the milk way big bang which they make infront of you infront in a very unique way.,let's just say that this desert is a piece of art. Overall this place is not just another outlet in cp and I can sat this without doubt that it is better than most.",Rated 4.5,49,1636,??
Vikrant Singh,"Rated Sudden plan. New cafe in town. Thought of giving it a shot since I had heard a lot about the cyber hub branch and also the 4.4 rating on here ! First things first , the seating is the most messed up I have ever seen. They close out the main section during weekdays. Tables are like rocking chair. Almost felt like leaving ( hope I did) but stayed on. DRINKS : Why do u have like 10-12 brands of beer on your menu , when you only have like only 4-5 available. It's pretty annoying. But the beer is decently priced. Should start with draught ones as well. Margarita was, and I quote my friend , "" The worst I ever had"" FOOD : Just ordered two items out of the menu ( should have stopped at the first one itself). Their quantity , every bloody thing has just three pieces. For gods sake at least give four, so that if two people have come they won't have a problem sharing . Trust me the quantity is the worst I have seen. There was one chicken changezi quesadilla. One word - Tasteless. And the other was some mutton taco or something. It had so much oil dripping that if USA came to know about it, they would attack Farzi !! The saving grace was the Sheesha and some pretty nice mouth freshener they give at the end. Service was decent ! All in all a bitter experience ! Maybe you should give this place a try once. I did and I ain't going back",Rated 2.5,3,42,??
Jayant Dalmia,"Rated Moderately impressive. So, I call up this place one fine afternoon and request for a reservation in the evening and I'm told that they don't take reservations. Once I reached the restaurant, I find two tables with 'Reserved' tags on them. On enquiry, I was told that reservations were possible through some partner website. Could I have been informed about such an arrangement when I had called earlier? Definitely. Was I? Nope. Why? Well, this is Delhi and that's how things work. I had the misfortune of sitting on the table near the entrance (on both my visits) which has high sofas on one side and backless bar stools on the other. The furniture seems fancy but scores really low on comfort. It felt like a punishment to sit on those wobbly bar stools for long. Even the table was somehow made stable by shoving some tissues under one of its legs to stop it from wobbling. Also, the tables are really small. Given how elaborate their serving-ware is, you are always jostling for space to fit things somehow. As far as food is concerned - Is it tasty? Yes. Is it innovative? Meh. I had mac-n-cheese poppers which no doubt were delicious but - cheesy pasta dipped in batter and breadcrumbs and deep fried - yep, I've had that before, a number of times. The farzi vada-pav was a low point - it was dry and even tasted a bit weird. I guess this is being lapped up by those who've never had a half-decent vada paav. There was a paneer tikka dish was again ordinary (gravy was too sweet) and a matar-paneer-served-in-an-appam which was highly average. The idea of paying 500 bucks (plus taxes) for one appam and 3 spoonfuls of matar-paneer now seems absolutely ludicrous. The only two things which I'd recommend is the tandoori guchhirisotto and the khowsuey. Of course, you can get far better risottos at nice Italian places but it's decent here too. Also, I'm not too sure about the authenticity of KhowSuew because I'm yet to visit a proper Burmese place to sample some of it. I had 'chocolate dirt pile' for dessert which was looked interesting in the beginning - chocolate powder stuff with lots of nuts and a few pieces of fruit with hot chocolate sauce thrown on top. Tastes really good. When you reflect on it, you'll notice that it is a nutty brownie with chocolate sauce presented in an alternate manner. The servers are friendly but only as friendly as they are in any typical Delhi nightclub/lounge. The pricing is on the higher side and some expensive items are real let-downs. Get your expectations right -Wanna cool place to grab drinks with friends and munch of some decent food? This place is a good option.Looking for some thought-provoking culinary creations using modern techniques? Give it a pass",Rated 3.5,205,690,??
Prerna Jain,"Rated I had great expectations from this cafe but sadly it didnot live up to my expectations. The ambience is no doubt quite quirky. But what's in the ambience if the food is not upto the mark. The waiter suggested us a few dishes and we ordered it accordingly and guess what we all were exactly sailing in the same boat. The food was just very normal,nothing extra ordinary about it for that matter. You can surely have better soya chaaps on the streets rather than shelling out your money here. Moreover the quantity of food was so less. We ordered this margharita kulcha and the plate had just three tiny kulchas. Hence, apart from the ambience there is nothing so impressive about the farzi cafe. They must surely ponder over such issues.",Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Viraj Singh,Rated What an amazing place! Went there for lunch. The place is brilliantly made. You will have to enter the cafe through the Da Milano store which is kind of weird.

The managers were helpful enough to make sure that we were satisfied with the table and everything else. Coming to the food. The food at this place is delicious and is served very beautifully. They give you a really tasty palate cleanser between courses. The portions are good. Did not really enjoy my drink even though i was told that this particular drink was their speciality.

Luckily, they can be found easily amidst the hustle at CP above Da Milano outlet. (I'm sure this has definitely increased the number of women customers at Milano :P) The moment you enter this place, it's elegant decor with the classy black 'n' gold combination welcomes you with great vibes and a very welcoming staff. Food: Farzi is known for its delicious food and picturesque presentation and it hasn't failed to deliver from what I've heard and experienced. We were here for a quick lunch so didn't get to order much this time. We decided to try Keema Kulcha with jalepeno raita (starter) and Pao Bhaaji (Mains). Pao Bhaaji came looking amazing in cute truck and a bowl. Just one statement - kick-ass presentation and absolutely delicious! The only thing - bhaaji was a little cold. Service: Initially it took us a while to get hold of the staff to place our order but it was good after that. So no complaints on that. Price: Definitely value for money! I would recommend it to everyone for sure and going to visit it again myself to try other mouth-watering dishes.

Wait time was 1 hour - went around CP and came back 5 mins before the hour to realize that the waiting was likely to be much longer. Special thanks to Iram (I believe that is what her name was) who managed to put 3 seats together for us slightly out of our turn (maybe because she realized my kid sister would not fit into the bar area where most of the waiting crowd was moving)! Started ordering the food and drinks thereafter - was served by Harpreet who was polite and helpful when one could locate him (no complaints, there were a lot of people!). 0.5 star less because their mocktails are not anything to write home about. But the food is out of the world! Had the goat cheese veg starter and chicken starter without cheese/curd dressing (there were three options in all). Moving on to the main course, had a dosai dish - was very tasty (thumbs up only if you like spicy food!) and the khao suey (different from the traditional; rice and curry served separately!) - both very well prepared and served within 5-10 mins of order! TO top it off, had the Milky Way Big Bang dessert - which has a nice charade around the preparation (simple, childish but yet innovative!). Dessert portion is huge and somehow managed to finish. Bill slightly higher than the Zomato rating; but ate well and serving sizes of each dish can feed 2; if ordered carefully the $$ can be optimized! Overall great experience.

Vaidehi Misra,"Rated Go there during the late evening, enjoy the remnants of the sun set and waltz away with their cocktails and Sufi music into the night. You are paying for the food, the drinks and the shisha but you also pay for the grunge yet Sufi yet Delhi ambience. The food, the starters especially have big, bold, overlapping flavours. The duck samosas are heavily coated, the pork has a Mohammad Ali tangy punch, the lamb ribs my friends thoroughly enjoyed and even proclaimed were the best the palace had to offer, the keema paratha and chorizo chicken quesadilla were the quintessential, heavy on masala appetisers that go well with drinks and enjoyed by India meat lovers. The surprise were the mushrooms- they were almost smoky with the Italian kind of heavy sauce, cheesy yet so flavourful. We were a group of 7 and there were differing opinions on everything. My suggestion, know (if not, atleast have an idea of) what you like, read the menu and let Farzi give you an innovated, Punjabi punch to it. If you don't like basic pork then trying the dish with a twist, might not be the smartest move. There was consensus on the deserts. The dirt pile, Baklava and Parle G Cheese Cake depending on if you like dry fruits, chocolate and not-chocolate are the your best bets. If you like the extravagant show, then the Milky Way is kind of their showstopper. It has drama, liquid nitrogen and the chef comes and performs it front of you, but your taste buds don't dance away. The money is best spent at Farzi, when you have time on your hands and an attitude welcoming the slightly uncertain. Don't get deceived by the Da Milano entrance, you are heading the right way.",Rated 4.0,22,98,??

Rumika Kurar,"Rated I have not been to Farzi in Gurgaon, so the review is based solely on my experience at the CP outlet. First of all, we were two of us, however, the waiter some how in his head, did some formulaic calculation and handed the drinks menu just to my friend and the food menu just to me. So that gives you a clue about the service at the outset, anyway I finally did receive the drinks menu and all the above mentioned effort felt futile since the cocktails had NO description whatsoever. Which is fine if you want to order a ""Whiskey Sour', however, if you are intrigued by a drink named ""Santa Banta"", you would want to know what it entails..am I supposed to laugh at it and think I have consumed it..like what??!! And this similar trend was observed on the food menu as well, which was a whirlwind vortex of fusion cuisine/names without adequate or any description. Ordered the Chilli Duck Samosas and Boti Salli Thepla and both were decent, duck was a bit overpowered by the chilli but braised well and the theplas were good enough with the mutton prepared decently. The dessert (much hyped and famous)-Parle G Cheesecake was a very big disappointment..no creativity, innnovation..the decription said accompanied with ""custard"" which actually was rabri. The cheesecake was topped with chocolate ""gems"", none of the accompaniments could make you forget the insipid, lacklustre, synthetic taste of the cheesecake. The chef could have atleast made a crumbled crust out of the biscuits instead of using them as two layers to fill the cheesecake with!! We couldn`t taste more than two spoonfuls. We were given complimentary paan that came encased in gujia shaped cotton candy which actually was quite pleasant after the dessert fiasco and reflected some originality. We paid the bill and were returned Rs.4 less, which is a petty amount not to be mentioned here, however, we were still short of what was written on the bill and I am willing to bet the entire bill amount that none of the serving staff had any clue about the same, since we never were given the formal customary ""no change"" response.

Shweta Chandan,"Rated I've been to Farzi in Gurgaon quite a few times and have been recommending it to lots of people. But my experience at the CP outlet was pretty disappointing. It was my birthday (though no one knew), and I decided to take my parents there since I had been raving about it. At Farzi, the experience and the little tid bits (like the mishti doi etc.) are part of it. I called a few hours in advance through the no. at Zomato and a gentleman confirmed my reservation and took down my number. However, when we reached, the woman at the entrance had no record of it on her list. There were a few tables available, so thankfully we got to sit. We ordered the starters, though I felt there was a strange stale smell to the vada pay. I didn't say anything and we ordered the main dishes. Suddenly I realised that we never got the mishti doi and it was almost time for our food to arrive and we hadn't got the palette cleanser either! I called on the guy serving us, he said the mishti doi was over so he didn't get it but now he will, along with the palette cleanser. Our food arrived and still no sign of either. Finally we had all 3 things together on the table so we just them gulped down so the food wouldn't get cold. The food in itself was very good. We ordered the chorizo pulao, the guchhi risotto and chicken masala. I did call the manager and inform him that I had brought my parents here Coz I love Farzi, but the experience has been lacking. He was polite and apologised. Finally, we ordered dessert and the waiter while keeping it on the table informed me that it's on the house. It was a statement, devoid of any apology or emotion, as if giving me a free dessert makes it all okay. Also, there were 2 guys alternately serving us and one in of them could barely speak clearly or understand. He had no knowledge of the menu and could not answer my queries or recommend a dessert when I asked. The bathrooms were also disappointing. The basin area was all wet and the dustbin was overflowing with tissues falling to the ground. I will give this outlet another chance Coz I love the food. But I would rather go all the way to Gurgaon if there is no improvement here. I hope Mr. Kalra can look into this!",Rated 3.0,10,90,??

Keema Kulcha: kulcha with filling of keema amazing. Soya Chanp: wonderful flacour with wonderful taste. Pathar ke Kebab: Beef Kebabs infused with Walnut and Wasabi. Soft, juicy and tasty. Delicious beef ever had. Prawn Tempura: Cooked to perfection prawns topped with a creamy sauce. MINT RAJ KACHORI WITH CRISP OKRA AND MINT FOAM: Thick Curd, Wow mint, and tamarind chutney and some stuffing into the kachori were wonderful! PORK BELLY TIKKA: One of the most underused meats in the northern part of the country. KHANDAVI: A palate cleanser, It definitely helps savour the main course better and enjoy the whole meal. Now time for desserts: Dirt Pie: Would love to eat this dirt everyday. Chocolate with nuts, fresh fruits and nuts. A must must try. Milky Way: The dessert exactly describes The Milkyway Galaxy. This is a master piece. So an amazing journey came to an end. I won't say a lot u need to visit this place. My overall experiance was amazing. Love to visit again.",Rated 5.0,9,55,??

Akshi Sharma,Rated First of all this was my very first experience at Farzi Cafe and since my first step in I was just awestruck by the whole experience. The ambiance is just lavishly beautiful and the staff was warm and friendly. Special mention to Saba who took every order with a smile. The food as you can see in the pictures was innovative and delicious. I went with two friends who are equally in love with this place. For drinks we ordered a Santa Banta pitcher which was perfect to go with the food that we had. Overall the place is a must try with a bunch of friends as well as for a nice family time. Double thumbs up to the staff of Farzi Cafe for being a real deal and not just farzi!!,Rated 4.5,17,40,??
Sinchita Kar,"Rated ""The longer you wait for something, the more you appreciate it when you get it"". This is the sentiment I'm feeling while penning this out. Since its inception in Gurgaon, this place has been on my wishlist. Unfortunately, never got the chance to review it because, seriously speaking, who would travel all the way to Gurgaon from Noida? But when the buzz of Farzi Cafe opening in the heart of Delhi started flowing, I got super excited! Thankfully, I got an invite and was super delighted by the experience. I got awestruck from the moment I entered the premises. The lobby is chic and fascinating. As we go upstairs byelevator, I get the chance to meet a very polite manager who helps me find my blogger friends. The DECOR is definitely modern and chic. The Cafe aimed at catering all sorts of people: the fine dining people where a small area is reserved for them, the hookah lovers get the chance to sit on the couches and relax, the music lover thanksthe presence of a live band, and finally the liquor lovers thanks to a U-shaped bar table with many high-chairs present. The AMBIENCE catches your attention and drags you further inside to savour the stellar dishes. Keep it mind, this place becomes a pub at night time. It's truly a chameleon! For DRINKS I just loved: 1) BANG BANG: Its a gang bang of few large portions of liquor mixture served in a barrel topped with Orange slice is all you need to get tipsy! 2) FARZI APPLE FOMINTING: thanks to the server who helped me choosing this drink and it was one of the best cocktails I ever tasted. Foamy, but the green apple rocking my taste buds. For FOOD, we tried few dishes but I intend to write the ones that caught my attention: 1) AMUSE BOUCHE: It was a perfect start to the wonderful lunch with the right amount of fruitiness and foam. 2) VADA PAV: Reverse version because the ""pav"" is inside and spiced mashed potatoes are outside; This street food was remarkably made and well presented with Garlic Mint Chutney made us love it more. 3) MINT RAJ KACHORI WITH CRISP OKRA AND MINT FOAM: Thick Curd, Wow mint, and tamarind chutney and some stuffing into the kachori were wonderful! 4) FRIED PRAWN TEMPURA: Fried accompanied by tamarind foam. It was flavorful just right never overwhelming my senses. Perfect is the word! 5) BACON KACHORI: ""heaven on the plate"" would be an understatement. Definitely, a must try!! 6) SYRIAN BEEF SLIDERS: delicious, tender and worth trying for beef lovers! 7) PORK BELLY TIKKA: One of the most underused meats in the northern part of the country, this sweet spicy wonder is something to try out multiple times. Accompanied by roasted russet apples and Murraba Glaze. Although being in a tandoor means that the meat is a teeny weeny bit overdone, but the flavours that engulf it more than compensate for it. Im not a pork lover, but I was wooed by it! Khandvi, a palate cleanser, came in between which was again a unique creation. It definitely helps savour the main course better and enjoy the whole meal. After being so stuffed, we desperately wanted to try their DESSERTS! 1) THE MILKY WAY BIG BANG: If you like art, this dish is for you. The whole presentation of this dish is absolutely fabulous. The chef himself comes to describe the dish and it is so much of fun seeing the theatrics on the plate. A special mention to the coconut balls and the spice chocolate balls, I absolutely loved them. Do not miss this!! 2) THE CHOCOLATE DIRT: This dish is highly recommended for all the chocolate lovers. The gooey hot Chocolate on Chocolate mud with Chocolate crunch with Chocolate spiced balls with Chocolate brownie and fresh fruits, thinking too much chocolate?!! NOOO, the chef has done a fab job in balancing chocolate in this dish, despite having soo many chocolate elements, this dish doesn't feel too chocolaty. The fruits give soo much of freshness to the dense flavors of chocolate. Thanks to the Head Chef Mr. Saurabh Udinia for such a wonderful experience. I'm really glad they lived hugely upon my expectations of Farzi Cafe! I guess the quote was apt! A suggestion? You can obviously read my review but it might not give you a real experience.

Sahil Sareen,"Rated They say that the outlet in CP is not as good as the one in gurgaon, but whether it was the happiness of the occasion or the company, this place struck a cord even in the first visit. Their concept of visual gastronomy if i may call it, is appealing and refreshing. However, to supplement farzi's unique take on the traditional combinations of food, they can certainly add some mainstream maincourse for the ones whos palatal buds demand the same.

Ashima Saxena,"Rated Consistent ratings at 4.5/5 could only mean one thing that this place knows it's food right and a bunch of us landed here to check it out and believe me it's true. Remember that game we used to play as young kids when we would close our eyes and scroll our finger down a list and then would stop when a friend told us to, and wherever the finger rested would be the selected option. I dare you to do the same with the menu because everything that we ordered was plated beautifully and tasted exquisite. Special mention about the pathar gosht, chilly duck samosa, macroni cheese pakora. The drinks can be missed and go in larger groups so you can order a lot of variety and not burn a hole through your pocket. Also must try the chocolate mud pile for dessert!!!

Tanya Singh,"Rated Farzi Cafe came highly recommended by someone I trust food wise and it didn't disappoint. We were welcomed with complimentary amuse bouche, which were delicious and impressed with their presentation. For drinks I ordered a chuski margherita and my partner ordered the shikanjvi banta. The chuski margherita was lipsmacking and I savoured every sip but unfortunately my partner wasn't too impressed with the banta. For food we only ordered the chicken quesadillas, which were very satisfying. Their sheesha bar is highly impressive - they have two dedicated sheesha ""bartenders"".

Aarti Ahuja,"Rated Farzi mei there is little about your marzi! The theatrical aspect of dining with welcome shots and palate cleansers adds the ooh factor. The staff was very helpful and kind in sitting us ,a young bunch of pretty knowledgeable take on the menu servers. Presentation presentation presentation! !!!!!!! Take the prize for that now to the nitty grittier Fish tikka with mustard and mayo two ways 4 pieces, big enough to say that along with filling your mouth it flakes away at the fish craving. Lamb tacos, sadder part of appetiser as the lamb was cooked in masala and green chutney made it soggy saved it by the crunchy punjabi lachas as garnish. Wish they could be more refined as to taste the lamb more than the masala and keep the taco crunchy please! Main food vein made it clear to me that old time favourites excite you but then not always bright up the palate. Nehari was just tender lamb shank with a heavy fragrant gravy served with a kalongi naan. Though it could have been a little more fall of the bone and maybe 3 shanks .Very good effort as it kept the flavour profile to traditional style. Chicken tikka masala with cheese naan brilliant juicy soft chucks of chicken in the wonderful masala of old time flavours more and more reminding that masala masala is after all the most important saala of the chicken wala. The end was incomplete couldn't try the parleg cheesecake will go back for that. For the curtain call we were served cotton candy gujia pan the intricacy of it made me think Farzi was a good marzi for celebrating my dad's 61st birthday.",Rated 4.0,40,461,??
Ankit Sharma,"Rated I have visited the Dlf Farzi. No doubt the ambience and dcor is fabulous, the staff is well trained and elegant but what I didnt liked was the coolness factor I need in a caf. It is portrayed as a high class restaurant cum diner with strict schedule for ""snack"" that too in a laid-back place. I mean what's the point of naming it cafe or a joint and not chilling out? Plus, the food menu is just too stingy and worst of all, the servings were not that appropriate. I had to keep the small potato slices from falling on the table.

Kats,"Rated So finally the Molecular Masters of Gurgaon comes to CP. Never got the chance to visit Farzi gurgaon as it was way too far for me, so was very excited to visit Farzi CP. As u enter the place a huge Bar will welcome u. Sitting arrangement for different needs are done specially loved the shesha segment. Natural light coming in the shesha section makes it more beautiful. A small stage set for performances. As the place had already made an impression in Gurgaon so the level of expectation was very high and definitely Farzi CP lived up to it. So coming to the main reason Farzi is popular for ""The Food""...... After we settled down and started to explore the menu Mishti Doi shots arrived to enhance the appetite. We started to order drinks. Many were ordered like Jamun and Aam Panna Banta, Apple Foamintini, Farzi Idea, Pina Colada etc out of which Bang-Bang , Pina Colada, Monkey Sour and Snow White were the best. And the bestest was Bang-Bang which comes in a small barrel with different citrus flavour and vodka this was super star. Followed By: ( = Recommended) Dal Chawal Arenchini : Indian staple Lentil and Rice together as a ball coated with crushed Papad and topped with Achari Papad. Italian favourite with Indian tadka. Mac & Cheese Balls: Everyone love Mac & Cheese and when formed into pop able delights it becomes more awesome. Pathar ke Kebab: Beef Kebabs infused with Walnut and Wasabi. Best beef Kebabs ever had. Soft, juicy and flavourful. Prawn Tempura: A different version of the classic dish. Cooked to perfection prawns topped with a creamy sauce and Lemon forth is party of flavours. Goat Cheese Kebab: Was good. Full of flavours a vegetarian's love. Chilli Pork Ribs: Ribs were, are and may be forever Farzi's specialty. Meat falling off the bones, soft, succulent a bit spicy. In one word AWESOME. The Galauti Burger: The bun was fine but the hero was the patty. The flavoursome Galauti with perfect spice blend and melt in mouth texture will make you fall in love with it. Chicken Tikka Masala: This came in a small red phone booth. Really Fancy. Though nothing out of the world but no complains about it. Mutton Burra Tacos: Spicy Mutton Burra in hard shell Tacos. Mutton lovers delight. A bit messy but the mess is writhed. Chicken Fry: Crunchy outside soft juicy inside. With Barbeque Mayo tastes amazing. Amritsari Fish and Chips: Though what we were served was not that good but I believe it can be better. The crust had the Amritsari flavour, the fish was flakey but seasoning was missing and altogether didn't came out well. Now time for "" Farzi"" style desserts: Sooji Halwa Cake: Simply halwa but farzi style. Light on sweet but yumm. Nolen Gur Bakhlawa: As a Bakhlawa is was good. But if said Nolen Gur in it, I couldn't get the flavour of Gur. Dirt Pie: Would love to eat this dirt everyday. Chocolate with nuts, fresh fruits and nuts. And to satisfy your chocolate love chocolate syrup to top it. A must must try. Milky Way: A Molecular dessert made and presented so well that you can't decide whether to eat or not. The dessert exactly describes The Milkyway Galaxy, with orbit made of white chocolate, a scoop of ice cream frozen to create a sun, 9 different types of sweet bits to represent planets, pistachios and nuts to form asteroid belt. This is a master piece. Parle G Cheese Cake was Gurgaon's star and Milkyway is CP's star. So an amazing journey came to an end. I won't say a lot u need to visit this place to feel what I felt. Simply ""FARZIFIED"".....",Rated 5.0,91,651,??
Paresh Gupta,"Rated Waited Long to try out Farzi & Finally got the Opportunity to do so & that too in Style! Firstly if you're coming by Metro & you Exit towards E Block Gate No.3 you would be able to see this Restaurant as soon as you Exit.It's right there upfront. As soon as I entered, The interiors made me fall in Love with the Place at 1st sight. Of course the Food being even more Beautiful, Innovative & very Pleasing to the Palate. We started off with the Dahi shots which Chef Nitesh Kalra got for us - which were basically the Mishti Doi Shots & I really liked it.The Dal Chawal Arachini Balls served with Papad on Top & Chutney were Crispy & Tasty, gave a Perfect Beginning.Then came the Mac n Cheese Pakora Bites in a cute little toy Bicycle, again well done.Then my South Indian Palate came into action & I could identify 2 Superb Dishes.One in the name of Pinenuts and Scallions Paddu Yaki served with Parmesan Papad which is a Traditional South Indian Snack & the other being Water Chestnut served with Appam & 2 Chutneys - Red Tangy Tamarind & Usual Green Chutney - Another Delight to my Hunger! Then came the Goat Cheese & Walnut Tikki - though it's said that Goat Cheese has a pungent smell but no this version of their Tikki tasted Awesome & I could also taste the Crunchy Walnuts inside it.The Rajasthani Pyaaz ki Kachori - the small Baby Kachoris also tasted like the Soft home-made version which is to my Liking.Vada Pav Farzified was the only Dish here which I was disappointed with! Though I like Sweet Potatoes and they use that instead of usual Potatoes for the Filling, but sadly couldn't find any Taste in it! Avoidable in my Opinion.Then the Khandvi Palate Cleanser was also served which was basically Khandvi Lollipop & was likeable. Being a Risotto Fan I had to go for their Tandoori Guchhi Rissoto which was basically made with this Kashmiri Exotic Variety of Mushrooms named Guchhi & had a very Peppery Taste, Balanced Cheese & Rice Cooked Perfectly.Thick & Served with Parmesan Papad.A must order Dish if you Like Risotto! It was certainly one of the BEST Risottos I've ever had.",Rated 5.0,28,323,??

This outlet is smaller as compared to the other. Nonetheless, it didn't not kill any excitement to visit in cp which was nearer to me than Gurgaon. The Forte of this place is the molecular gastronomy in the drinks. I tried several cocktails and mocktail out of which wall banger, chai pani and bottle ka gin are my favourites. Now coming to food, I had the pork, tempura prawns, chicken Tikka and chicken burger. The quality of food served here is second to none. The pork was one of the best I had so far and the prasns were amazing. The burger was also delicious which served in a cool box. In vegetarian there was soya champ and paneer and both were good.

So when it finally opened its door in CP, I simply had to go n try it out!

Do remember to order additional breads with them (if in a big group) The presentations are undoubtably great, and it was packed for Sunday lunch (they don't take reservations either).

SM,"Rated Don't be fooled by this (mis)nomer of a name that they are known by. The menu will keep you guessing until the ordered dish arrives(and how!) and blows your senses..all of them(OK..not the ears..thankfully!) away. I went prepared to for some romance ""with"" food and boy was I floored BIG Thank you for your CP outlet, Cyber Hub is just too far. Ordering the food was fun in itself(they have a very well thought out menu) and the guy serving us(Shahbaaz..ty) indulged us with good suggestions and super fast service. We ordered Green curry marinated paneer tikka(which was a revelation, considering i'm not a paneer fan!). Tandoori margarita kulcha with bloody mary ketchup(essentially a pizza with mozarella inside)..the melted cheese oozing out of the kulcha is sure to melt your heart too..the only minus point is the bloody mary ketchup which is too sweet for my liking.(Note to myself: order minus ketchup next time!) Goat cheese stuffed tangri kebab was relish(yummmm)ed by the non-veg eating partners in crime. Btw, I've never seen the ""NV types"" enjoying veg with such enthusiasm until now, which is why most of the food we ordered was veg..yayyyy!! Tandoori guchchi risotto Parmesan papad was nice. Remember how the fairy godmother turned ""Pumpkins"" into a beautiful chariot"" for Snow White..well, in the modern take, its been turned to a Pumpkin & Coconut Khao Suey by Farzi. For dessert, we ordered a Choco Dirt Pile, and each bite was different from the last(u'll know what i mean when u try one). And finally complimentary candyfloss pan to sum it all up for us Indians. That's the only time I felt tricked, coz the first one had a nice pan-wali filling, and the two after that(which i greedily asked for) drew blanks. The only suggestion that I have is that the food needs to be super hot when served,which it wasn't(and we were seated right next to the pantry). So a minus .5 each for the ketchup and 2 blank complimentary pans later, I give Farzi a 5, not because I flunked math, but coz I totally loved everything else(I'm in louuu...sue me!)",Rated 5.0,5,1,??
Kaka,"Rated If books are not to be judged by their covers, then bars should not be judged by their names. You would never visit TGIT on a Thursday, but a visit to FC is never FARwait-for-itZI(You can stop reading now ;-)) Initially the whole place might look like a Jazz bar but a further peek in and you start appreciating the effort the owners have to house all kinds of people into the place. With tables, chairs and sofas of varying size to accommodate the foodies, the hookah-lovers and the bar-lovers. Completed with a mini stage that can house a band and an even better food and bar menu, FC has set a benchmark for the bars opening up every day in CP. If youre looking for in-depth quality(as in not just presentation) then FC has that, every food that we ordered off both their menu are delectable with just one or two missing the mark. Too good to be true? Go visit the place and know it for your-self because no review or photo uploaded does justice to this place (Certainly not mine). After picking up a sweet spot next to the stage (just the drum kits on it) we sat and marvelled at the beauty of the place till the point the attendant asked us about what we would order. They started us of with the appetite cleanser and the following: Dal Chawal Arachini: Presented well, a dal-rice ball that is both juicy and delicious. I know it sounds pretentious but these were decent. Mutton burra tacos: A fusion of dishes from both the spice lands (India and Mexico). Juicy and Spicy mutton burra stuffed into crispy and hot and crispy tacos make for an excellent starter. I was Farzified the minute these were in my mouth. Mac and Cheese balls: Another of their brilliant dishes, our expressions were similar to that of actors in the Dairy Milk shots ad. I mean cmon every loves mac and cheese, but mac and cheese in fried balls.. JUST TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amritsari fish and chips: Every foodie loves some fried and crispy fish, but this was a major let down. It was very crispy, hot but it tasted very bland; the Ajwain clearly overpowered any other flavour because it felt like there wasnt any, and quite frankly the only farzi dish we came across. Then came the best of them all: the chilly pork ribs. These were literally covered in a very-spicy sauce (I was too busy eating them rather than have the chef explain to me how they were made). Soon after that we had some paduyaki, a south indian snack which is quite similar to donut balls, which were average and can be avoided to say the least. As one our friend was yet to join us, we thought of taking a break because we were quite sure there would be nothing left for him to eat with the pork ribs already being in our re-order list. We shifted our gaze to the drinks menu. Bunta: Made a day before, some flavours might not be available when you visit the place. We ordered Kala Jamun and Aam papad, of which the Kala Jamun was decent and the Aam papad- disastrous to be honest. Blue Blazer: Hot Jim Beam whisky with orange juice, not a jim beam lover, but this one was good. BANG BANG: Everyone at the table loved this one, whisky and vodka lovers alike. Rum, vodka and a host of citric juices, served in a mini wooden barrel. While we couldnt place the alcohol or the juices for that matter, we just couldnt stop drinking it. After our friend joined us we moved to a more lavish seating as were all tired after eating. We had some Jaeger bombs (served in a mini double saxophone, adding to the Jazz theme in place) and hookah. After a bit more discussion about FCs interiors and some candid hookah photos we ordered for the Mutton galauti Burgers (me being a burger lover and all) and chicken tikka masala along with the reorders. The Mutton galauti burgers, served in a mini vanity bag were phenomenal even though they were quite small. The chicken tikka masala for some reason was placed in a mini red phone booth and was scrumptious, certainly not the best in Delhi, but good anyhow. Then came the desserts, we ordered Suji ka halwa, Milky-way and Dirt Pie (The latter two being Farsis USPs). Of the three, Suji ka halwa was the best while the Milky-way and Dirt Pie won bragging rights for creativity and presentation. Milky-way- Emulating the our Milky-way galaxy complete with asteroid belt and 9 planets and the sun, with molecular gastronomy being used to turn the sun(scoop of ice cream) to brick form. The presentation by the chef had us all from our seats but we were quick to move to the dirt pie as soon as we had finished tasting it. Dirt pie- Another dish which didnt live up to the way it was presented in, might be because of the fact that I am not much of a chocolate fan or because we were completely stuffed or because FC is too good when it comes to presentation. Its often that a place has been discredited on the grounds of bad service on weekends or one dish that didnt exactly sit well with the reviewer (for example the Amritsari Fish and Chips that we had), but nonetheless FC was a joyful experience for us and the food was just too good with the presentation and ambiance altogether giving it a near perfect score that it deserves.",Rated 4.5,43,154,??

Hency Batheja,"Rated ""Molecular gastronomy: Exploring the science of flavour"" The famous molecular gastronomy from Gurgaon comes to Central Delhi. With alluring interiors, aiding location and an exclusive menu, FC can win your heart and can be your favourite party place in town. We visited FC on a chilly saturday night and were welcomed by the warmth of the service there. You are welcomed by a huge BAR and a cute bartender :p when you enter the place. Great food quotes enhance the beauty of the place and increase your lust for food. Some of the extraordinary drinks and dishes that beautified our palate were: Chai-pani: A perfect blend of apple, gin with the right balance cinnamon was the highlight of the day. It was poured from a small kettle. Bang bang: A mix of different liquors served in an old-fashioned barrel topped up with a slice of orange. It was perfect tipsy-fying drink of the day. Three musketers: The name takes you back to your childhood days and so will the ingredients. It takes just chocolate, smoked orange and a dash of chillis to make this spicy drink. Other drinks we had: Bubbling jaljeera, Litchi Panna Desire and Apple Foamitini, each one stood out from the other. Before our food, we were served little Salted Caramel Shot pallete clensers. The starters were enough to amaze us everytime we ordered something. Few of them are: Raj kachodi with crispy okra and mint foam: Reinventing the famous north indian street food, which is totally delicious. Served with some okras whose crush enhanced the flavours of the dish. Baby cashew idlis: Idlis are my all-time favourite and when they are fried with some cashews, the favouritism for this south indian delicacy increases. Vada paos: With the paos hidden inside the vadas, the whole concept of a vada pao changes. This dish made me want more of the mumbaikar's delight. Mac N Cheese Pakoras: The combination of mac n cheese can never go wrong and worked well with the pakoras as well. Dal Chawal Aranchini: This dish is one of my favourites from the FC Gurgaon menu too. Our daily staples topped up with baby papads and minty chutney have always been a complete delight. I cannot end my day without something to fulfill my sweet cravings. FC stood up to my expectations of good food with great desserts. My sweet craving were fulfilled by some milestone dishes like: Bailey's pop: Frozen baileys on a stick is how i would desribe this. I couldn't help but ask more of this! Milky Way: Made to resemble our milky way constellation with little chocolate, ice cream and fudge planets. This is something you can totally call 'a heavenly delight'. Choco dirt pie: You wouldn't mind eating this dirt. You cannot miss this great dining experience where everything just amazes you and you fall short of stars to give to every dish (somebody needs to have a higher rating than 5) #GettingFarzified!!",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Nikita Jain,"Rated I wish i could stand on the entrance of this spot to tell people this place is the most annoying place in connaught place . Not even a single person ( waiter or manager) is bothered to attend the guest over there and on the top of it they think we all are thiefs as if we will steal the food and make an exist . On the bar side they ask you to give your card before placing an order. This is highly unrespectable thing i have ever seen in any foodhouse. BRAVO!! On the top of it, even after waiting for 1 hour there are no seating arrangements done for the people. Please dont vist this place speacially on saturday night.

CA Gaurav Agarwal,Rated The farzi in gurgaon is a great place to enjoy. However was a little disappointed post visit to the place in Connaught place.

Deep,"Rated ""Epic in every aspect of gastronomy"" were the words in my mind when I left farzi cafe after having a close to perfect lunch. Molecular gastronomy is trending these days and this place excels at it, its like dining at indian accent but at an affordable price. The ambience was amazing,the decor is nice and the music goes well with food. The service is very prompt and all the staff is very helpful (though the service was slow at times, i won't blame as this place was full house). For cocktails I had Bang Bang,a vodka based which came in a barrel, very refreshing and the fresh juices made it even better. Snow white and the seven dwarfs was another great cocktail with ginger froth wheras Farzi idea was nothing special but i liked the bulb-like glass it came in. When coming to food, this place deserves full points. Pathar ke kebab- most tender beef kebabs I have ever tasted which were infused with walnuts and wasabi. Prawn tempura - well marinated prawns topped with lemon froth. I was expecting something crispy, but this variation was quite good. Goat cheese kebabs- very delicious. Must say that this place is heaven for vegetarians. Perfectly crafted and beautifully served. Chilli pork ribs - succulent and tasty. The spicy sauce complemented the ribs and the quality of meat doesn't get better than that. Galouti burger - the best indian style burger I have ever eaten. The kebab was spiced to excellence, the texture was fantastic and the taste buds were celebrating christmas. Must try !! Chicken tikka masala came inside a miniature london phone booth and tasted very english. Nothing to complain about it , but i have had better or rather say the more authentic spicy one. Amritsari fish - it was a perfect fish fry but it lacked all the flavours to be labelled amritsari. Then came the shisha, which was hand down the best shisha I ever had in India. We also had a jgerbomb which looked quite fancy, but sadly the testubes had a mechanical fault. For desserts we had sooji halwa cake, dirt pie, milky way and baklawa. Milky way and dirt pie had awsome liquid nitrogen presentation and tasted very good but my heart fell for the sooji halwa. Sweetness was balanced and played the role of an excellent finisher. Foodgasm !! Kudos to the young chefs who created these masterpieces. In a nutshell, this place comes with the tagline of ""satisfaction guaranteed"" and this brand will definitely emerge to be one of the best in india.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Angad Bagai,"Rated I've been wanting to try Farzi Cafe for ages, and despite living in Gurgaon, my first visit was to the CP branch earlier this evening. Farzi has been perhaps the most hyped restaurant in the Delhi NCR area over the past couple of years, and surprisingly, the food lived up to its billing. We tried a lot of dishes- Galouti Burger, Butter Chicken Bun, Tempura prawns with nimbu, duck samosas and a few more, and they were all really good. The drinks were different and innovative too. For dessert, we had the Parle G Cheesecake and the Milky Way Galaxy, but unfortunately found both overpoweringly sweet. The service wasn't spectacular, but this had to do with the fact that the place was packed and there weren't enough waiters. The biggest problem we had though was with the live Sufi music. The music itself wasn't the issue; rather, it was how damn loud it was. You couldn't hear your own thoughts, let alone the person sitting next to you. After over an hour of trying to shout over the music, we unfortunately had no other choice but to ask for the bill as quickly as possible and leave. An unfortunate blip on an otherwise good evening with great food.",Rated 4.0,2,2,??

Avani Gupta,Rated This review has been long overdue. I'm crazy about this place. The ambience is just perfect. The dishes extremely inventive. The touch of molecular gastronomy in the welcome shot is always a welcome surprise (dry ice and liquid nitrogen makes you feel like you're in a mad scientists lair =) ) . And the utensils in which they serve the food are truly unique. My only gripe is that it's become so popular that it's impossible to get a seat now!,Rated 5.0,2,104,??

Loved the ambience and dcor. Small touches like complimentary welcome shots, great presentation and good flavours added to my overall experience.However, I can't stress enough on the fact that how low Farzi is on quantity. No issues with quality, but low quantity effectively decreases value. And I can vouch for the fact that one can get better bang for the buck, especially in CP.Conclusively, it is definitely worth a visit or two.",Rated 4.0,1,46,??

Surbhi Samrat,"Rated I had heard a lot of good things about Farzi caf - the Indian cuisine with a Modern touch, the food presentation, the use of molecular gastronomy comparable to the likes of Indian Accent and Caf Lota and now that it had opened its branch in CP, I was really looking forward to visit the place. The start of our meal was quite exciting, when out came the complementary Mishti Doi shots, sitting quietly on a bed of liquid nitrogen, stirring a sense of anticipation and surprise in the air. The shots were topped with a bit of caramel and had a creamy texture, the taste of which resembled that of malai not very pleasant. Next up were their highly-recommended-for-cheese-lovers Margarita Stuffed Kulchas, which frankly didnt really float my boat. The kulchas were too small, so was the portion size, and the cheese didnt go well with the kulcha - fusion led astray. The soy chops, too, were a letdown. As much as I was impressed with the presentation stuff, the food was a setback. Verdict: Farzi caf is plainly overhyped, with a confusing fusion menu and, burning-a-hole-in-your-pocket prices for the unsatisfying and mediocre food. I dont get the deal about the odd number of portion size either. Although the art of food styling and demonstration is their USP, the food remains a major disappointment.",Rated 2.5,13,49,??

The moment we enterd here the staff escorted us to our tables as we have reserved them prior. We took about 20 minutes to decide on our dishes since the menu was so huge and We have to chose for the birthday treat from the menu ,so we took help of the staff to decide which is best for us. We all decided on 5 course meals that consisted of some Indian & Continential Food. Here's an overview of what we had: . Asparagus and water chestnut kurma, fresh coconut appam .

I recommend skipping out on dessert when choosing your courses unless you have a huge sweet tooth.I like the he yummiest Milky way / Big bang I ever had!

Astha Aggarwal,"Rated Monday afternoon and this place is jam packed, definitely they are doing a lot of things right. Things I loved- 1. Amuse bouche- It was a perfect start to the wonderful lunch with the right amount of fruitiness and foam. 2. Farzi Apple Foamintini- Our server recommended this drink, I was apprehensive regarding the same but I am glad I tried it. This drink is absolutely fabulous. A MUST TRY and the presentation is absolutely gorgeous (made me film the whole process :p). 3. The thai flavored Paneer tikka with the mayo sauce (sorry dont remember the dish name). Oh my goddd. This dish is absolutely fab. The paneer is succulent and so juicy with all the right thai flavors, the mayo compliments the paneer so well and lastly the lemongrass. Absolutely a MUST TRY!! 4. Asparagus and Water Chestnut Kurma with fresh coconut appam- This dish is absolutely fabulous. I am never ever able to finish my meals and generally get it packed. Despite being full, I just couldn't stop eating it. The water chestnuts and the asparagus with the coconut base was the perfect combination with crispy appams. 5. The milky way big bang- If you like art, this dish is for you. The whole presentation of this dish is absolutely fabulous. The chef himself comes to describe the dish and its so much of fun seeing the THEATRICS on the plate. A special mention to the coconut balls and the spice chocolate balls, I absolutely loved them. 6. The Chocolate Dirt- This dish is highly recommended for all the chocolate lovers. The gooey hot Chocolate on Chocolate mud with Chocolate crunch with Chocolate spiced balls with Chocolate brownie and fresh fruits, thinking too much chocolate?!! NOOO, the chef has done a fab job in balancing chocolate in this dish, despite having soo many chocolate elements, this dish doesn't feel too chocolaty. The fruits gives soo much of freshness to the dense flavors of chocolate. AN ABSOLUTE MUST TRY. 7. A special mention to the ""servers uniform""- absolutely loved it. The earphone made all the servers look super cool & cute. All and all a fabulous experience, feeling #farzified!!",Rated 4.5,108,408,??
Hero And The Sage,"Rated This new addition to the club of pretty restaurants in CP is sheer brilliance and worth a bookmark on anyone's list who's looking for not just food and drinks, but an experience. Easy to locate in the inner circle, the fancy ""F"" logo of the Farzi cafe will instantly catch your eye. The first thing that makes this a hit for me is how thoughtfully well the place is made. You can easily spot a perfect corner for yourself if you're looking for a subtle dine in or even if you want to chatter around with a big group of friends over some drinks. The cafe is set to happily confuse you if it is a fine dine or a pub, which is smart as it'll bring you back to the place over and over again. The lighting of the cafe is very well done, with the sun playing half the game till the evening and later being appropriately and beautifully lit up. The bar zone is beautifully made and is the first thing that hooks your eye as soon as you step out of the elevators. Tiny little elements like the typerwriters which are Farzi (fake) themselves, not only add up to the quirk quotient but stands up well to the whole idea of the cafe. It'll be criminal to forget mentioning how quirky and artistic is the menu here. Chart topper when it comes to having a quirky design. Not just the design, when it comes to what all it has to offer, the menu is quite vivid too. From going all desi to even things that seem to be weird with their names, the dishes wouldn't fail to impress you. I visited the place on a monday evening just to spend a good hour or two. We ordered for a Masala Punch pitcher. The drink failed to impress me as the blend of flavours of masala chai and vodka didn't really work well. The flavour of the masala chai was a little too overpowering and it would have been better if it didn't feel like I was having a bitter cup of tea. After the very first sip I knew I couldn't have gulped the whole pitcher down so we asked if they could replace it with an LIIT pitcher and they were courteous enough to value our opinion and replace it too. (Brownie points earned there). The other drink we ordered was a Margarita pitcher and it was one fine drink. Since it was an evening and we had already lunched, so we weren't craving for a lot of food even though a lot in the menu was screaming at me to order them. After the pitchers, we chose to try a desert or two and I wanted to know what the whole hype about the Parle G cheesecake was. Not disappointed at that definitely. The crunch of the biscuit complimented the cheesecake perfectly. Apart from that we ordered the Milk custard which served good to my sweet tooth. The overall experience I'd say was very fine and I'd surely rate it amongst my favourites in CP. Too clich to say, but yes, FARZIFIED!",Rated 4.0,9,43,??
Palak Maheshwari,"Rated The Farzi Caf is a great place. The dcor is minimalistic and classy. They play English pop music, viz., Coldplay, Adele, One Republic etc. Now let's come to the food. We ordered Vada Pav, Gupta Burger and Paneer Tikka. And all of these things were just wow! The Vada Pav is not like the usual one that you get as street food. It's a whole new twist to the dish. And the Paneer Tikka and its gravy was simply delectable. The mocktails were okay-ish. We ordered Grenny Mojito and Italian Smooch. Nothing too special there. (Hence, the 4 stars and not 5). But the prize goes to the dessert that we ordered: Chocolate Dirt Pile. Simply, mouth-watering. Have never had anything like that before! The chef especially came to explain all the ingredients to us and made sure we enjoyed it. The overall service was courteous, although our server seemed a little confused about the dishes on the menu. Overall, I'd say it was a well-spent evening.",Rated 4.0,19,15,??

We started with the Mac and Cheese Pakora Bites, which were basically cheese poppers. This was followed by the Farzi Fried Chicken, Amritsari Fish n Chips and the Delhi Belly Tikka. But the stars of the night were the Pork Chops and Apple braised Lamb Chops. Having eaten more than I had in the previous week and completely ruined my diet, I didn't regret it even a little bit.

We ordered coke, so nothing to review there :P the best part was that they offered us a complimentary drink, which was basically in a shot-sized glass. It was something which tasted of coffee, it was in a semi liquid form, and was just okay. The best part was their complimentary desert, gunjia, with dehydrated beetle leaves inside.

The dcor is pretty and modern at the same time. They have a huge separate bar section as well as a hookah area. Farzi is known as a fine dining restaurant but that is not all that it has got to offer. They also have a separate live band area, in night the chairs are moved and a dance floor comes into being, therefore transforming the place into a pub at night. The service is of another level, I found the manager to the servers to the bartender to be very courteous and polite. Special thanks to chef Nitesh Karla & Gaurav Chawla for amazing hospitality and for creating beautiful dishes. Farzi is known for its fusion food and they have got some brilliant delicacies to offer. Started with amuse bouche, that was as Bengalis call it, Mishti Doi shot. Dahi lovers will totally love this dish. In drinks I tried quite a few Farzi Cocktails which are their unique in house creation. First was Vodka Curry with Mango Chutney Foam, very tangy and tasty. Bottle Ka Gin, presented in a small glass bottle, orange in color and tasted amazing, must try. Snow White and Seven Dwarfs, I loved the name and this drink looked very pretty with white foam on the top. Three Musketeer, loved the presentation of this drink, it was a rum based cocktail in which flavour of orange was prominent and tasted amazing. Farzi Apple Foamintini, this cocktail is one of a kind and highly RECOMMENDED. It was a molecular cocktail, with foam coming out of it. The colour was green and looked spectacular and apple flavour was quite prominent. And lastly I tried, Kolaveri Banta, an absolutely delicious drink and highly recommended. Coming to the food, firstly I would like to mention that presentation of each dish is unique and amazing in its own way. Every dish is served in a different kind of cutlery, epicness this is. Began with Dal Chawal Arancini which was served along with Achar, Papad & Chutney. The modified version of dal chawal this is, the dal chawal balls tasted super and the chutney was wonderful. Mac N Cheese Pakora Bites, as the name suggests these are mac n cheese pakoras, it was spicy and tangy loved it. Both of these dishes are highly recommended. Next I tried Chilly Duck Samosas, and man were these amazing. I have eaten duck before but not quite in this form. The duck filing was soft and delicious, the layering of maida was perfect and it was spicy as well. This is a must try. Next I tried Tempura Fried Prawns which had Tobiko as garnish. The prawns were cooked in a beautiful marination and Tobiko is miniature fish eggs which looked very pretty. After that I tried Delhi Belly Tikka, it was pork belly served with roasted russet apples and Murraba Glaze. I am not that fond of pork but I feel in love with this dish. The pork was soo tender and yummy, pork with apples is truly a match made in heaven. Also sampled Chorizo and Scallion Paddu Yaki which was served with smoked tomato kut and Parmesan Appam. In the veg version tried Pinenuts and Scallions Paddu Yaki with roasted tomato kut and Parmesan Appam. Amazing take on the traditional South Indian dishes and were beautifully executed, these were a true delight. Also tried Goat Cheese and Walnut Tikki, my friend literally raved about it. Rajasthani Pyaaz Ki Kachori, they were small in size and looked so cute, the kachoris had perfectly right amount of softness and the pyaaz filing was delicious. Also tried the Vada Pao Farzified, sweet potato lovers are gonna adore this dish. They gave this Khandvi palate cleanser in between which was again a very unique creation. Coming to the main course, I tried Asparagus and Water Chestnut Kurma with fresh coconut appam. The korma was flavorful, the coconut flavour was quite potent in appam, also it was served with two types of chutnies which were delicious. Mutton Kuzhambhu with Madurai Podi Appam, just loved how beautifully the mutton was cooked, wonderful flavours and the appam was yummy. This dish is a must try. Tandoori Guchchi Risotto, by far one of the best Risottos I have ever tasted, hands down. It was perfectly cooked and had an amazing pepper kick to it, highly RECOMMENDED. The last main dish that I tried was Slow Cooked Baby lamb Shanks, other words Desi Ghee Nehari. The mutton was tender and succulent and the gravy was amazingly flavorful. It was served along with butter naan which was quite well prepared. Lastly coming to the desserts, tried the famous Parle G cheesecake and this dish is totally worth the hype. I am not that fond of cheesecake but I absolutely loved this dish. Next tried the Milky Way Big Bang, this is not just a dessert, it is literally art on plate. It depicts the various planets of the solar system and every minute detail has been taken care off. The best part is the nitrogen orange ice cream and how the dish is completed in front of you. This dessert is not to be missed. Also tried Baileys Lollipop, these were quite delicious. And lastly Nolan Gud Baklava which was served with Tender Coconut Granita. Again a very unique creation from Farzi Kitchen. The dish looked very pretty, the bakalava was made with one of the tastiest gur and it was pretty damn fabulous. And the final palate cleanser was a Pan Gujiya, that was pan coated with candy floss, again wonderfully amazing. My verdict, you absolutely cannot miss the amazing dining experience that Farzi has got to offer. From the dcor, to the drinks, to the food, to the presentation, nothing is short of epic.

Ananyaa Mazumdar,"Rated I'd been waiting for Farzi to open somewhere more Central since Gurgaon is pretty far for me (and a bunch of other people). We'd gone there for dinner on a weeknight. We were told there's 30-45 min waiting, I asked them to put my name down. When I came back after 30 mins I was told it'd take another 45 mins. That's when I lost it and went up to speak to the manager. He was kind enough to accommodate and give us a table 2 mins later. I wasn't too happy with the mismanagement thus far, since the staff downstairs clearly weren't keeping up with reservations very well. (This episode is the only reason I'm docking 1 point off their score). The Food: We ordered a range of things - prawns, butter chicken bun, mutton and parantha, chorizo pulao, noodle chicken biriyani, dosa, the vegetarian tikki burger (I might have missed a couple things) - all of it was absolutely fabulous. The flavours packed a punch, it was plated beautifully. We also had a pitcher of Sunta-Bunta which was quite nice, I look forward to trying the range of their Cocktails - they sound interesting, I just haven't had the opportunity to explore the bar menu well. Ambience: Love how well lit it is. The decor and seating are comfy. Not dingy at all. The music was blaring a little too loud the night I went though, so conversation was somewhat inconvenient.",Rated 4.0,6,6,??
Dhira Roy,"Rated Must say, it was a splendid experience dining here. The surprise element with each dish and the wonderful service struck the ""Wow"" factor right at the first instant. However, there were just a couple of glitches that I observed gradually, while dining, which, if worked upon, would make this place exceptional. Although the food looked great with fancy stone platings and the swipes on it, the food did not taste hot. Perhaps with the presentation, the focus on taste was compromised upon. Second, I think a separate staff exit from kitchen would neat up the fine dine look, they attempted to attain. Apart from this, the place looks brilliant, their island bar, at the centre is very nicely done and looks attractive and the service is impressive. Definitely recommended.",Rated 4.0,109,519,??
Saarthak Bhagra,"Rated I had never been to the Farzi(Gurgaon) so was way too excited to hear about the upcoming outlet in CP! Went there with a group of foodies, and I can say that I'm fully #Farzified They have nice decor and ambience, the only problem being the space..I went there on Thursday and it was fully packed..so got the Air Conditioners switched on :P they should really consider about expqnding the soace to stand in the current area, or there will bhasadd almkst every weekend! Talking about the food, I had all the veg starters like the Soya Chaap, The Chatpate Dry Fruits, and the Idlis were a show stopper starter that night :') Tried many cocktails including the Hardest one being Whiskey, the Chai Paani and the Bottle ka Gin! Mocktails were good to a level..though they were too sweet in taste. The main course inlcuded the small veg buns and the Chaat Kachodi, which were equally delicious! The desserts were iconic, including Parle-G cheesecake, the Milkyway candies and the Chilled Lollipops(or whatever they were :P) Loved every bit about it :) Gurpreet Singh Tikku Garag Keshaav Shivendra Goel Arjun Chaudhry Ishi Sandhu Kunal Relan Dilsefoodie",Rated 4.5,34,111,??
Priyanshu Kumar,"Rated FARZIFIED !!! the first thing I would like to state. I went to this place in E-block in Cannaught Place on their grand launch event, where I was invited by EazyDiner & Farzi admin. Mr. Vir Sanghvi was also there, made the eve more special. The much awaited arrival happened. The place is perfect for a party lover. open bar and mini stage adds on to the beauty of place. They have got ample space with window seating area a well for the people to have a glance at Delhi's busy lifestyle while enjoying their food and drinks. The grand launch was really grand, and I had all the fun i can have in terms of get-together, food, drinks, hospitality, dance etc. They have got lovely ambiance, with their signature style music in the background. The lights, comfy sofas, chairs are all really good. The decor are great as well. The staffs are courteous, friendly and smart....knows what they are catering, Very professional in dressing and addressing as well. Loved their way of mingling with us in a pleasant way, dancing with us simultaneously doing heir work with proper attention. The fiery show of the drink was also great .....and loved that drink too as I was the first one to try the same. Now coming on their foods and drinks - * CHAKHNA HAWKERS I had Kafir lime cashew nuts & caramel almonds, podi pop corn, clarified curry leaf platter, tawa sweet corn, masala torilla ......loved everything....and the way of presentation of the same was also really great...it was presented in a large basked with small bowls having these items in it. *STARTER I had mutton salli boti, braised lamb chops, smoked patther ke kebab, F.F.C - farzi fried chicken, tempula fried prawns. Again loved each and every starters of theirs, each one having their unique taste. FFC being the best...loved it...it came it a mini truck...loved the presentation again. *BURGERS/BUNS I had my hands on hand pulled rogan josh and Baikon & mint bun. Great at taste. *HOPPERS I liked Asparagus and water chestnut kurma. *DESSERTS I had Bailey's Lollipop, parle g cheesecake, milk custard, milky way.......delicious. *DRINKS I tried Farzi style santa bunta - loved the concept of bunta with alcohol base.tasted awesome as well. Bottle ka Gin, Farzi apple Foamintini - loved the foamy drink...refreshing it was. Three musketeer was average, could have been better. Chai pani & snow white and seven dwarfs are again some must try here. Vodka curry mango chutney foam & Wall bangers were great too. For the drinks, they do have large petrol pump type refillers for people in group to enjoy thier drink with blends and fun. loved being there and enjoyed the entire night !! thumbs up and a recommended place in CP.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Sahil Niyazi,"Rated Farzi Cafe turned out to be a revelation in the midst of the chaotic hustle bustle of CP's over hyped eating joints. it truly lived upto its hype of laid back but classy ambiance, molecular gastronomical delights and very courteous and knowledgeable staff. they not only serve but explain the whole concept behind every dish brought upto the table. for food recommendations although almost any blind pick is bound to hit a jackpot somewhere for sure but few recommendations are CHILLY DUCK SAMOSAS, RICE NOODLE CHICKEN BIRYANI and ALL THE FARZI SIGNATURE DRINKS. The price is comfortably comparable to the surrounding joint with an additional advantage of superb fusion delicacies. the cherry on the top was the mind blowing performance by the music band PANCHTARNI who set the floor on fire and rocked the whole joint and literally had to beg the audience to let them end the gig.

Saajan Goel,Rated Now i must say ... This place is just so good ! So a cancelled meeting landed up to this place i was happy we chose this place for spending some time. We entered around 4pm .. It was not very crowded. Seeing the weather my friend asked if they had an outdoor seating available.. But sadly they don't so we ended up near window. We just wanted some snacks as it was evening time so we ordered mac and cheese pakoras after reading reviews on zomato. Besides this we ordered vada pav and for drinks we went for famous farzi ok and we tried litchi panna desire. Must say i was amazed by the taste of mac and cheese pakoras ... They are a must try and vada pav came with a twist ... The pav was stuffed inside the vada. The drinks were ok .. I personally didn't liked them as much. Then we ordered chilli potato samosa and fries. These two items were also good. Overall i had a really good time. Staff service was quick and courteous. Pricing is quite decent.

NITIN MEGHLAN,"Rated Absolutely amazing. Although this review is long overdue, Farzi Cafe left me with a unforgettable experience with it's exquisite and delicious food, beautiful decor, warm ambiance, and attentive service. My friend and I was here on launch event 9january ,the moment i steped out of lift i just stop for a while , admired the pleasent aura and the amazing interior. We then go to the bar counter to try some new signature cocktails ,the bar guy suggested us to try Chai Pani first and then we moved to the next cocktail that is three musketeers, i must say its a perfect blend of whiskey and orange juice and crushed ice ball, the ice doesn't melt in the cocktail so the real taste of drink is preserved.The waiters were rotating diffrent food among the guest and their service was good As i am non veggie and my friend is vegan so we tried almost every rotaing dishes .Everything tasted great, but our top items were - Liquor - * Chai -Pani * Litchi panna desire * Three musketeers * Bottle ka jin * Farzi Ok Food - * Asparagus and water chestnut kurma, fresh coconut appam * Farzified Chicken (FFC) * Dalchawal Arachini * Tampura Fried Prawns *Baby cashew idli * Mac n cheese pakoda bites * Delhi belly tikka, roasted russet apples, murabba glaze * Bacon N Eggs, curry leaf and pink pepper appam. They have done some very good gastronony in their food. The perfect example of such gastronomy was Dalchawal Archini. The bar gus were really nice and adid some juggling to amaze us.

Well, That's The Twist. This Place Gives You Really Good Fusion Food. The Whole Menu Is India With A Continental Twist. I Had Amritsari Fish n Chips. The Same Old Good Fish And Chips With A Really Crunchy And Spicy Covering With Basil Mayo Dip. And The Second Dish Was Rice Noodles Chicken Biryani. We All Search For Good Rice To Prepare Biryani But Ever Thought Noodles Made Of Flat Noodles. Well, Here It Is.

Saloni Raheja - TheCravingSoul,"Rated 100th : Dear Farzi, you're the new love ! No place has been this terrific for me as yet. Located in the heart of the city Delhi - Connaught Place, Farzi is gorgeously decorated and lit. The glorious CP hub has a new entrant which offers impeccable variety in food and cocktails. A Huge bar welcomes you as you step in. They have special Banta maker machine and interesting vessels to serve. A separate seating for big groups and another separate area for sheesha. Quotes relating to food hangs on the walls which keep you involved while you wait for your order. DJ knows his job well and you'll love him for every track he plays ! Staff is well versed with the menu ; Courteous and serves quick ! From their interesting menu we had : Chaai Paani : Apple, Gin and Cinnamon mingled to create the most loved cocktail of the evening. Poured from a small kettle, cinnamon smoke hovers it. Interesting thing : its a cold drink ! Bubling Jaljeera : Served in a huge flask with edible ice in it, flavour of Jaljeera was prominent and tasted delightful. Bang Bang : Its a gang bang of few large portions of what all liquor( can't remember whicj all ) served in a barrel topped with Orange slice is all you need to get tipsy ! Farzi OK : Another great cocktail with Californian orange and Kaffir Lime leaves is a refreshing start. Other drinks we had were : Farzi Apple Foamitini, Litchi Panna Desire, Farzi Tina, Date me. Neither of them disappointed us. Before the food servings, we had Caramel Spheres : served with dry ice smoke, these small shots were fine. Dal Chawal Aranchini : topped with Achaar papad ; coated with crushed papad. A simple combo of our daily eats very well prepared and served. A must have ! Their mint chutney added extra flavours to its existing character. Rajasthani Pyaas Kachori : Tiny piece of kachori topped with jack fruit slice was indeed a little bundle of joy. Paneer Palak Quesallida : Like really? A successful fusion I would call it ! Spinach wasn't bland ( how it is ). Small circular Quesallida topped with pink leaf served with mix raita was a delight to eyes and buds. Mac N Cheese Pakora : Mac N Cheese can never go wrong and it rocked this time as well. But without the spicy dip, these pakoras couldn't be justified. Baby Cashew Idlis : Soft Baby Idlis served on scoop were far away from the southern spices. Good to taste. Mint Raj Kachori with Crsip Okhra And Mint Foam : Thick Curd, Wow mint chutney (as mentioned above) ,tamarind chutney and some stuffing into the kachori was la la la ! Topped with mint foam and crisp Okhra was a wholesome a delicious eat. Vada Pav : Reversely made - with bread inside and Mashed Potatoes covering outside ; this street food was remarkably made and well presented here. Served with Garlic Mint Chutney made us love it more. We had some Khanadvi ( a Gujarati dish made of yogurt + gram flour) flavoured pops in between. If you visit Farzi, desserts are a must. You got to save some space to their yummilicious looking and tasting sweet corner. We had : Bailey's Pops : Naam e kaafi hai I guess ! Must have. Milky Way : A Platter with nuts, caramel fudge, chocolate pieces, milk fudge upon which added is crushed solidified ice cream( using nitrogen ). Rabri kinda( not thick) is poured and it tastes HEAVENLY ! Must have ! Choco Dirt Pie : Mud chocolate + Slices of fruits + small chocolate pieces when mixed with chocolate syrup : DIVINE. It shouldn't be missed. An awesome dining experience . #Farzified of course ! Already excited for another visit. Best Wishes, Cheers !",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

I am not a fan of dal chawal so was kind of doubtful about it but the person who took our order told me to trust him & try it, i was like okay lets give it a try & it turned out to be amazing!! The food was very amazing! In the dessert we had chocolate dirt pie which was nice too it was cake kinda thing with strawberry, gooseberry, ganache & pistachio in it, i liked it!

The food was okay - but the service sucked big time. They mixed up orders for drinks and food, and getting the right order in part or full was waste of time for all. They need to buck up here fast, else heaps of other favourites have sprung all over CP. Food - experimental and good...but extremely small portions especially in purview of Amritsari Fish n' Chips (first time it came with 3 pieces...and the 2nd time with 4...weird!) and the mince and Dosai. The Chicken Tikka Masala had good portions but fell back on taste - as it was more like an average Butter Chicken from a neighbourhood dhaba. The Lamb Shanks stood out though.

Aishwarya Munjal,"Rated This review would confuse you as much as this place confused my opinion about it. On a Monday night it was semi jam packed. They are serving sheesha in one Corner which is not open air. The place was a little stuffy and claustrophobic, maybe because they were trying to maintain the temperature. But it wasn't very pleasing. Even though there are 5 people to attend to you and all of them promised as a table, we were just waiting at the bar for 10 minutes(with no bar tools to sit on). Then after a slight complaint we got an overwhelmingly warm response and were shifted to a table. Now to the food. We ordered the walnut and goat cheese tikki, margherita cheese kulcha and the rajasthani kachodi for starters. Th tikki was phenomenal. But the kulcha was too cheesy for its own good and lacked any sort of distinguishing flavour. The Rajasthani kachodi was also disappointing. For mains we had the mutton dish with malabar paratha, which I've had before and it's quite good. And I must mention, THEY GAVE US DIRTY CUTLERY. By this time we did not want to be difficult guests so I saved my rant for zomato. Food is what matters at the end, but I won't be coming back for that either.",Rated 3.0,55,187,??

Aparna Arya,"Rated My expectations from Farzi CP were in all honesty not too high when I walked in. Having been dragged here by some friends (under duress I might add) I was prepared to have a terrible time. But, I am glad I came and was proven wrong; and HOW! The place is very well lit, has a pub/ lounge vibe mix happening and is spread over the second floor of a store front on the ground floor (I forget the name of the store in my geriatric moment). We came on the opening night (first full operation day) and here is what I thought - the service is ok (not too slow, but not too efficient either), the seating is comfortable and thank god for temperature control (winter nights are the worst, where most restaurants turn the heat on and forget to ventilate, making it overly stuffy or claustrophobic in my opinion - not here though) The cocktails menu was sadly not available, but we were urged to try the mocktails menu; which since we were so sweetly asked we did the Farzi OK was my personal favourite, although I did try the Litchi Panna Desire, Strawberry Lemonade and Italian Smooch as well. Missed out on sampling the Chai Pani, which I will be heading back for besides sampling their cocktail menu as well. The first dish I tried ended up being what I will be returning to Farzi for again and again and again the Delhi Belly tikka pork belly barbecued with a murabba glaze and served with roasted russet apples, let me just say to clarify that I am NOT a pork lover, but if all pork tasted like this I would never eat anything else EVER. I pretty much demolished the whole portion by myself and thankfully none of my friends seemed to want to partake (hurray more for me ;) ) The next thing was the Pathar ke kebab which was slivers of mutton beaten to tender morsels of perfection served on a hot plate - this was OK, but again not a mutton lover either (red meat in general really except beef :D ) This was followed by the Malaya Prawns, which were served over idi appam the amalgamation of this combo if mouth wateringly good and the Prawn Roast served over coconut rice the spice from the roast perfectly complimented by the earthy sweetness of that coconut rice. Although a lot other food was served and devoured on our table, these were the gluten free options that I imbibed. Also, not to be missed were the palate cleanser chaach popsicles served for dramatic effect on a wooden tree with branches and the cotton candy version of the farzi paan (dissolved on the tongue). There was the option of eating rasmalai (the only gluten free dessert on the menu), but I chose to end my meal with the Farzi paan instead. Cant wait to return for the Delhi Belly (none of the negative connotations involved) as well as the Cocktails and off course the missing experience of the Chai Paani :)",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Anthony Philip,"Rated Best restaurant in CP if you desire exceptional service, I guess the menu is contemporary Indian fusion we tried couple of cocktails the flavour were unique though one needs an acquired taste to enjoy them. The highlight was the food, the dishes clearly displayed the hardwork that goes to create a unique affair. We had 7 dishes and 3 cocktails between three of us the bill was 5.5k, so that's reasonably great. Best of luck and Thank you Team FARZI.",Rated 4.5,4,111,??
Sonali Mahajan Garg,"Rated Been to their Cyber hub outlet and loved it and therefore was excited to visit their first outlet in delhi. The place is beautifully done with ample sitting options. It has a huge bar in the centre and was jam packed on Sunday evening. May be because of the crowd or because of the weekend the service was a complete let down (which is not a good impression for a new outlet in a place like CP where every day a new restaurant is opening up and hence quality of food and service is very competitive). Though everyone tried their best, lack of attention was there since for every thing we were trying to get the attention of our server!! The hostess at the entrance was very attentive and though there was a waiting of 20min minimum, she made us comfortable at the bar.the bar man too was very professional and helped us with the menu. Our ordeal started when were seated at the table. Our server appeared after 15min and that too when we tried really hard to get his attention for the food menu. The food arrived without any delay and without cutlery. Again we waited for a minimum of 15min to get the attention of any attender for plates and cutlery.The Farzi fried chicken in starter was really good and the barbecue sauce which comes with it is awesome. Again 15min for the food menu to place order for main course. Main course arrives on time and again with no plates and cutlery even though we asked the person who delivered the main course for the plates. we had to literally shout to get their attention again when nothing came even after almost 15min. The person who told us in the beginning that he will be our server for the night never bothered to visit our table even once. However the other attenders assisted us but that too when we really had to shout and signal them for assistance. The bill came and there was a food item wrongly charged to us. They corrected the bill and we paid accordingly. In Cyberhub outlet they give you palate cleanser etc after every meal, even in the reviews for this outlet people mentioned it,however we were not served anything... Maybe our server was not attentive but then this is not a kind of service we were expecting at all and therefore the rating of 4 instead of 5 just because of this.",Rated 4.0,102,82,??

Their service is impeccable with the staff on their toes to help you and forever smiling, unlike very few restaurants in Delhi. We were served by Mr. Saba and we couldn't be happier about our experience. We ordered the farzi ok mocktail- an interesting fusion of orange juice and Kaffir lime leaves followed by the ghee roast mutton boti- not authentic ghee roast but with their own twist it does work wonders on your palate. For the main course we tried the mutton with Malabar paratha which was cooked to perfection. And their complimentary candy floss paan sealed the deal for us.

SincerelyKangna,"Rated All those people who live in Delhi but are fond of visiting fancy outlets in cyberhub, well, I have a happy news for them, one of the outlets which caught a lot of attention that is farzi cafe, has opened its branch in Connaught place. So you can try all their signature dishes without worrying about gurgaon traffic or without struggling for a table on friday nights at the cyberhub outlet. Place is just huge and is located in E block in CP. Although this outlet is very new but it still has managed to win many hearts. Famous for its fancy looking cocktails and entre food items which are served with a twist is worth looking out for and still keeps people guessing of the magical key ingridents in most of the dishes. Usually jam packed during evenings, bar section is one place where you can manage to get a place to sit, no matter what time you visit this place. I am a huge fan of the dessert menu which farzi has on offer. One must look out for: Mac n Cheese Pakora, palak paneer quesadillas, Farzi-Fried Chicken, Goat Cheese Tangri kebab, tandoori Soya chaap and Paneer tikka. If you are fan of its cyber hub outlet, trust me this place will not disappoint you. Go pay your visit.

It's a very large restaurant having different seating arrangements. Heading to the menu...it's quirky n full of fusion. We ordered Mac n Cheese Pakoras, palak paneer quesadillas, Farzi Fried Chicken, Goat Cheese Tangri kebab, tandoori Soya chaap and Paneer tikka. The food, it's presentation matched to that of what we have seen on TV shows like Masterchef. I was dumbstruck seeing the delicacies.The restaurant offers few dishes based on molecular gastronomy which is enticing for first timers like us. We liked most of the dishes except for the Goat cheese Tangri Kebab. The cheese overpowered the entire dish n in a way ruined it. Prices are a little tad over though the food u r served, it's totally worth every penny. My visit is still incomplete...there few more dishes I would want to try. So I'll hv a couple of visits more very soon.",Rated 4.5,18,95,??
FOODSTER,"Rated Eyes lit up when I first heard the news of the launch of Farzi cafe in C.P, I cancelled all my schedules to be here with my foodie friends and there we were. On a Tuesday evening this place was alive and kicking. The 90 to 100 seater restaurant' space has been very well utilized. The grand and rustic interiors dominated with glass and wood, the huge bar section and a dedicated performance stage with a dance floor are the things you notice when you enter. The menu is fascinating, I have never visited their Cyber City outlet and my friends tell me that they have some new additions with the old listings. Sadly their liquor license had not arrived so we missed trying their electrifying cocktails. The server recommended us to try some of their mock tails namely LITCHI PANNA DESIRE, ITALIAN SMOOCH, FARZI OK and LAWA JALJEERA. The drinks were superbly refreshing. The lawa jaljeera is basically a cocktail but because of the absence of the liquor license they served it without alcohol. It was beautifully served in a tall glass with a stand with dry ice to give that bubble and smoke effect. Topped with fresh strawberries had a strong sweet and tangy flavor. Four of us ordered ample food to try out. First to get served were nicely composed amuse bouche, MISHTI DOI SPHERES which burst in your mouth and your appetites are instantly swollen. The first starter was the famous FARZI FRIED CHICKEN. Presented in a toy truck, Juicy drumsticks of chicken wings fried wheat flour batter with a crunchiness of poha. Then we had the signature DAL CHAWAL ARANCHINI, basically pakoras of khichdi topped with chutney and a mini pappadam. TEMPURA FRIED PRAWNS, NIMBOO MIRCH AIR, I am not much of a prawn lover, but I was delighted with this dish. Perfectly wok tossed prawns topped with a froth of lime. The show stealer was the DELHI BELLY TIKKA with ROASTED APPLES, MURRABBA GLAZE. The pork meat was unbelievably tender and had a sweet and sour taste accompanied with meetha achaar glazed roasted apples. The server recommended we try the coastal specialties which they have introduced in the menu here. MUTTON MADURAI with MALABARI PARANTHA, juicy and succulent lamb chunks wrapped up in a spicy masala. BHEJA FRY, CUMIN CORRIANDER APPAM, lamb brain cooked south Indian style served on top of appam and crunchy WATER CHESTNUT and ASPARAGUS KURMA with COCONUT APPAM too were delicious. The new dessert in the menu is MILKY WAY or the BIG BANG which was prepared by the chef in front of us. 9 planet shaped balls of different desserts served on a white milk chocolate melt was a feast to the eyes and the palate. We also had the PARLE G CHEESE CAKE which is also their signature dessert with thick rabri. The little things such as the amuse bouche, the palate cleanser and the way the food was presented does make a difference and leaves a smile on your face. Dining at The Farzi Caf was one of a kind experience and the place certainly deserves nothing less than a 5. I simply cant wait to come and dry their cocktails which will be available anytime soon. Must try: The Lava Jaljeera Delhi Belly Tikka with glazed apples Mutton Madurai with Malabari Parantha",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

These tiny spheres of mishti doi served on a chilling platter explodes in your mouth with a promise of things to come. Things such as -- Cocktails - Farzi Ok, a kaffir lime and orange juice concoction served in a mason jar but with freshness. The Italian Smooch, on the other hand, muddled with ingredients of a mojito with ginger ale and coke. Dal Chawal Arancini is served with a rolled up pappad on a bed of onion chutney. The north Indian flavor of Dal Chawal and Achar is so pure and flavorful. Delhi Belly Tikka and Roasted russet apples with murabba glaze is a must have here. A pork belly dish which is juicy, slightly sweet, sour and sticky. Its moist and has a slight tinge of anardana. The flavors are balanced well. Next comes the South Indian and Japanese fusion of Pine nuts and scallion 'paddu yaki' smoked tomato kut parmesan applam. Paddu in south India means rice balls. So here they served it on a tomato chutney (sauce) and dusted it with some parmesan. For more show info, click on link below ~ appetizingcity.blogspot.com",Rated 4.5,126,1082,??
Shweta Aggarwal,"Rated In the hustle bustle of the heart of the capital, Connaught Place, Farzi Caf is impressive, welcoming and open through the day. Farzi Caf has a charming ambience with beautiful handcrafted lanterns, open bar, DJ and stage for live performance with a view of the open outdoors, smoking zone, billboard playlist, and pleasant staff. Given the paucity of places in Delhi where you can get multicuisine, Farzi Caf scores with its fusion version of Indian cuisine and electrifying beverages with an unusual exhibition. A large part of Farzis charm comes from the incredibly warm hospitality that Chef Saurabh extends personally. He recommends Farzi OK in Mocktails, Dal Chawal Arancini in Starters, Ratatouille Bhaji with Maska Pav in Main Course, and Chocolate Dirt Pie in Desserts. Amuse Bouche, palate cleanser, and candy floss pan are complimentary and really artistic. The truly innovative cocktails, a carefully balanced blend of heady alcohol with different flavors, beg to be tried. The Farzi OK and Litchi Panna Desire are favorites in mocktails. Dal Chawal Arancini and the Rajasthani Kachori are the highlights, with all the accompaniments decorated. Baby cashew idlis, kafir lime gunpowder are simple and need more to create a magic. Mac n cheese pakora bites, mooli and green chutney lachha are smooth and easily relished with spicy chutney. Palak Paneer Quesadillas are yummy.The items are perfectly sized and priced well so you can order multiple rounds and still have space for meals. Kofte with Breads is a beautifully crafted curry with flavored bread. Most of the specials are excellent, the desserts will leave anyone in Awwwwwww. Chocolate Dirt Pie, Milky Way, Sooji Halwa, and Parle G Biscuit are exquisite and mind-boggling. Farzi is a WOW place experimenting with Indian cuisine with wondrous plating.

The Feast That's Life,"Rated Extremely popular across NCR for its unusual offerings which create a perfect illusion, Farzi Caf needs no introduction. After being a raging success at Cyber Hub, Farzi Caf recently opened its second outlet at the heart of Delhi- Connaught Place. Currently open only during the evening, the place was packed when we went there on a Wednesday, which clearly demonstrates its popularity. The CP outlet is much larger than the one at Cyber Hub, with plush wooden interiors, excellent music and a huge bar. The concept behind Farzi, was not just to make Indian food modern, but also to provide Delhiites with a place which serves excellent and unique food along with reasonably priced and innovative cocktails. The bar is clearly the focal point of the restaurant, and has been done up in a very interesting manner, with light bulbs which convert into glasses for drinks. The bar also has a banta machine, which they use to make six different flavours of alcoholic bantas. We tried the vodka-based Shikanji Banta, which was excellent, and is a must-try! Another interesting cocktail we tried was the bubbling jaljeera, which is created in a large flask, with edible dry ice put at the bottom, and the liquids poured on top to create a bubbling effect- a great spectacle as well as a tasty drink. We also tried a couple of mocktails- Farzi OK (a combination of California oranges and kaffir lime leaves- extremely delicious) and an apple and mint mocktail, which was really refreshing with a slightly sour taste. This drink was topped with a lovely mint foam. Before we started our meal, we were served Salted Caramel Spheres as an amuse bouche. They were laid out on a plate which had dry-ice, on top of which hot water had been poured to create a smoke-like effect. The spheres were meant to be had like shots and the combination of cool, slightly sweetened yogurt, with a light hit of salt really tantalized the taste buds. For starters, we had: Delhi Belly Tikka and Roasted Russet Apples with Murrabba Glaze: This was a spectacular dish- the pork belly had been cooked perfectly, it was juicy and moist and extremely flavourful. But what created magic on this dish was the incredible murabba glaze. It was slightly sweet, sour and sticky and had bits of anardana in it and all the flavours were perfectly balanced. Even the apples were coated in the same glaze and they tasted delicious as well. A must-have dish here! Mini Raj Kachori with Crisp Okra Salad and Chutney Foam: The raj kachori was really crisp, but it could have been slightly thinner. It was stuffed with a pumpkin and yogurt filling and was topped with a tamarind foam, so the sweet and sour flavours were balanced well. The kachori was served with some crispy fried okra, which not only provided a nice crunch to the dish, but tasted brilliant as well. Pine Nuts and Scallion Paddu-Yaki, Roasted Tomato Kut, Parmesan Appalam: A perfect fusion of South Indian and Japanese, this dish had a paddu (South Indian fried rice balls) but made use of some Japanese flavourings. The paddu was served with a roasted tomato chutney and some parmesan dust. Though the regular paddu is often slightly bland, this version had a lot of flavour. Mac n Cheese Pakora Bites: We all love pakodas as well as macaroni and cheese, so when these two things are combined together, how can one go wrong. These little balls had oozing cheese in it, and a crunchy exterior. Dal Chawal Arancini, Achaar-Papad-Chutney: What a brilliant innovation- converting the humble dal and chawal to Italian-style arancini balls, and rather than being coated with breadcrumbs, these were coated with papad pieces. They were served atop a fresh tomato salsa, and were topped with mini papads and green chutney, to make for the quintessential home-style meal of dal, rice, papad and chutney. F.F.C- Farzi Fried Chicken with Smoked BBQ Cream: The fried chicken was served on a mini-truck. It was crunchy on the outside and juicy within, and had been marinated well. It was served with a smoked bbq cream, but we would have preferred a sauce which was slightly spicier to be served with these. After the starters, we were served with a palate-cleanser of Khandvi Sorbet Lolly-pops. As weird as it may sound, they actually did taste exactly like khandvi and even had tiny bits of curry leaves inside. These not only refreshed out palates, but were extremely delicious as well. For mains, we had: Chicken Tikka Masala with naan: This is the national dish of Britain, and to pay homage to that, it was served in a red mini telephone booth. The chicken was quite nice- had subtle spices and was heavy on tomatoes. Mutton Irrachi Pepper Fry with Malabari Parantha: Melt-in-the-mouth mutton, in a typical Kerala-style pepper fry curry, served with flaky paranths. The mutton had the typical south indian flavourings, but was not overpowered by coconut oil, which was great! Bheja Fry, Fresh coriander and Cumin Appam: Our first time trying bheja fry, and we couldnt have asked for a better rendition of this dish. The bheja was shredded very fine, so that you dont feel the slimy and mushy texture while eating it, as a result of it, you are not repulsed by the thought of it, and are actually able to appreciate the flavour. Also, it went really well with the soft appam. No meal is complete without desserts, and here as well, Farzi doesnt disappoint. We tried: Ras Malai Tres Leches, Carrot Cream, Rose Petal Net: The ras malai was stacked, with layers of carrot cream in between, topped with a sugar net, all swimming in the saffron and rose petal flavoured milk. The ras malai pieces were really soft and spongy, but the carrot cream was clearly the star on this plate. Milky Way, Big Bang: This dessert is created live on the table by the chef who solidifies an ice-cream using liquid nitrogen and then breaks in into shards. The plate is covered with a myriad different items like chocolate pepper fudge, caramel fudge, edible flavours, nuts, cake pieces, crumbs, sauces, etc, so that with each bite, you get to taste different flavours and textures. This dessert is an experience in itself and should not be missed! We ended our meal with a Candy Floss pan, which had a covering of candy floss in the shape of a gujya, and was filled with dry betel leaves. An excellent end to a wonderful meal! When one dines at Farzi Caf, not only does one get to taste unusual flavour combinations, wacky presentations and exceptional service, one gets an excellent dining experience. At very few restaurants in the city, barring the five-stars, do you get to see such courteous, personalized service. The servers are very well-versed with the menu, and are not only able to give excellent suggestions, but are also able to explain the concept behind each dish, which, at a concept-driven restaurant like Farzi, is extremely crucial. Overall, Farzi Caf is a must-visit place for a really delightful and unique gastronomical experience! thefeastthatslife.wordpress.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Asides from the menu the server hands to you, be sure to check out the special menu on your table! I may have over-ordered...but here's what we ordered! - Makai methi tikki burger - Tandoori soya chops - Apam and mutton - Crumbed Fish with Desi ghee Hollandaise - Parle & cheesecake, milk custard, cookie dough essence - LITCHI PANNA DESIRE, ITALIAN SMOOCH (Mocktails) I enjoyed everything we ordered, especially the Benedict. My Elder Brother loved the Tandoori soya chops and LITCHI PANNA DESIRE, ITALIAN SMOOCH (Mocktails) says its the best he has ever had. Another one of the reasons why I loveeee FARZi CAFE Because this is great if you want to try other items on the menu or if you have a small appetite! Not only is the food delicious, but FARZI also treat their employees well with paid-sick leave and health benefits. Of course, this is why the menu prices are a bit steep. But hey! It goes to a good cause. They're also serious about their no tip policy here. There isn't even an option on the receipt when you pay with card, AND they emphasize it on the menu!

But then they more than made up with the food, that was Masterchef level in presentation and taste. Extensive use of liquid nitrogen across a variety of desserts and some amazing preparations or rather twists on the protein, the place will definitely become part of your favourites list in Delhi.

Nitika Kumar,"Rated Recently opened at CP, this place is at a prime location, easy to find. Attended the launch party for the place and couldn't have asked for a better reception here. We tasted quite a bit from whatever was available on their menu, and was happy with most of their food. The Delhi belly chicken was most amazing, the chicken being perfectly tender and moist. The Farzi Fried Chicken was great too. I tried their prawns which was okay, a little less spicy for our palette though. The Farzi chakna consisting of banana chips and roasted almonds was average, nothin. Spectacular about that. Their soya chap was tender and very tasty. You would like to pass their Rajasthani pyaz kachori and alloo chaat which were very average We tried a lot of their cocktails including Snow White and seven dwarfs, the three musketeers, chai pani and more . Most of their cocktails are worth a try and wasn't disappointed with any of their drinks. The extra .5 in the rating is for their cocktails, which definitely win over their food for me. For those with a knack to try out, please do go for the Bailey's lollipop. Loved it completely. The ambience of the place is very cool n casual and would make up for a great party place for CP. the great music that played that evening made up for an amazing experience. Even though the servers had a busy night for the launch, they were very polite and courteous and surprisingly prompt with their service. A big thanks to them for the amazing Farzi experience. Would love to visit again. :) Keep up the good work team.!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Anchit Jain,"Rated We were invited for the pre launch party/ sneak peek of Farzi Cafe, CP. After its success in Gurgaon, the owners finally bought their stylish experimental venture to the heart of Delhi - Connaught Place. First striking feature that we noticed was that the Farzi team decorated the whole E block inner circle where Farzi has opened announcing its opening. The entry is from the Da Milano store and can be a little tricky to find. So once you reach there, you are surely gonna bowled over by the contemporary and lively ambience of the place. We were shown the whole place and seated at the table of our choice and given the tasting menu specially designed for us. We being vegans opted only for vegetarian dishes. Out review of the food and drinks: Mocktails: 1. Farzi Ok - Going by the name, this was supposed to be their signature mocktail, though it turned out to be completely opposite and it was a simple orange juice with nothing special 2. Litchi Panna Desire - This is definitely their signature mocktail. You might have had aam panna a lot of times but do give this litchi panna a try and you are gonna fall in love with it for sure. 3. Apple Jack - This is a nice mocktail and can be given a try, but not at the cost of litchi panna desire. 4. Italian Smooch - It is what a simple italian smooch is generally, cola mixed with lemons. This can be easily avoided with better options available. So the mocktails section disappointed us a bit where the easy route was taken and no major experiments were done with the properties apart from litchi panna desire. Food: 1. Baby Cashew Idlis, Kafir Lime Gunpowder - Yes this the name of a single dish. These are mini idlis served with roasted cashews with high quotient of lime and South Indian spices. This dish can be heavenly for the South Indian lovers, but others can give it a skip. 2. Aloo Gnocchi Tikki Chaat - Its a aloo chaat made made out of gnocchi which is a pasta made out of potatoes. It is a nice experimental dish and is a must try. 3. Goat cheese and walnut tikki, basil chutney spheres - Again a long name for the dish. So before revealing any details about this dish, a small question. Have you ever wondered how a cracker taste? Here is a dish which will give you a proper taste of a cracker. This dish is surely recommended. 4. Tandoori soya chops, cheese and nut fudge, burhani cream - This is the best tandoori soya chap we have ever eaten. This made us forget all the chaps we had ever eaten before this. One of the best on the menu and surely worth a try. Highly recommended! 5. Rajasthani Pyaaz ki kachori, Masala Kathal, Aloo Rassa Reduction - Again a great dish offered by the farzi team. The kachoris just melt in your month and are amazing. Surely recommended! 6. Makai methi tikki burger, pickled cucumber, pepper ketchup - The presentation of these mini burgers took our heart away. They come in a cute little box. The taste is quite nice and different than the normal burgers and it tastes like a mix of vada pao and burger. Recommended! 7. Asparagus and water chestnut kurma, fresh coconut appam - This was a part of their newly launched section of the menu named the hoopers. This dish is an open dosa and again might please the South Indian food lovers and others might just want to skip it. Apart from this, they have newly introduced farzi fried chicken which was getting rave reviews from the people accompanying us. Desserts: 1. Baileys Lollipop - It was a chocobar on a lollipop with a little alcohol content as informed to us by our server. The presentation is what makes this dessert more interesting. 2. Parle & cheesecake, milk custard, cookie dough essence - This is the dessert which stands out of all. Its a brilliant combination of rabri, cheesecake, Parle biscuits and gems. Highly recommended! 3. Milky way - The presentation of this dessert will take your heart away. The chef specially prepares this dish on the table with using different gastronomical techniques and the result is magical. Recommended! The service was quite prompt and courteous with the highly trained staff ensuring that you have a wonderful experience (We ignored the small delays as they hadn't yet opened and still had to get used to the surroundings) Farzi cafe has left no stone unturned in satisfying its customers. This outlet in CP is surely gonna take the legacy forward and to new heights what the Gurgaon outlet has created for itself. Do pay this place a visit, its surely deserves it and its worth it!

Kamal Arora,"Rated Farzi has been my top choice to hangup with friends after office when in Gurgaon. I am so glad that now i can say the same when I want to be closer to home! After getting an invite from Eazydiner to be part of their launch at cp, I couldn't contain myself with joy. I happen to try almost all from their menu and here are my favourites from the night- Apam and mutton, tandoori soya chops, methi and corn burger and the show stopper of the evening, their dessert- the Milky way. I really appreciate that the menu here is alot different from their former outlet. The food tastes amazing and the service is bang on. I now would like to visit them again just to see how is the menu priced. To a superb evening- totally #farzified!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Vickrham (Vicky),"Rated Farzi Cafe is not just a restaurant. It is a phenomenon par excellence. I have always been a big fan of this place at Cyberhub. Now with its new avataar and additions to the Menu Team Farzi is set to create stiff competition for the other eateries in CP. Highly innovative dishes like Mutton chaap in Marzwangan korma glaze , Crumbed Fish with Desi ghee Hollandaise and yes my current favourite the Delhi Belly ( Pork belly) grilled with fat on the meat and voated in a a sweet achari glaze .Totally phenomenal , a must try dish. Then the Hoppers yes a full page in the new menu for Hoppers or aimply u can serving different things on an Appam. I loved the Bheja fry hopper a lot. The Farzi chicken fry is also a good innovation where pieces of chicken are mildly spiced and then batter fried. Not to forget the Patthar je kebab made out of Water Buffalo meat served on a Hot metal Dish , totally mesmerizing and yummy. There are many more things on the menu to be devoured. Farzi never disappoints you at all. The Desserts like the Chocolate mud and the Baklava tarts in Nolan gur are the new additions but the older ones are also to die for. Like the Suji cake and the Parle G cheesecake not to forget the Ras Malai tres leches rabri dessert. OMG almost drooling now. Use of molecular techniques to create gastronomical wonders in food as well as drinks is what Farzi albeit Zorawar Kalra is known for. The cocktails are again a wonder. Too much thought and work has gone into designing of cocktails. I am sorry but I forgot the names of the drinks I had ( probably got carried away) but the best ones as per me were the ones served in Long Beer glass and the Bulb shaped glasses with with a flamb twist. And yes the Farzi Tini has always been my favourite. Going back for more elaborate coverage of drinks again soon. The most remarkable point I realised W's that FARZI CAF CP is serving the cheapest booze in the while area. Yes the pricing is so competitive. It's a great combo of Cheapest Booze with the Best Food.Quite an unusual combination. People have welcomed Farzi Caf to CP with open arms as I have seen myself , how crowds were thronging the place even on weeknights. I congratulate them for their success.....Cheers foodmaniacsborn2eat.blogspot.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Dr.Trishnika,"Rated So the question is -Was I #farzified? Well by my review you can judge my answer. Starting with how to reach ..I took the cheapest n convenient metro. Took the Gate 4 exit that's it. FARZI IS GLOWING thr. No hanky panky of searching. Starting with Interior - retro wooden cafe. With awesome creative lighting. With bar in center and music band at one corner . Did I miss something . Oh yeah they have cozy sitting place with window on the ride part of their cafe. I guess it's mostly for private . Dim light soft music with amazing weather yeah its pretty awesome. So I was a part of their opening with big fat invitation from @lbbdelhi. The menus were restricted so I can't comment on all. So before we started I was given something unique for mouth cleansing. With the dramatic smoky effect I was presented with cute mishtidoi shots Starting with mocktail- I loved the farzi okay and the litchi Panna desire. It's a must try. Cocktail -chai pani and some apple thing I don't remem exactly it had the creme topping was something unique and fabulous . Starters - the truck loaded with smoked bbq chicken .omg it's so so so crispy and nice. With popcorn n fries everything was perfect in that truck. Though the mutton wraps was lit spicy. The tempura fried prawns were equally good Hoppers -Veg had few amazing appam dishes(asparagus with chestnut walnut something) and the idli was a new north Indian way cooked. Cheese and walnut tikki.I liked those too. It can b veg delight. Tandoori soya Chop is like the show stopper amongst all Buns - I loved the mutton burger . It was the best . I totally totally loved it. Other few burgers were packed in amazingly cute suitcase . Nice tech though. Dessert - well as they say all s well that ends well. I can't choose one here cz all of them were amazing . Parley G cheesecake; bailleys lollipop and the gnocchi at spade can get u into a trance. (But somehow I didn't like bheja fry it was buttery .nothing wrong with the taste.just the fact it's brain something .I really didn't appreciate that) Well the friendly staffs ,welcoming people and beautifully organized event made it a brilliant night for me",Rated 4.5,26,124,??
Gurneet Kaur,"Rated After the successful outlet at Gurgaon, Farzi has opened its first outlet in Delhi and what better location than CP! I was here for the Eazydiner's event at Farzi and boy what an experience! I have been a regular at the Gurgaon outlet so when I heard the news about Farzi in CP , I was jumping with joy. The moment I entered, I knew that I would be #farzified! There is a huge seating area with tables right next to the bar, stage(yes there is a stage for live band performances) and private area. The best thing is that there are so many new items on the menu that there is always room to try something new! Before I start talking about the food, I have to appreciate the staff at Farzi. Such hospitality just amplifies the experience. They were so friendly, fun and had a deep understanding of the dishes, their ingredients and the preparation. The entire place is so high on energy that it reflects in the little details and leaves you a delighted customer! I tried the following cocktails: 1. CHAI PAANI It for me was the best cocktail of the night! It had Gin, Apple,a hint of cinnamon. It was topped by Cinnamon smoke to give it that extra kick! Do insist on seeing the drink being prepared while you are present! You can't afford to miss it! 2.FARZI APPLE FOAMTINI Wasn't sure of the addition of apple in my cocktail but the flavors were so balanced that I actually liked this one! Again full marks for the presentation. 3.THREE MUSKEETEAR This was a favorite among everyone at the table. Try it and you won't regret! For the food, I ate the following: 1.CHAKHNA HAWKERS Farzi has a special chakhna range including Kafir lime cashew nuts & caramel almonds ,Podi pop-corn,Tawa sweet corn among others. The tawa sweet corn stood out among the rest with its excellentflavorswith such simple ingredients. 2.DELHI BELLY TIKKA This is their specialty and must try for all pork lovers. So succulent with subtle flavors! 3.TEMPURA FRIED PRAWNS This was cooked in a yummy spicy sauce making it one of the best prawn dishes I had in recent times. One of my friends insisted on me trying it and I am not complaining! The prawns were cooked really well and the portion size was impressive. 4.RAJASHTHANI PYAZ KI KACHORI Never knew kachori could taste so good! This was relished by the non-vegetarians as well. With just the right amount of spices and pyaaz, I wish there was more of it! 5. TANDOORI SOYA CHOP This for me was the STAR DISH. Imagine how good it was if I liked it more than the other amazing dishes! The burhani cream was made of garlic and curd and elevated the dish to another level! For the desserts, I tried : 1. BAILEY'S LOLLIPOP Reminded me of my childhood days but with a twist ! Bailey's with lollipop! 2. PARLE G-CHEESECAKE Cheesecake with parle-G and rabri and gems! Everything in one plate. Not a big fan of Gems/ Parle-G so didn't 'love' it unlike my friends who couldn't stop raving about it 3. MILKY WAY MUST try! Someone recreating the entire Milky Way on your table that tastes delicious! Farzi is perfect for those chilling scenes with friends because there is no doubt that Farzi is going to be the most happening restaurant in CP! Interestingly, I went here with my parents and they loved it! Go there for an experience and get Farzified!",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
