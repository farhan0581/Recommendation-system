Nikita Arora,Rated Great ambience. Great food though a little highly priced. They have a huge variety of drinks menu both cocktails and mocktails which is great for both drinkers and non drinkers. All the chefs special especially the rogan josh are great.,Rated 4.0,7,85,??
FoodieDiaries,"Rated Got a chance to be here this Valentines day luckily, and what a treat it was. I had a reservation made as it was a special day and also a sunday :) The place is dimly but nicely lit and had a nice V day balloon decoration all around. They have 2 kinds of seating , with high chairs or with couches. I took a look around and we settled for the couch seating and waited for the menu. We ordered Liit to drink as smoothies were not in stock, along with chicken steak and basic chicken in the main course straight away because it was already 4pm and we were starving. The drink was really good and unlike usual liits had some good tang to it. Both the chicken dishes were yumm. Chicken steak comes with grilled veggies and mashed potato and is quite filling. 3 people can have a meal in these 2 dishes. Overall a great experience and a definite try even when u stay too far from CP :) Cheers!",Rated 4.0,90,363,??
Saurabh Kochhar,"Rated Went there last night, I did my booking 2 days before I went there.But the attitude of the staff regarding my booking was shocking.. After 15 mins standing in front of counter and showing my name for booking on there register. They gave me a high chair ( as I booked in for sofa seats). Staff was so arrogant in telling me that u should be happy that they are giving me seat. Food was good Most of drinks in the menu were not available. I guess staff should be more polite to there customers..",Rated 2.5,5,0,??
Nikita Aggarwal,"Rated Town house cafe , Situated in N block with other named restaurant. On 2nd floor , cafe has occupies a huge space with 2 sitting area to choose from , one is a long running bar area , with wooden high stools and comfortable sofa's with dingy light keeping privacy . Another adjacent place has tables with wooden stools and side bar with comfortable huge sofa for hosting large group. There is also a place for the small stage where live artists perform on Bollywood Wednesday nights and live band on Friday nights. What you notice about the place is running wooden interior all over , large arches cushioned with dark bottle green. Coming to food , I tried : Celery Infused Mozzarella Sticks : Scattered all over the plate , with no presentation to be seen , the mozzarella stick was cheezy but quite sweet for my taste buds. Next is Dahi ke kebab : Quite delectable , presented in done way. I really loved the way it melted and coriander mint chutney was a perfect compliment. Panner tikka , huge chunks of paneer perfectly flavored though. Tried House Fantasia Pizza (veg) : Pleasing it looked , so does it taste , only thing offbeat was sweet cheese taste. But ample amount of cheese and considered amount of veggies. Coming to main course , I tried biryani and dal makhani , palatble dishes , with not so high hope on north india , i was amazed the flavors intact in dishes. At end , it's a great place for catching up with few drinks or looking for a lavish food hunt. And defiantly visiting next time.",Rated 4.0,47,193,??

Chetna Kaushik,"Rated We went to the Townhouse Cafe for a special promotion of a cosmetic brand. The Townhouse Cafe is located right near the Janpath road. It is a 5 min walk from the Rajiv Chowk metro station towards the Cannaught Place market. The restaurant is on the first floor and when I entered I had not expected such a big and, at the same time, cozy place. A quick run around to survey the area suggested that the area is divided into 3 parts where one is the private area, the second is a more family area and finally the one where we sat meant for large gatherings. Considering the whole black and gold decor was in to attract a very suave crowd, it pretty much nailed the ambiance. I loved the interiors, but it was only later that I realised we needed a little more light if I wanted to take good photos. That problem was solved very easily by the waiters and they opened up the nearest windows to let in the sunlight when the food arrived. I must appreciate that the staff was very courteous and well behaved and helped us with all the ordering as well as drink suggestions according to palate and taste. We started off with the drinks and I tasted the Red Lemonade Mocktail. It was a very sweet watermelon based drink and nice to taste. Next I tried the Sinful Apple Town Sour. I cant decide what floored me more, the theatrics or the taste. The drink is something I would love to go back to again. Then I tried their Red Wine Sangria which was nice. I am more of a light wine drinker so I took the White Wine Sangria which I ordered again as it tasted amazing. Now, let us talk about the starters : 1. Celery Infused Mozarella Sticks : These were very simple. The mozzarella sticks tasted nice and were more on the sweeter side but for me the sauce balanced it well. 2. Dahi Ke Kebab : Not a fan of this dish. It had slightly more salt for my palate and did not taste the way I wanted it to be and I believe I have had better. 3. Multani Paneer Tikka : Very nice tasting and the accompanying chutney made the taste even better. Paneer was soft and nicely infused with the spice. 4. Corn Pepper and Salt : A very decent dish and I loved how crispy it was. Another dish I would definitely go back to. 5. House Fantasia Pizza Vegetarian : It was a very nicely done pizza with a thin crust and the amount of veggies was amazing. 6. Murg Malai Tikka : A very nice and creamy dish balanced beautifully with the spices. I think it was definitely one of the stars of the day for me. 7. Chili Chicken : The dish was nice and the vegetables were nicely done. 8. Mutton Seekh Kebab : this was arguably the best dish I had. The mutton was perfectly done and the spices were well enough to make it a delectable dish. Time for the main course : 1. Red Sauce Pasta : this dish was so much spice and amazing sauce that me and friend kept raving about it. In fact, we went back for more servings of this. 2. White Sauce Pasta :This is more of a cheesy dish and although it was good, it wasnt exactly a dish for me. 3. Butter Chicken : The chicken was nicely dine and the gravy was perfect. I tried it individually and with the rice and tasted amazing in both ways. 4. Mutton Rogan Josh : I think their mutton is a specialty. This is the second mutton dish and it was perfectly done. Definitely a must try for non-vegetarians. 5. Dal Makhani : Simple dish with no fuss, it was nice accompaniment to the biryani. 6. Chicken Biryani : This is another dish that I loved. The rice was fragrant and the chicken peices were very well cooked. 7. Brownie with Ice Cream : A very simple dish to the extent of non-impressive. The ice cream was not too good and the brownie was average. So, all over The Townhouse Cafe is certainly a must visit and their starters and cocktails are totally worth any ones time.

Adeetya Ingenious Uberoi,"Rated This a place to be on friday night aswell on saturday night, this is exclusive and great ambience and food us excelkent but not for everyone its bit high on price but worth it, its my friend place the interiors are great,The dj plays awesome songs. And events here are too good.",Rated 4.5,35,186,??
Ankita Banerjee,"Rated I was invited to this place for a food and beauty bloggers meet organised by Suchana Bera . The place is divided into various sections. The bar area is separate along with red coloured booths which have been designed keeping in mind the privacy quotient. Another section is designed with huge wooden frame which creates quite an impressive hallway. The seating area is huge and has extremely comfortable couches. They definitely need more light and if the gigantic wooden windows havent been opened it would have been quite difficult to click the pics. The service is really fast and the servers are really courteous and quite knowledgeable regarding the menu they were serving. In mocktails, I tried Red Lemonade which was a watermelon based drink, quite nice in taste. In cocktails, I tried Sinful Apple Town Sour, which was their in house variation of whisky sour and what a molecular delight it was, highly recommended. Long Island Iced Tea, classic cocktail well made. Also tried Red wine Classic Sangria which was beautifully made. The Lynchberg Town Lemonade, I was intrigued about this cocktail because it was whisky based, but man the hazelnut in it just killed it for me. Didnt like it at all. In shots I tried No 4 and 5, and No 4 became my absolute favourite, as pepper flavour was quite potent in it, absolutely my kind of drink, must try for spice lovers. Shot No 5 was subtle in flavour but nonetheless tasted good. Coming to the food, in veg starters I tried, Celery Infused Mozzarella Sticks, which tasted sweet but wasnt bad in general. Corn Salt and Pepper, the flavours were nice but it was a bit too crispy for my liking. In non veg starters I tried, Murg Malai Tikka which was very soft and yummy. Chilli Chicken, the chicken tasted really good, it was quite well prepared. Mutton Seekh Lahori, these kebabs were so flavourful, I liked this dish quite a lot, highly recommended. Herbed Fish Fingers, crispy from outside, soft and juicy from inside, absolutely perfect. Also tried House Fantasia Pizza both veg and non veg variants. Both of them looked pretty as a picture, the crust was well cooked, ample amount of cheese and toppings were there, very well made. Also tried the red and white sauce veg pasta. I preferred the red one over the white one, it was really well made. Coming to the main course, tried Dal Makhani, which was very creamy and delicious. Butter Chicken which was again really well made and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Mutton Rogan Josh, the gravy of which was quite flavourful but the mutton needed a bit more cooking. Ate all this along with Chicken Biryani which was truly delicious. Also tried Tandoori Roti which was quite good. Lastly In dessert there was Brownie with Ice Cream, it wasnt the best brownie I have ever had, but it wasnt bad either. So my verdict, Town House Caf definitely deserves a visit for their spectacular ambiance, amazing cocktails and some delectable dishes. spiceslicebite.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Neelaakshi Piplani,"Rated Located in the outer circle, Townhouse cafe is one name which indeed has beautiful interiors. The red cabins have been designed keeping in mind the exclusive dates couples want to have. The super Comfy couches forms another section which is perfect for chilling with your group of friends. Must have's from the starters section- Dahi Ke Kebab, Fish Fingers, Crispy Mozeralla Sticks, Chilly Mushroom. The Veg and Non veg pizzas were just decent and a little too soggy and bland for my taste atleast. The White Dove which is a mix of White wine, vodka with banana topped with poached apples is one of the best sangria's I have tried till date. My Favorite. They have a wide range of cocktail menu and shots designed keeping in mind the cocktail lovers. The Veg Biryani,Dal Makhani and Butter chicken were another set of outstanding dishes served in the main course. The brownie with ice cream did not resonate with my taste bud. The brownie was undoubtedly soft and creamy but too sweet. Overall, the food service, presentation and ambiance is a win win.

Kats,"Rated So it happened to be an invite by Suchana Bera for a beauty and food bloggers meet. It was a launch event of Clear Face range of beauty products at The Town House Cafe, so basically ladies day out. A huge place with different seating arrangements to crater your needs. Dim lights creates a warm environment to enjoy some special and leisure time. Coming to the Food & Beverage section: Though many guests ordered many drinks but I was happy sitting in the corner sipping my Sangria. Red or White your choice, both are going to lift your spirit. For starters we had:( =Recommended) Corn Salt and Pepper: Crispy Corn with onion to give extra crunch was made well. A nice companion to your drink. Celery Infused Mozzarella Sticks: As a Cheese stick it was good but couldn't find the celery thing in it. With the dip it tasted very good. Multani Paneer Tikka: The best among all the Vegetarian starters. Soft Paneer and the aromatic spices together came out very well. Mutton Seekh Lahori: Though the kebab was a bit dry but the flavours were coming out so well that a bit dry didn't bothered. Herbed Fish Fingers: Soft fish batter fried. Perfect crunchy outside and soft fish inside. With the Tarter dip was lip smacking. The Chilli Methi Seekh: The flavour of methi was dominating and somewhere made it bitter. Chicken Pizza: Perfect as a pizza should be. A balance of Cheese and Toppings made it yummy. Pasta Arrabita and Alfredo: Both were made in Penney. Arrabita was a bit too tangy for my taste bud but Alfredo was made to perfection. Dal Makhni: Rich and flavourful dal. Perfect amount of Cream and mild spices made the dal amazing. Butter Chicken: Though I never liked butter chicken for some reasons, but this place really do make some really good butter chicken. Tender chicken pieces with the flavourful gravy was too good. Mutton Rogan Josh: A spicy gravy to trickle your taste but. The gravy was good but the Mutton pieces were a letdown, hard and chewy. Chicken Biriyani: Had this good Biriyani after a very long time. Super spicy aromatic Biriyani with tender chicken pieces will make you fall in love with it. Methi Malai Paneer: Rich creamy gravy with soft Paneer. The medley of methi, Paneer and rich but mildly spiced gravy altogether was delicious. Finally ended with Brownie with Vanila Ice Cream. Nothing out of the world about it but was good. Overall a good place to eat drink and celebrate...... Will definitely be visiting again.",Rated 4.0,91,651,??

Non-Veg Starter- We have had Murg Malai Tikka, Chilli Chicken and Mutton Seekh Kabab. Chilli Chicken was bit too salty, while Mutton Seekh Kabab was tasty. And yes, we had main course too. Yay. Main Course: Dal Makhani and Panner were really good in veg. For Non-Veg :Butter Chicken and Chicken Biryani. Yummy. Desserts: All time favourite Brownie with Ice Cream.

Chicken chatkara, Honey chilly potato, Kanda bhaji - taste good, cooked, seasoned, presented nicely. Arrabbiata - overcooked, no veggies, olives not sliced, sauce (dry & slushy, won't call it a sauce), could do with less pepper. Bruschetta - breads not toasted, toppings had a nice fragrance.

Arrabbiata was fairly tangy and despite of excessive pepper content tasted appreciable. For the main course we had Dal Makhani, which was creamy, buttery, flavourful and Methi Panner Masala : the most flavoursome dish I ate . Breads were fresh. { I am slanted for places which serve GOOD Indian Main Course } Among all the cocktails we had, red lemonade stood apart. Recommended.

Dr.Trishnika,"Rated So after my traumatic heart break , I thought of giving myself a huge Good Food Break. Walked with 35 chicks in an event organized by Dilsefoodie with cute and pretty organiser Suchana Bera . And ofcourse my lovely ladies Dr. RadhIka Agarwal Ankita Banerjee and others whose handle I have no clue about... Let's start with Interior - huge wooden frame .gigantic windows with blinders and enormous space to shut 250 ppl easily with cocktails. Well the interior is pretty good. Looks more of gothlic architecture but they definitely need to put more lights. One won't know what they are eating at such lighting. So yeah only minus point is lighting. Ambience & Staffs - nice and warm welcoming place. None will face finding a staff unlike my bercos experience .. Straight away to Mocktails and cocktails - well I can't complain about their mixology. Pretty amazing .each one was kind of its own. Be it watermelon mint lemonade or orange town lemonade or wild sex at house or town house fruit bull. I lived the sangaria white wine and red lemonade plus town house fruit bull. Martini was kinda like benadryl taste . Okay but m not much of alcoholic dentist so can't appreciate much. Over all I kinda liked most of their mixes and mocktails I entitled. Starters - the herb fish finger will melt in ones mouth. It should me like the signature dish. Chilli chicken was equally good . Murgh malai tikka and mutton seekh kebab was good. Not super amazing but good. Veg ones I tried multani paneer tikka is pretty much ador. Corn salt and pepper and dahi kebab was somewhat okay . The starters were not super amazing but yet will leave good impression in your tongue. Chicken pizza can be a try there. Well I was too full for main course. So I shud stop here... Precisely it's a good place. Can be improved the food taste . And they have brilliant plate designing. .that's like plus point.",Rated 3.5,26,124,??
Ishleen Kaur,"Rated First of all, I am so glad I decided to come into this blogging business which takes me to such great places! So I Visited the Townhouse cafe on the pretext of some bloggers event, and yes, townhouse cafe did take me up with surprise! such a wide-spread place to come, sit, relax and just have the time of your life! Super classy and warm ambience,and such nice music! For starters I did try the afghani malai tikka which i found pretty average for the price and some peices of the chicken were also a tad bit undercooked! Next i digged into the fish orly which i found really spectacular! the fish was moist, and crunchy on the outside while incredibly soft and gooey on the inside! Accompanied with a cute little pot of tar tar tip and a handful serving of chips, this dish appealed the most to me! I also tried the chicken pizza and the dahi kababs which were pretty good! For drinks I remember ordering ""The wild sex on Townhouse cafe"" something which was made of peaches and orange juice, vodka and all the good stuff! Next i ordered a virgin mojito infused with bacardi rum, which i hated! And this is the only thing i regret ordering! In the main course came Butter chicken, which was boneless and the peices were really tender and perfectly complemented the flavours and the texture of the curry! One thing which i loved was the vegetable biryani (and being a hardcore non-vegetarian, it took a lot of guts to call a veg biryani my favourite)! I decided to drizzle it up with some Mutton Roghan Josh Curry and it was the yummiest thing i had ever had! The white sauce pasta with mushrooms seemed pretty bland to me, but yeah, some may like it nonetheless! Finally, came the desserts! And though we had only one option and that was brownie with ice-cream, it was ah-mazing! Like spectacularly ah-mazing! The brownie was all crusty at the top and such gooey at the middle with just the perfect amount of nuts to it! drizzled with some molten chocolate sauce and a scoop of ice-cream--the desert experience was orgasmic for my sweet-tooth! quite literally!",Rated 4.5,4,1,??

Sonal Mahendru,"Rated With social media always in awe of one or the other new-entrants, there are only a few restaurants l dearly adore and recommend! The Town House Caf made a promising entry and is consistently delivering excellence on table. Well, pretty much the reason I strongly recommend a visit. Be it birthdays, a date, get-togethers or just random meetings, The Town House Caf has its ambiance set to complement just any mood! The USP of this place is its different settings, different moods and different sections, which makes it an ideal spot for anyone. And, serving cuisines from round the world on its platter, TTHC does it better than most restaurants in Connaught Place, without burning a hole in your pocket. By now, I have visited the place thrice and nonetheless the place never ceases to surprise me. They serve the best HOOKAHS! Super fancy designs and oh-so-amazing flavors. My pick Commissioner Flavor. Not to forget, the food served here is nothing less than art! A lot of efforts have been put-in to design each dish, cutlery and the spot-on flavors, which clearly shows. A special shout-out for the cooking team, which puts a smile on our face - every time we visit. I tried the LEBANESE PLATTER, SOYA TIKKA, TANDOORI VEG PLATTER, PANEER TIKKA PANNINI, SPAGHETTI IN RED SAUCE AND THAI SPRING ROLLS. My personal favorites are Lebanese platter and spaghetti, but honestly, each dish was a perfect 5/5. The soya tikka however could have been crispier and spicier, which can be customized as per your liking, if you request it before placing the order. I cannot recall the name of all the drinks, but the one with pomegranate was divine! Highly recommended. We ended our meal beautifully with Chocolate Brownie with Ice cream. To my surprise, I was served an exclusively made warm cake as it was my birthday as a sweet gesture from the management. Much appreciated! P.s.: My reviews are usually much more detailed and food-centric, but theres not much to write this time except boasting my happiness to finally find such a fantastic place at a convenient distance from my place. yummydelhi.wordpress.com",Rated 4.5,80,3911,??

Time taken in bringing the order. 2.billing-The bill was divided into 2 not sure why It had created a lot of confusion.we were a bit intoxicated and by mistake i paid more (i m sure about 100 rs extra atleast ) to them on my second visit.But no body came to return or confirm that even they didnt bring back the bill this was very strange for me.

FOODSTER,"Rated The Townhouse caf is another brainchild of restrauranteur Priyank Sukhija and surely Delhi has been in love with his concepts. The strategically located gastro pub in outer circle of C.P is a heaven for people who want to party and drink. The caf is located on the first floor and has displaced The Warehouse caf. The plush first look surely impresses. It is segregated into two sections one with a comfortable sofa sitting and a stage for live performances, another one has a long bar and a combination of cabin styled sitting and high rise tables. The colonial style dcor is imprinted with chicness and vibrancy. Huge mirrors provide an illusion to this place with wooden arches covered ceilings give a medieval look. The lighting is dim with wall mounted lamps and chandeliers. The food and drinks menu is extensive and covers the best of cuisines with an array of drinks. I would recommend you to play it safe while ordering as food might not quite satisfy you. Five of us ordered a few beer pints in drinks. In food we had chicken malai tikka, peri peri chicken pizza , mutton seekh kebab , mutton galouti kebab with ulte tawa ka parantha , veg spring rolls , and pasta alfredo. Pizza, chicken tikka and galouti kebab were decent, but pasta and spring rolls were a huge disappointment. The music on that particular night was outstanding. You really dont bother about the food when such amazing band is playing in front of you and you are down couple of beers. The focus certainly is stolen from the food and the mood shifts to party mode. It was sheer madness as the whole crowd was up on their feet and dancing. The service I believe was extremely week. I am sure its tough to handle so much rush, but completely ignoring the guests need was not acceptable. We had to skip our dinner to find ourselves a better place when we were completely ignored when we wanted to place our main course order which was a big disappointment. Overall, I would highly rate this place when it comes to drinking and party, but would certainly not recommend it if you want good food and service. I believe this place might be quite dead when there is no live band performing while on the performance days its fully crowded. I had a great time out with my friends, that what mattered the most. So step into this venue one fine evening with your friends in dancing shoes and be assured to have a great time",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

One should must try dal makhni and spring rolls. The drinks also complemented the fine taste of the chicken snacks. The bar section is also very cool! If you want to go out for a dinner or just hangout with friends...it is a great option! One major negative of this place is that the staff is not at all cooperative. You have to directly talk to the manager if you want anything...let it be adjusting the volume of the sound system...asking for additional bowls...anything!! The staff seems totally uninterested in serving the customers. So if you want any special service from the restaurant...talk to the manager.

Shweta Aggarwal,"Rated The Town House Caf is owned by Priyank Sukhija, the owner of many leading restaurants in the capital. It is located in the N Block, right opposite to the LIC Building on the first floor. The entrance is tremendous and doesnt appear like any caf. Town House Caf covers magnanimous space with comfortable furniture and dim-lightening. The background scores were not any specific numbers and the volume was little loud for me. Me and fellow foodies started our food marathon with two flavored Hookahs (Dont remember the names), both were of exquisite designs and felt sweet with every puff. The drinks I sipped were The Classic Sangria, Mojito, and The Seville Town Caipiroska, just ordinary. In food, I had The Mumbai Style French Chat, French fries in Mumbai Bhel style, loved it. The Crispy Thai Vegetables were a perfect blend of sweetness and tanginess. The Chilly Methi Sheekh was soft and liked the texture. Steamed Veg Momos and Green Open Veg Momos were fluffy enough to gulp in one single bite and enjoyed them with Chily sauce. Except these dishes, The Risotto Primavera, The Hummus Pita, and The Sundried Tomato and Feta Tart sampled okay. Being a dessert lover makes me demand more when it comes to sweets but Apple Tart and Brownie with Ice Cream couldnt satisfy my desire, decent but not remarkable. Town House Caf is a perfect place to party with friends and enjoy decent food/ drinks with music but doesn't fit for food lovers. thefoodiefling.blogspot.com",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Preetika Gupta,"Rated The Town House Caf at Connaught Place, Delhi is the sibling of none other than Warehouse Cafe. The outlet is owned by Priyank Sukhija, who currently owns famous restaurants like Fat Ninja, Fork You, Flying Saucer, Warehouse Cafe & many more. The Lounge styled bar has two huge sections one with comfortable sofa setting corridor and the other near the bar with special VIP zones. The caf has amber lightings and is dark. The menu here is extensive from Mediterranean to Indian, Italian and Chinese. This is one of the most happening places in CP during weekends and sometimes even on weekdays. You will find many people standing outside Town house cafe on the high tables. After a couple of drinks, we ordered for Indian food- Kadhai Paneer and Dal Makhni. I enjoyed both of them equally as the preparation was very nice. The service is spot on and the waiters ate very courteous. I love this place to hang out with my friends. One can have a relaxing time over here. chocolateandpistachios.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Aparna Arya,"Rated As a recent convert to gluten-free food, it was hard for me to fathom what if anything will be available for me to eat at lounge's and bars besides the regular steaks and sizzlers or salads. But Town House Cafe not only surprised me but surpassed my expectations. They were the first place in my experience in Delhi NCR, who was aware of what gluten-free actually meant and were positive that they will be able to provide me many options. Additionally the steward serving us went a step further by also warning me away from what on my table I should not consume as it contains gluten. For those of you not aware of what GLUTEN is, it is the name for the protein in grains. All grains contain protein that is theoretically gluten but people with celiac disease and most other gluten allergies only react to the form of gluten found in wheat [including spelt, kamut, triticale and all varieties of wheat like flour (maida), semolina (sooji), broken wheat (dalia), etc.], barley, and rye. So, back to what I did have: The Truffle Oil scented Chicken Veloute: was light and oh so flavourful, I usually do not finish my soup, but here I polished my bowl clean; The Shrimp Cocktail: a cold salad of fresh prawns in a thousand island style dressing - refreshing and yummy; The Mustard Chicken Salad: ordered at the table that I just tasted was a hardy portion of roast chicken with some greens and tomatoes dressed in a light savoury mustard dressing perfect for a summer day lunch; The Chicken Tikka Basil and Olive: although charred to perfection the flavour fusion was not pleasing to my palate, in all honesty I am not a big fan of olives on any given day; The Wild-Mushroom Risotto: was disappointing, the one staple that I judge the culinary excellence of any restaurant by but the taste of cheese was overpowering and the did not have enough of the mushroomy earthiness that you would look for; The Grilled Fish Steak with lemon caper olive: was melt in your mouth gorgeousness and something I would personally order again for sure; The Beef Stroganoff: perfectly cooked buff with parsley rice; and for sweet unfortunately all their sweet offerings were infeasible for me so I indulged in a vanilla ice-cream scoop with a generous drizzle of Bailey's Irish Cream (not my most promising experiment unfortunately) Their bartender was good and made a sublime Green Apple Martini, which is slowly but surely becoming my cocktail of choice. This particular version was more tart than sweet, which is why I absolutely loved it.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The staff is hospitable. The cafe offers a wide range of drinks as well. The crowd here is generally young. I suggest going with a group of family or friends for this experience.

Aditya Basole,"Rated Located in N-block, this is a huge place where you can enjoy as a group and get ample private space as well. The Ambiance: Pub-lit, comfortable, good music with a tinge of class. The Food: The menu gives you a lot of options from different cuisines to order from. This is great to serve a variety of customers but maintaining taste becomes a problem. While I loved most of what was ordered (Truffle Oil, Chicken Veloutte Soup, Shrimp Cocktail Salad, hummus), there was some things that didn't match up to my taste buds (Mumbai Style French Chat). Needs a little bit of work on that front. (Disclaimer: I am biased towards places that have small menus - and make each dish to perfection.) The Drinks: Well-made cocktails, no edges were cut here The Desserts: Their chocolate brownie with ice-cream is a decent way to finish the meal.

Piyush Verma,"Rated A must visit place !!! You can easily locate this outlet in N -block, in the heart of Delhi. It was just a 5 minute walk from Rajiv chowk station gate no. 5 and was just besides Barbeque nation on 1st floor. Don't go by its name. It cannot be referred to as a cafe at all. It's a HUGE outlet of around 8-9000 sq. feet (the word TOWN is undoubtedly the right word to name it ). The overall construction was quite interesting with 2 huge entrance and exit gates located adjacent to each other. Firstly you could see a bar with some tables then you have to either go straight for hookah counter or take right for sofa sittings and small cabins in the corner. Then you would again take up a right to have a look at the refrigerator (for breezers and all) and bakery showing lovely cakes. And with another big seating place you have finally reached up the exit. The ambience was very nice and the best time to visit this place can be the evening time during weekends when the management organise live BAND performances and Sufi nights. Dark colored wooden interiors that matched perfectly with dim lighting and the private cabins which were colored as royal red were serving with good vibes. Their cutlery was way too heavy and we all saluted the waiters how they can just hold it and serve to the customers. Service was quick enough that 2-3 waiters attended our table simultaneously and it was good to see that they were also helping us with serving as it was a big table and it felt uncomfortable to just ask for the dish from another corner. Hookah X on the beach - It was a big sized hookah with different LED lights at the base. The base jar was wooden framed and was resembling with half of the old time sand clock. The hookah pipe was thick in size, creamish color in light brown spots as it has to be in order to manage the smoke from such a hookah. The top portion has gift wraper shaped like that the end of a toffee and it was eye-catchy. Dubai paan - It was an average shaped long hookah with some artificial hangings over the chillam part and the holder was quite handy. Snacks Chicken salad - It was a great start with chicken pieces shaped like fries with cabbages and veggies mixed with mayonnaise and finishing up was done by black olives. Crispy veggies - As the name suggests, wide variety of vegetables like onion, capsicum, cabbage, carrots, potatoes were fried and provided with smooth touch of Schezwan gravy. It was a delight for pure veggies and a bit of attraction for all from the finishing they have done. Mumbai style french fries - Traditional french fries served with a twist. Mixed with minced vegetables and chatpate flavors were providing a flavor that any Mumbai or any stall owner would serve french fries instead of bhel. Murgh malai tikka - Whitish pieces of boneless chicken that was hot enough to describe that it just just got out of tandoor 5 minutes ago. It was very soft and just felt amazing when inside the mouth. Chicken dimsums - It was the dish of the day. Very thin outer layer and whole juicy chicken pieces and probably the BEST pieces of heaven I have ever had. Small Rectangular pieces of chicken mixed with creme and other ingredients that felt amazing. I would have given this outlet 5/5 if I only had those pieces. Sui-mai - It was served in a similar round box as with dimsums. Non-veg pieces in yellow outer layer and veg with green colored layer which was open from the top. Veg pieces were very soft and even you can't pick it up with your fork and knife. It had a really juicy and smooth flavour and that was providing a great competition to the satisfying power of dimsums. Desserts And that was the reason that made me rate 4.5 Apple pie with icecream - It was kind of disappointing and was too dry. It felt like outer layered bread overpowered the flavour from the Apple fillings. A scoop of vanilla ice-cream was on the top of pie which provided much of the sweetness required. Brownie with ice-cream - Two scoops of vanilla ice-cream surrounding the rectangular shaped brownie full of walnuts. For a dessert, it was definitely a better option than pie. And it felt a nice combination of 2 different flavors I.e. vanilla ice-cream and chocolate brownie. Thinking whether you should visit this place or not ?

But on the contrary everything only falls in place if the service is good. Firstly, on a table of 6 people how could you keep just 3 tissues. When I asked for few more, 'thrice' and yelled at the third one for turning a deaf ear to my humble request, did I get some tissues.

We told the staff to lower down the volume of the music a bit but they didn't do the same and told us that a party is going on because of which they can't lower the volume.

As soon as we headed inside we were not entertained by any person to show us or lead us to a table in the sense of courtesy. As we sat down we had to literally ask a server to provide us the menu so that we could order. The order was honey chilly potatoes , tandoori veg platter and baked mushrooms ( i dont know the exact names , i didn't order ) , for drinks we had a watermelon and mint cooler and a chocolate hazelnut shake and a sheesha. The sheesha was really nice and smooth , lasted pretty long. The food was served pretty fast which i obviously liked and the taste was amazing. Chilly potaotes were done perfectly not to crisp , not to soft , had the perfect texture to them. The mushrooms were loaded with cheese and top and the portion size was pretty good. The tandoori platter was the star of the evening for me. The shake was too sweet for me so didn't like it much but the cooler was very refreshing. All in all the experience was good but what took on a toll was the service factor. The service wasn't at par at all , no one has to ask for water glasses to be refilled again or for forks but yes we had to ask them for it again and again , so yeah that was it.",Rated 4.0,18,254,??

I have absolutely no idea what they're upto if not waiting on tables. Apart from the service going down the drain, the place charges 140 rupees only for the water bottle. They dont have tap water. Such a big establishment, they have such cheap money making tactics. Serving water is the least thing anybody provides. They dont even cater to Dineout bookings even if you can see your name on the Booking list infront of you. Maybe its because of the discount. The hookah is 995 including taxes which is over the top.

However, after warehouse this one goes for a toss. Like happened in 2013 , the staff didn't attend there. Here, people were rude & I didn't like it. Not once but 2wice. I had to call the manager. This guy on the front who was at the podium was acting oversmart. He refused to call the manager and i had to say it loud to ask for him and then he went in , he kept arguing and could have sorted it like the manager did. But this is not the only thing. They don't know how to talk to a customer. This is weird and not liked by me. I have never visited warehouse after that neither will i go to this place. Highly disappointed with the service. Also the first time we went there a month ago. The order guy didn't get us complete order. There was nothing provided even after asking for several times. We had to ask someone else and then someone else and we got things when my friend asked will someone serve us or not. No serving spoons no individual plates were provided untill asked atleast 3rice, we asked for water several times no-one served it. I could see more people taking orders then delivering. At that time i thought of ignoring but then if the service is not their you are spoiling someone's days. People don't go out to eat so that they keep asking for things by themselves. Please keep a trained staff or people who know how to talk. Unlike - this was again my birthday which ended with an unnecessary argument. Mr. Owner a request to look into this.",Rated 1.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The dark ambience and the loud relaxing music just makes your strenuous day very relaxing. As we are non- alcoholic, we ordered Honey Chilly Potato and the celery infused mozzarella sticks. The sticks was very cheesy and yum. We ordered Chocolate Hazelnut Shake and Ice Tea also. The ice tea was delicious and the shake was also decent. The staff was also very cooperative with great seating arrangement. Go for it, for its dark ambience and loud music. if loud music is not your cup of tea then avoid this outlet.",Rated 4.0,16,69,??

I really liked what i had here- Alfredo pasta, quesadilla bites, fantasia pizza, town house cheese burgers,mini burgers and chilly garlic noodles. Taste was really balanced. Pasta and mini burgers were so good that we ordered it again. I will really recommend this place and preferably on a weekend nights. Prior booking suggested.

Her Little Cookbook,"Rated Have you ever thought or heard of the cafes interior design based on the church? Creepy? No no no! If the idea of the basilica is used in a smart way and the restaurant is filled only with its details it can look really cool. And this you can experience at The Town House Cafe. The Town House Cafe is located in the outer circle of CP, in N Block. The interior design is majestic but at the same time cosy and comfortable. At the main part of the restaurant you can spot the arches which go from the walls up to the ceiling and creat in this place magical ambience. You can find here 2 bars (1 of them is the longest bar in Delhi), sofas, armchairs, chairs and stools You just gotta pick your place and make yourself comfortable :) There is also a place for the small stage where live artists perform on Bollywood Wednesday nights and live band on Friday nights. The beverage and food menu and specially the letter type on its front covers look like the old books, from the medieval times. First one includes standard alcohols like wines, vodkas, rums but you should try their house specialty. A Green Apple Martini was definitely a thing that made our day. An ice based Jalisco Town Margarita is also a good choice in a hot day. Watermelon Mint Lemonade is also based on ice except that its a mocktail so a good choice if you wanna stick to something non alcoholic. We also tried Basil Ice Tea (refreshing and havent seen it in any other restaurant so far), Fruitilicious smoothie, Mediterranean smoothie and Blood Orange and Cinnamon shake. In the food menu are different kinds of dishes (salads, soups, mains, etc.) and few options in each. So you can choose whatever you have an apetite for and at the same time you dont have to spend hours on reading the card. We started our lunch with the All About Mushrooms soup which was made from the wild mushrooms and was creamy and delicious. After that came a small disappointment. The Mesclun Greens salad was strongly to sour as because of the pickled beetroots and too sour vine vinaigrette. Hopefully after that everything was good. The Grilled Lamb Chops could be softer though the sauce, smashed potatos and vegetables were very nice. We also have to mention Quesadilla which was scrumptious and remaind us of the orginal Mexican one. At the end before leaving we decided to order two sangrias. It was a cheery on the top of the cake. First was the La Rioja Town Sangria made from the red vine with hazelnut and ginger syrup and fizzed with cola. Second one was the White Dove which had a white vine, vodka, star anise, banana and was fizzed with lemonade. We fully enjoyed both of them as the combination of the ingredients made these sangrias tasty, fresh and interesting. herlittlecookbook.com",Rated 4.0,32,199,??

Poonam Chakraborty,"Rated On a lazy Sunday decided to visit this place. Since its still summer we needed thirst quenchers so ordered for Watermelon Cooler. Kaffir lime based mocktail.Followed by LIT.And a Watermelon based Molecular cocktail. The drinks I would recommend both the mocktails - fresh, chilled and flavorful. We ordered for a Non - Veg Tandoori Platter consisting of Murgh malai tikka, Kebaabs, chicken tikka and fish;Chicken and Prawn Dim-sums were fine. Must have is the Grilled Fish - While a lot of stir fry your fish in batter and serve it telling it's grilled , I for the first time and after really long had fish that was actually ""Grilled"". Lightly crisped, perfectly seasoned served with mash and veggies. Stole the show ! In desserts we were recommended to have Tiramisu. And what do I say about it. I do not like tiramisu much because a lot of places have a bitter, over-powering taste of the Coffee. Here, I am glad the chef got it right. Tiramisu must have an essence of the coffee and cream, pastry all should be in sync with it. I got a piece packed for my way back home so I loved every bite of it. I would recommend this to anyone any day. togetherwithgastronomy.blogspot.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Sumit Sawhney,"Rated Once again reminded that huge ambience and huge place does not mean that the food and service will be good. I visited last week on a Tuesday night when they were not much busy. The place is nice and big , huge menu but with my experience that night would not recommend this place for a lot of reasons. First and foremost the server who was assigned to our table i think was new to the restaurant.He did not have a clue what to recommend , what a dish is. He started reading from menu and said "" Sir yeh Quesdilla le loo"" , this is good. Anyways I ordered Sundried tomato and Feta tart & Stir fried chilly paneer. The tart was tasteless , presentation was really poor. The chilly paneer when i ate tasted as if the paneer was from last night left over and just heated and served. Also it was a little cold. Then i ordered the burger platter and before ordering i asked the server what exactly it the burger platter. He said we server 4 small burgers all different. But there were only 3 vegetarian choices so he said that will add one of your choice. Well ok i told him my choice and was expecting 2 same burgers( ultimate veg) and 2 different ( 3 beans burger & a mushroom burger). When he got me the platter he did not mention anything what burgers are they etc. So i enquired because to me all were tasting the same. He said we cannot make the mushroom burger today so he gave me 3 veg ultimate sliders and a 3 beans burger. I told him why did i order a platter - i wanted to taste all the burgers. He did not have any sense of mistake he did on his face. just kept on saying "" Sir cannot be done.I just told him you could have informed this while i was ordering. Also the fries served with the burger were too tiny and really it felt like they do not care about the presentation or the customer who has come for dinner at their establishment. Why open fancy places when you cannot keep a good trained staff. Why ruin someone dinner and that too on his money. Drinks : I had a draught kignfisher. Tasted fine. And also 2 shots of some vodka mix. There was minimalistic amount of vodka in it.",Rated 1.0,50,185,??

Sachin Sahni,"Rated Nowadays, there are loads of new startups are taking place. Among those startups, some of them are blockbuster hits and some are just and average show. You can see these startups almost everywhere in Delhi/NCR but these places are located at the corners of Delhi and being a typical Dilli Waala my first preference is to visit the heart of Delhi and that is, Connaught Place. So, The Town House caf that I am going to review today is actually located in Delhi's Heart! How to reach? Reaching The Town House Caf is quite simple. Take Delhi Metro from anywhere towards Rajiv Chowk Metro Station and once you're there exit towards Gate No. 4 and from there The Town House Caf is just couple of minutes walking distance. If still getting some difficulty to find the restaurant simply ask anyone your way to 'N Block'. As soon as you enter the N Block lane on the top you will find a Black and white Banner saying, ""TOWN HOUSE CAFE"". Quite easy to locate and I am damn sure if you stay in Delhi you must be able to find the place very easily or if not the follow my simple instructions above. :) Ambiance If you would have decided just by the name of the restaurant i.e. ""TOWN HOUSE CAFE"" that it would be a Caf then I am sorry you're incorrect! As just the name of the restaurant says Caf but is really not a caf and instead is a semi fine dine place. Its lush woody interiors, Italy walkaway inspired arches, huge dine-in areas cleverly divided into 4 sections and is spread actually in almost 10,000 sq. feet is actually a delight to watch. The Restaurant has it own lounge section on the right. On the Left they have a fully functional BAR and again a private area at the back of it and just in front of their BAR they have their private RED CUBICALS which really stands out of the interiors and give altogether a very good vibe. The interiors are basically inspired by the gothic setup and that's why a lot of black and red has been used as an integral part of their interiors. You may feel by the description that if you're getting such a huge ambiance then there might be some compromise in the comfort. But, to be very frank there was not even a single second till the time I was at The Town House Caf and I felt restless or uncomfortable. as their sofa's, awesome vibe, great music playlist always been played by their in house DJ or guest DJ's on a special events are simply something that you can watch out even on any normal day. But, The ideal time to visit the restaurant is during Saturday and Sunday nights as they conduct LIVE band and Sufi Nights which is definitely something that you cant afford to miss. So, Let's plan up and if someone else is visiting then please take me again :P Food & Drinks This Restaurant serves a lot of great verities of North Indian, Oriental & Continental Cuisine. To be very true with you this place serves totally amazing and lip smacking food. If you want to have their drinks or the food you may simply blindly can order almost anything that you wish as there wont be a surprise if it tastes so good. Drinks * Watermelon Cooler : A very refreshing mocktail out of the menu and is very fresh n cool as it is supposed to be and you can really taste a lot of watermelon flavor and really is ideal to beat the summer heat and is garnished and muddled up with mint and lemon chunks making it more awesome and a true summer delight to have. * LIIT (Long Island Ice Tea) : This was rather one of my best LIIT that I'd ever had after FREEZE LOUNGE, Rajouri Garden. The Idea is not to compare but to let you know the taste of it. On the scale of 10 if I talk about its alcohol content I would give it 7.5 but is very beautifully balanced and is able to give that proper punch to your senses. * Also want to mention please do not forget to have their molecular cocktails for sure as you may definitely would miss the star of cocktails. There are wide range of special blends that you may select andf choose from according to your mood an your favorite flavor. Food * Non - Veg Tandoori Platter : It was a special order as requested to the management as I wanted to sample all of the varieties of kebabs and tikka's. The platter was made of Tandoori Chicken Tikka, Malai Chicken Tikka, Mutton Kebabs and fish. If I talk about their taste I bet that even if you do not have a space to have that much you would probably be having the whole platter because of its taste and the magical taste of masala and their beautiful tandoori marination. * Grilled Fish : This is actually a must order out of everything that you see on their menu as their Basa Fillet is actually grilled and topped with lemon, butter and caper sauce and is very tender, perfectly cooked and is a true heaven delight and my friend Poonam who is a true Bengali by birth has actually felt the same about it and everyone knows that a Bengali can never be wrong when it comes to judge the flavors of the fish. * Chicken & Prawns Dimsums : Unlike Other dimsums these were one of the best I've ever had. They had a very thin translucent covering from outside as a perfect dimsum should have, if was juicy and tender from inside which was quite unusual that you may find in any normal dimsum. These few thing were some of the highlights that can make you sure that what you're having is best and has a good quality. (which will never be compromised) Dessert * Tiramisu : The best tiramisu that you will ever have would either be at El Posto or else you can find one of the best, Soft, Light and perfect at The Town House Caf. This was one of those things that was specially recommended to me as a dessert and is definitely a must try. I loved their Tiramisu so much that I got it packed as well for my sister. * Brownie with Ice Cream : Brownie was the only thing that was an average but still had a good taste. I agree that I was missing more walnuts to it and the chocolate sauce but if we talk about its taste and softness this was far better than other places as well which I totally agree. Final Verdict Town house is a very nice place to be at, very energetic and awesome crowd, If you ever want to spend your day having fun this would be a very nice place to be at. The main USP of this restaurant is their awesome food with good music and events like Sufi Nights and LIVE Band performing every Saturday and Sunday. I would definitely be back here for sure and would make sure that I quite frequently be here specially for their grilled fish and Tiramisu for sure! One of the must visit restaurant in Delhi/NCR.

Khushboo Jain,"Rated The Town House Cafe! Celebrated my birthday here yesterday. You have a lot of options if you go out at 8:00 in the evening Almost all the pubs are buzzing with energy but when you come at 2:00 pm almost all the places are dead. This was not the case for this cafe and this made me love the place so much more. One of the best places Of CP I've been to. Ambience : We made a reservation for 14 and were seated at a lush and comfortable sofas. Picture this : Good music in the background. Comfortable seating. The right amout of lights. Not too bright and not to dark for it too feel like a dark hole but yet giving you the realisation of sitting in an amazing place. The place is constructed beautifully. And spending an evening with the people you love at such a good place. What more do you want? Food : The food was pretty good compared to Monkey Bar which we tried last time In Cp itsef. We ordered number of servings of House Fantasia Pizza, arabiata and alfredo pasta, veg lasagne. In mocktails we asked the waiter what would he recommend and we went by what he said and weren't disappointed. The staff was good, polite and helping. I am not giving it a 5 just because there was 1. No Dj at the time we went which was kinda expected considering the time but we've seen different places in Rajouri which provide Dj at this time. 2. There was some leakage through the roof which stopped after sometime but nonetheless was irritating a bit while it lasted.

Rohan N,"Rated Definitely make reservations if you are planning to go there on a weekend. We were very lucky to get a table that day. The place is pretty awesome, some really good music with a small dance floor as well. Comfortable seating area where they have booths and high bar stools as well. The food was quite good. The Honey Chilly Potatoes were a delight. So was the Mushroom Galouti. Stir Fried Chilly Chicken was stated as the all time favourite and was deservedly so. Went there for a friend's going away party and the place didnt disappoint. The only blemish - the attendant though kept mixing up our drinks order and on pointing that out didnt seem to apologetic.Still a pretty good place to hangout with friends.",Rated 3.5,151,295,??

Richa Sharma,"Rated I went to The Town House Cafe on Friendship Day with a friend of mine. As soon as we entered, we saw the place brimming with people. It was a busy Sunday afternoon. The cafe is huge and dim lit - just the right kind of ambience for me. We seated ourselves and waited for someone to take our order. After waiting for good 10 minutes, a waitress approached us. She didn't have good knowledge about the menu and was not able to help us much with the choices. Finally we placed our order. The food that was served was bland and cold. Despite our repeated summons, the waitress ignored us. I went straight away to the manager and complained about the poor food and services. He didn't even apologise once and simply asked us to order some other dish in lieu of the one that was served. We were so disappointed that we didn't place an order for the next dish, and paid the bill and left. Except the ambience, this place is pathetic. The waiters are cold and discourteous and the food is quite average and overpriced. Ambience - 3.5/5 Food - 2/5 Service - 1/5 Value for money - 1.5/5",Rated 1.5,12,9,??
Shubham Jain,"Rated A place which can get mixed reviews from the same person. When we entered the place it was quite dark, I had to struggle a lot to read the menu. So, after changing our seats twice we got the right place with appropriate light and comfort. The table had 5-6 sofa seatings and we three somehow managed with that small table. I don't know how 6 people will keep their plates and food if it gets full. But, coming to the good part food tasted nice. Cheese Croquettes were very delicious which were nicely complimented with their jalapeo dip. We also opted for The Town House Burger which was also lip smacking specially the French Fries which thin and crispy. Though Chilli Potatoes got cold very quickly but were flavorsome too. The dumplings of dumpling soup were mouth watering too. So overall Food was great and so was the music which will let you enjoy more and talk little less.",Rated 3.5,3,3,??
Prarthna,"Rated I went to the town house cafe few days back.On entering the restaurant the ambience was fine ,however it was quiet dark. As we sat down, the sofas were very uncomfortable,the tables were very small and we had to bend down to reach for our plates, i was really disappointed with the waiters too, they were fighting and shouting at each other in front of the guests. We ordered herb crusted fish fingers which were delicious however the second dish was a total let down, we ordered prawns chilly garlic, which tasted spoiled and fishy, it seemed as it was an old smelly batch of prawns and not fresh. So we asked for a replacement however that tasted the same too, fermented and yucky. Then we asked for chicken instead of prawns and it had so much salt that it was inedible. So so disappointed , i dont recommend any one to go there.",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

And all we can do for this misunderstanding is that we will provide you table on priority. And no result even after asking every 30 mins. All i get to hear is sir please give me 10 minutes.

When I asked the management their response was that the sofas are pre booked! But to my surprise, I found people who were waiting for table getting Sofa seats. No reservation was done by them. Now regarding the drinks! The attendants are trained to promote the drinks which they have to sell by higher authoroties, like it was BIRA yesterday. I was told that Ultra was out of stock. Attendant was relentlessly promoting BIRA. I also saw in couple of tables Ultra being served. Went with high expectations, but disappointed.",Rated 2.0,16,91,??
Shivam Gulati,"Rated This place is famous in the Connaught Place area and slightly on the expensive side, so happy hours is a preferable way to experience this if one can. All fancy from the looks of it but not upto the mark. We had ordered a mint shisha, a couple of beers and whiskeys, nothing specific to comment on for that. The food was really good, a friend tried the vegetable burger which was served with fries. We also tasted the dumplings and the pasta aribiata and both were really delicious. The decor is really soothing with low lighting and good furnishing. The music was all random, with rock, bollywood, remixes and others, so that was a slight let down. The main concern has to be their slow service, they sometimes didn't even listen standing almost next to us. Just a shisha coal change would take ages after 3-4 reminders, the same followed for the cheque later which got us waiting for half an hour and repeated reminders. This has to be improved upon a lot.

Still Hungry! ;),"Rated Disappointed! That's what I would say... I went there after I won a Facebook Competition they organised. I had won a Pitcher of Beer, but on my arrival there, they told me they do not have a Pitcher so I had to compromise with Three Kingfisher Pints. When it came to ordering food, we ordered ""The Dahi Ke Kabab"". To sheer dissapointment it was not the taste we have been expecting or eating out at all the other places. It was rightly created out of the hung curd, but sweet in taste. Who makes sweet taste Dahi kababs? At least, I have never seen that. Moreover, this had a green cardamom taste. WTH! We confirmed with their Chef that if it was intended or mistaken taste. We had to return it. We asked the chef about his speciality and he referred ""The Soya Kabab"". This was again a dissapointment. It had a strong pungent smell of Mustard oil. As if the marination was done with Mustard oil but not properly cooked or Grilled so as to get rid of the Mustard smell. We had also ordered Chicken Tikka Basil & Olive, which was a little better than anything else. But this bad food, we couldn't even eat that with a good feel.

Arjun Sreekumar,"Rated Had a lunch out here with the better half. Located in N block, the unofficial food junction of CP. It's more of a pub rather than a proper restaurant, therefore the dark lighting and all. We had roasted stuffed mushrooms for appetizers, which was fabulous. Then a classic chicken burger which was quite good. Also we had a paneer curry, I believe it's makhan wala with some roti and naan and which was really and surprisingly good. The drinks menu is quite extensive but the food menu is what is quite packed with a variety of cuisines. You name it, its there. So it was surprising that food from all cuisines turned out to pretty good. Finally, the manager informed is on online payment of the bill which gave us a discount as well. Really really good food, priced as the usual places in CP.

The waiter told us the all the burgers will be chicken, instead they were of chicken, lamb, shrimps and fish. Only the chicken and lamb one were good. The grilled Chicken had really good flavour but was slightly undercooked. The mashed potato was nice. We also ordered the red velvet and it was great. Especially for that price.

Chainita Rawat,"Rated So visited the Town House Cafe yesterday . One of the recently hyped places in Delhi. First impression of this place was good, the ambience was nice if only their staff was more considerate about giving us a proper place to sit. So we had to struggle and move around and wait for a while to get a proper place for us to sit as we were 4friends. After sitting, we waited for around 15minutes for someone to hand over the menu to us. And the water we asked for drinking only reached our table after a long wait of 15-20 mins. Their service was purely pathetic . I mean this is not what one expects from a place which certainly does look impressive ,but once you step in ,you realise how much their hospitality sucks . Anyways as we were already there ,we placed our order for honey chilli potato , veg platter ,beer and their cocktails. The food was good , but only thing being that how can one possibly know what all good they serve ,when these people are just not ready to serve . We literally had to call each server atleast thrice and even then the chances of a thing reaching on your table on time were almost close to zero. What we liked was their long island ice tea that kept us bit cool and patient otherwise the whole experience would have really sucked . This place is not even cheap ,cos we ultimately ended up paying a bill of over 7grands and what we got in the end was cheap hospitality with equally irresponsible staff. I would never visit this place again and this place is highly not recommended . Go to this place only if you are patient enough to call waiters again and again to repeat the same order. Or if you wish to wait for a long time to hunt for a comfortable spot to sit because the servers out there even if they will be hanging around jobless would be of no assistance . My rating for this place - 1.5/5 ( that too because of their ambience and long island ice tea). Wish these people knew how to serve their customers well.",Rated 1.5,102,234,??

Arnav Tandon,Rated actually when i was searching a good place to eat this was never on my list cuz of north indian cuisine but i had made a plan to go to pebble street but as soon as i took the lift this place came first and i was blown away by the ambiance me and my friends immediately decided its not a worry to eat north indian but we ll dine here only. the plush red beamed place is very exotic it sofa are very comfortable . music in the place is amazing the crowd is also good . town house cafe have got a big place with them . the food was great had peri peri chicken and arabian veg platter the dips were sufficient . the cuts of the chicken were real steal it seemed their chef has good skills . the chicken was very soft and very crispy and the best part it was cooked pink which is rare find in cp these days if u know what i mean . the only thing i didnt liked was their waiters constantly gazing with on only women's table just next to me from a distance. the best part am a fan of budweiser and in their menu its not written but a lady mid manger arranged that too for me quite cool . dint had much food cuz it was my birthday night i had already eaten in vault cafe which sucked in lunch. what i felt after coming out was pebble street loosing business cuz of this place ambiance hahahah,Rated 4.5,10,28,??
Navita Gulati,"Rated Townhouse is one of the biggest cafe's in CP. They have sections divided and three entries. Comfortable seating, good ambience, nice music and most of the days of the week they have the special nights figured out. I've been this to place thrice and never came back disappointed. The Chicken Quesdillas, Murg Malai Tikka, Penne Arabiatta Pasta, Margarita Pizza, Dahi ke Kabab are few of the amazing dishes I've tried. Watermelon mocktail is one of the fresh coolers I have had in a while. The place serves Sheesha as well.

Because I found this place nice last time, I took another friend of mine there but service was not at all upto the mark. A waiting of 15 minutes each time I ordered next round of drinks was a big turn off. I seriously should have fought for not paying such hefty service charge for this kind of poor service.

Sajid Vincent Ledger Khan,"Rated Step inside The Town House Cafe and you are bound to be blown away by the sheer size of the place. Add to it the style & swag, the ultra huge bar & decent enough music; the ambiance is set for a nice time ahead. Me & the wife tried The Fried Calamari with Pesto The Non Veg Mezze Platter (shish taouk, mutton sambousek, lamb kofte and another mutton kebab which had a spicy tomato gravy drizzled over it together with pita breads, 4 different dips and salad) along with Wild Sex on the Beach cocktails, the Adam's Punch smoothie & the Homemade Ginger Ale. The wife got the cocktails during the happy hours (so it was 1+1). The smoothie & the ale were good to drink but a tad costly, considering they were non alcoholic drinks. The fried calamari was simply awesome. The portion size was decent too. The non veg mezze platter was wholesome, tasty, huge in portion size but still was not able to justify the high price tag. But we were let down very much by the pathetic service. Such a large place but we could count only 2 servers in our section of the sitting area. Drinks were getting late, tissue papers needed to be requested 4 times and had to shout out to the server to attract his attention after 6 unsuccessful tries! Also the host who was at the main door and guided us to a table (the 1st table was a rickety & shaky one, which we promptly changed) was a sullen and gruff fellow without a hint of cheerfulness or smile on his face.

MeGourmet,"Rated The location of this place adjacent to the likes of Barbecue nation and Pebble Street just makes you revisit this corner of the outer circle. It was extra cold in the lowly lit dim main area, and the seats- unnecessarily huge and apart ,just added to our inconvenience . After repeated ignorance of the staff, we decided to shift to the bar area in the hope of a comfortable table dining experience, which is the foremost requisite for a restaurant! Moving over to the food, we took off with dahi kebabs which were far from crispy but the filling flavoring didn't disappoint. The House fantasia pizza with its sparse toppings was nothing lip smacking. Also tried the Grilled fish with lemon caper olive and it turned out to be this oily piece of meat that would send your cholesterol off to crazy limits. After gathering the courage to try it, it seemed heavy and greasy with its egg sort of batter for the fish. Wish I could eat more of fish but the butter/egg just overwhelmed my taste buds. I felt egg cheese omelette would have been a better bargain. A Total let down for the pricy dish, indeed! The grilled vegetables with Cous Cous was one of the no garlic dish which we decided to try. The fresh veggies finally saved the day! The mocktail (peach punch or something) and the red velvet cake were pretty darn average. The prices are a bit irrelevant and on the higher side (not to forget to mention the waiter charged us 350 for the red velvet as opposed to 275 written on the menu card which obviously, I didn't mention. ) I just really wish I had'nt trusted zomato before landing up in this place!",Rated 2.5,24,172,??

Sangeeta Bahuguna,"Rated Reviewed yet another marvelous out let of Priyank Sukhija at the heart of the City CP at the outer circle with valet parking. Its going to complete a year soon and we were really surprised to see the kind of footfall on a Monday hot afternoon. What draws the customer to an outlet again is the foodgood locationand attentive service and ambiance too plays a big role. Though personally I dont enjoy dim lit places so we moment we chose are table we requested to open the venetian blinds on our left n right windows to let the natural light come in from the large glass windows. But the moment another group of ten middle aged, sat next to our table which was at a distant but requested to close their side of window to our dismay. But to each his own. Interior is rich wooden with very comfy sofas but wish there were cushions too with depth its difficult to sit strait but had other sitting options so no complaints. A huge aprox two hundred cover restaurant with enough space between table to make it convenient for the customers. Chef Ashish Kumar with more then two decades of experience of ITDC and some good brand has really done justice to give a great foodie experience with delicious and exceptionally satisfying delicacies. We started with Raw Papaya salad sweet tangy and Greek salad and fresh n crisp Lettuce, Cucumber, tomatoes, red onion rings tossed in Oregano Olive Oil.was appetizing enough and accompanying with Salad were the refreshing Green Apple martini and The Apple Black Martini with Black current, Apple and lime juice. Had tried some of the starters one better then the other. Chicken Shish Taouk succulent Chicken cubes flavoured with Lebanese spices was mind blowing so was the Mutton Galouti soft and served very nicely. Full marks to the presentation of each and every dish which were a delight. Must have would be hurbed Fish finger with tartare sauce, nice n crisp. Chef`s special was The De Polo Cognac Chicken mince which is marinated overnight and cooked in Cognac Butter Sauce. Again had excellent presebntation with slice of lime which added to the taste many fold- a must have. Lemon Grass Murg tikka and Basil olive Chichen tikka both chicken but very distinctive and perfectly marinated. For main course we had Mushroom Risotto and Fettuchini my favorite and relished to the core. Desserts are all in house and not to miss anyRed Velvet cake a bit more buttery but I liked itChocolate mousse was out of this world really it was firm and never had it so good. Choco Brownie can rarely go wrong with Hot chocolate. Had it without Ice Cream as were full by then. Overall a place for all age group not necessarily for teens. I would rate this place 4.5/ 5 for food.want to give 5/5 though but there is always a room for more!!! Ambience 4/5 wish was bright lit would have been great to actually to see the wood carved roof . Service was prompt not only for us but to others and location is the best now when CP is back in shape !!! Would love to try other stuff also on the menu. Would highly recommend to all good food lovers.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

I must admit it's one of the best drinks I have had.. filled with so much flavours its just one thing I wanted to keep ordering.The sheesha however is little expensive but it's worth the service they provide as they kept taking care of the coal and the flavour without even asking.If anybody wants to try something new then ask for ""Dabang"" sheeshaSo my ratings would beAmbience - 4.5Service - 4Food - 3.5Drinks - 4Sheesha - 4",Rated 4.0,39,147,??

Also we ordered one chocolate shake and banana shake, they tasted really good! The chinese food was not that great but the mughlai food really was a treat to the taste buds!

Their 1+1 options make way for pocket friendly drinks and the food is also quite sumptuous, though the portions are really small vis--vis the price they charge.

Yaduvendra Singh,"Rated TOWNHOUSE CAFE is located on the second floor in N block Connaught Place. This place attracts you with a unique name and beautiful interiors. I like trying new joints and this was all new. There is not a single thing that you will not like about this place. The best part about the menu is that the best is taken from various cuisines. The price was also too fine. We cant clearly judge the services because each of them were fully available for us. Coming to the food, I have been there thrice, just because of the food they offer. Burgers are the one that everyone must try. One item which I would like to suggest to avoid ordering would be their pizza platter. I ordered the Classic Caprese and I really enjoyed it! It was big enough for two people and it was quite good!! The staff was extremely attentive to our need and made us very comfortable, we enjoyed a lot. I highly recommend this place for its ambience, food, hookah and service. All in all it was an awesome experience. I really enjoyed it!!!",Rated 4.0,32,330,??
Jackson Golden,"Rated Update: Finished my main which tasted great (Olive Chicken), but we were asked to wait for my friend's order for more than 30 minutes before they came to tell us the order was never placed. The servers seem to have no idea how to run a lunch service and seem better suited for the nighttime crowd. Pens and pads keep track of orders! If you're confused, come ask the customer instead of staring awkwardly from the bar! Probably won't be coming back despite some cool ideas here. We're about halfway through our lunch on a Thursday and it's been mixed so far! Cool decor, very chic Delhi, but a few of our appetizers arrived icy in the middle- definitely the victims of some rushed microwaving. None of the drinks alcoholic and non alcoholic that we wanted were available, but the mock tails taste nice and aren't too sweet. This music is some of the worst ever though! There's nothing chill about an incredibly loud Who Let the Dogs out Remix that fades into music from the Borat soundtrack.

We had pre- reserved table for 8 adults and 4 kids and manager obliged and offered freeshots for all adults if we arrived by 7:30 pm. Wow that was wonderful welcome anyone could get. Townhouse Caf is big big place and is divided into two parts a) Big group area where couches are there and b) small gang areas with tables and chairs and I believe both the areas are tastefully done. We had ordered Tandoori Veg platter and Tandoori Nonveg platter along with Ajwaini fish Tikka and French fries, Stir Fried Chilli Chicken and Chlli Paneer clubbed with beer pints and Mojitos.

They have ample seating but be sure to make a reservation on weekends as they have good footfall also. The staff is attentive though the lady at the entrance was far from pleasing. Perhaps she was finding it tough to find us a suitable table. The music is spot on and the setting is nice. We ordered : 1) Chilly soya - Spicy. But tasty. The outside was crisp and the inside was tender. Definitely not for everyone. 2) Mushroom galouti - Super soft and melt in the mouth. Could use a bit more punch but you have mint chutney to make up for it. 3) Watermelon and mint cooler - Definitely the thing for the weather. The service was really quick.",Rated 4.0,74,94,??

Staff is not very courteous and we were a little taken aback. The good thing is that happy hours were available even on a Sunday. Food and drinks are standard prices for a Delhi pub. The mezannie platter was boring and should be avoided. Dahi ke kebabs were good and the pizza was brilliantly made. Non-vegetarians liked their dishes as well. Music is a little boring though and does not suit the ambience. Noticed a big screen for sports days. All in all, a decent hangout.",Rated 3.5,60,139,??

Akanksha Srivastava,"Rated It's the perfect place to go with your friends, enjoy a drink, eat some good food and basically have a chilled out time. If you are walking in expecting gourmet to be served and a lad-di-da environment.. turn around and walk away right now! We ordered: 1) Pitcher of Sangria (their house special) - It was very nice. Not too sweet or dry- exactly how i like it. And it was also quite generous for the price we paid. Served us 6 glasses in total (maybe 3-4 for those who drink wine like its a cold drink and fill their glasses to the brim). They obviously served us a decent brand of wine so that was good. 2) Non-veg Club Sandwich - It was okay. Not bad and not dry. But the side-serving of coleslaw was a bit stingy. Came with fries but no dip and they kept a brand new ketchup bottle on our table which refused to open. So overall, could have been better 3) Spaghetti Carbonara - Yum! Perfect amount of sauce, generous amount of bacon and the right amount of black pepper. Loved it! 4) Perri Perri Chicken Pizza - It was thin-crust, stringy cheese, spicy peri-peri chicken and i was a happy child :) Ambiance - a little too dark for me. We sat next to the bar so i got some light. But yes, don't go by the pictures. The place is probably as pretty but you may never find out because of the sheer lack of light. Otherwise, its big, spacious and the seating is very comfortable. Service - great! Everyone was nice and courteous. We went on a Sunday afternoon when most staff at 90% of the eateries are over-worked and cranky with a smile plastered on their faces. But the staff serving us at The Town House Cafe was patient, never kept us waiting, served with a genuine (it was dark, so seemed genuine) smile on their faces and i would give them 5/5 for that. Music - Can be better. Also, toned down a bit. It was a little difficult to converse because of the blasting music! Recommendation - try to ensure private parties get their separate space and the music isn't common. Overall a great experience. Would definitely recommend this one :)",Rated 4.0,1,17,??

Suhail.nath,"Rated Abysmal service..went out with a couple of friends this week and was in for a surprise. Here it goes - food -great ambience - super Location - amazing service - the worst i have ever had..not doing justice to such a great place. As a restaurant if one can't value their customers..then the writing is on the wall. By pulling up one or two guys it won't solve the problem. It is germane to address the root cause, which as per my observation (friends included) was the nonchalant attitude or the general lack of interest in all the staff that were attending. They were quite evidently disinterested and after a certain point i literally felt bad calling out to one of them to help us serve the food as i felt they just despised our presence..to top it all up, when we were leaving the place i had a word with the manager and his alibi was that it's due to the fact that a few of the staff were on leave. But my reading of the situation was the opposite. Wish you guys work on it as i earnestly want such a place to do well..",Rated 1.5,1,2,??

Anviti Shiromany(lady.epicurean),Rated The town house caf. Just a few steps away from the metro station next to barbeque nation and junkyard cafe. It's a nicely done up place with great food. This was my second visit and loved the food and ambience a lot. I simply loved the chilli chicken and fish fingers which was served with tartar sauce. The veggi pizza which was a thin crust pizza was again fabulous on the contrary the non veg pizza wasn't that great. In the veg starters the jalapeo and mozzarella sticks were amazing with cheese oozing out in each bite. The dahi ke kebab were also nice but they were too oily and bland. Coming to the drinks they were very nice and innovative with some being molecular with liquid nitrogen. I would like to specially mention two drinks I loved being wild sex from town house caf and pink mojito. Vodka based but were very refreshing and tasty. The buffet they have is a great value for money. The chilly soya chaap is amazing I haven't had any thing like that earlier. It's a good spread and food quality is also good.,Rated 3.5,74,476,??

Utkarsh Aggarwal,"Rated One of the many cafs at CP, Townhouse is located on the outer circle and is pretty easy to locate. Its a regular restro bar with extremely dim lights (difficult for all selfie lovers to get a good click), is huge so has multiple areas to sit ranging from sofas & low/high chairs to hang out with friends and romantic red couch seats for your date. The dcor is classy with colonial touch & Wooden ceiling and the music is nice & peppy. Their Hookah is just spectacular and the cocktails are Mind Blowing. Certainly one of the best LIIT and Cosmopolitan. The service is quick, despite it always being crowded. We ordered a lot of food but what stood out were the Dahi Kababs - Soft, moist and absolutely spectacular. The pizza and pastas were good too. And all this without burning a hole in your pocket.

Srj,"Rated I have lost the count of my visits to Town house cafe in the past 1 year so it goes without saying that it is one of my favourite places to hangout. If you wanna go for a romantic date then head to the area near the Bar with the whole Pink upholstery and the seating in the corner, if you are with group of friends then the lounge are is perfect, & if it is family get togethers etc then the area at the back with the sofas works really well. The whole wooden flooring, ceiling, decor and the seating look elegant British, and even Irish if I can say that. Menu/food: It is a multi cuisine menu and with lots of options. I have had croquettes here, veg salt & pepper, pita and hummus, paneer tikka, seekh kebab, arabiatta pasta, & the veg cottage cheese steak in pepper mushroom sauce, the paneer shashlik in bbq sauce most often. All the dishes have been good in taste, and if there has been a problem like I have sometimes had with the steak's sauce & the shaslik then the staff/chef have been courteous enough to replace it and make it as per my specification. I have never tried the Indian cuisine here which will look to have next. Service is good mostly but on busy nights it is difficult to get the attention of the staff, & service tends to become slow but that is still fine. Music played is really good which helps to relax and unwind. After Warehouse cafe which was my fav in Cp till a year back, Town house cafe is definitely the most happening place in Cp these days. Kudos to Priyank Sukhija and team again, they really know what diners are looking for. P.s: If you are planning to go on weekends then plan to wait for a parking spot or give your car to the valet without thinking twice.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

If u land up during happy hours you may ne aaying cheers to drinks cheaper than what a glass wd cost at home... Service is quick and courteous !!! Icing on the cake .... Food!!!!

Viral Shah,"Rated The place has potential. But in its current state I wouldn't go back there. The interiors are nice. The food was also descent. However, when we called for reservations, they categorically told us that they don't take reservations on weekends and that if we reached before 9 we would get a table if one is empty. So we ended up going there anyway, and found that most of the tables were empty but we were not given a table because all of them were guess what... RESERVED!. On enquiring they told us you need to make a reservation 2 days in advance. First, this is no Michelin star restaurant so I find that kinna hard to believe. Second, even if that was true they could have told us that on the phone, and we would have respected it. So, now we were stuck standing by the over crowded bar, with the servers pushing past us every 2 mins because there is no designated place for the servers to pick up the drinks from the bar. The music was quite terrible, the usual yo yo honey singh stuff that you expect from any mid end place in Delhi. Finally, after a couple of drinks we gave up and left for Khan market... I am definitely not the only one who has had this experience here.. some other people have written the same thing in their reviews.. so this was not a one of incident for sure.",Rated 2.0,85,320,??

Once inside the cafe seems to be a paradise. The caf has amber lightings but it is still a little dark than usual but the music was soothing. The menu here is extensive from Mediterranean to Indian to Italian to Chinese to even a Sheesha. The drinks are impressive and creative, Watermelon and Mint Lemonade was the best. Go for the Vegetable Indian Platter as it had the goodness of all Indian Tandoori items. The Bhutte Ke Kebab was really delicious.

So no more searching to park the car nearby. Lets come to the restaurant. The ambience is just wow. I fell in love with it at the first sight. They have different types of seating places available among which my fave would be the red couch. Its sort of a open cabin kind of seating which looks so cool. Also, the food is so damn delicious.

Apurv Mehta,"Rated A different concept restaurant let me elaborate Climb on to the first floor an empty reception awaits you because they don't believe in seating people. Overpriced and unwhelming food. Rude, abhorrent service had to remind waiters of my order at least twice sometimes even more. And most were just ignorant of any requests. Most of the time no one was available within eyesight. It doesn't look like they have anything in control,just a bunch of people rambling around not paying attention to the customers. Even getting the menu was an effort in itself. Compared to warehouse cafe which is such a nice comfy place this is quite boring and unappealing.

And after making my point were offered the worst table in house for a couple, in a dark corner at a rear bar all away from the main areas of the lounge. with no ambience. more so the behavior was so uninviting and non chalant, we refused and left, and even telling them that I'll post a review didn't made them make an attempt to make up. first impressions poor stewardship and an unnecessary uppity attitude. place looks great. but a big question mark over its 'class' that it portrays to have which didn't went further than ambience.",Rated 2.0,2,0,??

Shivendra Singh,"Rated The celary infused mozzarella stick and a pint of beer could have been an ideal start for a Friday afternoon, had it not been a cold receptionist, telling us that we will have to do with whatever light the Town House Caf has to offer, when we asked for a space that could be slight more lit. The ambience is undoubtedly great, and on any other day, would have served as a perfect setting. We also understand that the caf must have done that on purpose, to give it a certain theme, but a headlamp or a foot lamp would just serve the purpose for those who would want some light on a day like the one, when we went for lunch. The classic Greek salad was great. But we would have appreciated if the service was offered with slight alacrity. Moreover, we were offered wrong bills and it was only when we insisted on the correct one, the staff budged. We are paying service charge apart from the 12.3% service tax which would eventually go up to 14% percent, once the finance bill is passed. You can argue that the latter would go to the government, but whoever benefits, all we are asking for is a good service. Having said that, I liked the place and am ready to believe that it was one of those days when the entire staff who served us had a bad day.",Rated 3.0,2,5,??

We ordered smirnoff shots and chilly chicken and chilly paneer in starters. And sometimes after we hit up to the main course. The food was totally worth every penny we paid and we were there during the happy hours so it helped our pocket for our alcohol. And we ended it with a giant hookah which made the day .

Rahul Rajeshwar Gupta,"Rated We went there to celebrate a friend's b'day and with very high expectations coz of the hype surrounding the place but everything boiled down quick. The place was packed and initially we were told that there's a waiting but when we ourselves decided to just have a look at the place, there were a whole lot of unreserved tables that were empty! When we pointed out that to the manager he got red faced but we were like whatever, it's okay. Then we started placing our order and with each dish, I again realised that places don't run on their ambience or music, it needs to be supported by something solid like good quality food which this place definitely lacks. The pasta was stale, so was the veg platter but we all were so hungry that by the time we had tried each serving, it was almost over so we didn't point it out. Secondly, the drinks! They are absolutely horrible. Don't even think of trying the townhouse special because it's just a mixture of red bull and some overly sweet syrup. I had to return at least three drinks and after that we just stuck to water. At least one of the manager was good enough to let us celebrate the occasion property by letting us cut our own cake and pour some drinks on our friends head. The staff too is well informed about the dishes but that doesn't help the bland taste. Overall : visit the place only for its ambience and hukkah, maybe alcoholic drinks coz the rest of the variety on offer is worthless and I didn't even mention the astronomical prices for such bad food.",Rated 2.0,46,136,??

Staff- 0.5/5 Slowest service I have ever seen, even ZOMBIE-waiters would be more alert and efficient at working ( irrespective of their own brain-eating hunger pangs). Right from handing the menu to taking the order and then getting the order and the bill. It was as if they lacked enthusiasm to work at all. Ambience- 2/5 Dark and loud music that I literally had to shout to talk. My vocal cords needed a rest for sure. Food- 0/5 Food is one thing that I am not ready to compromise with. Since we wanted something light and quick for eating as most of the time- it was more about catching up than eating. none of the smoothies or shakes were available-THE OWNER/MANAGER/SOCIAL MEDIA or whosoever is in authority of reading zomato reviews of the The Town House Cafe should get my words across to the concerned person- PLEASE MAKE A NOTE OF THIS that everybody doesnt drink alcohol or aerated drinks, so make sure there is something except water is available for them So ordered *honey chilli potatoes- I used to think its the most foolproof and safe dish to order , even an untrained monkey can cook decent honey chilli potatoes but I was in for a surprise. Honey (sugar syrup) was very dominant in flavor- it wasnt even honey as told by this friend I was with (he is one of the top honey exporters of India). *hummus and pita- there is difference between tortilla and pita. Pita that these guys think is pita is actually tortilla-Hummus was undercooked, I could taste the raw UNROASTED sesame seeds in the hummus. The most pathetic hummus that I have had ever tasted that too with tortilla. Lol-it was hummus with pita but there was no pita n hummus didnt taste like hummus. DAFAQ !! Value for money- no clue As it was this friend who paid and I couldnt even have a look at the bill. But I guess it must not be more than 1000bucks. Revisit - A big NO !!

Tushar Saluja,"Rated Although, the overall rating of this place is high. I didnt find anything appealing, inspite the fact, this place being an extension of Warehouse cafe. My experience with this place was really poor. First of all, the staff, here, I feel, was least interested in serving the guests. Secondly, I don't know whether the staff was ill informed or this is the way these people were trained to serve the guests. Began with tandoori veg plater, which they claimed to be enough for 3-4 people to fulfill their hunger. Trust me I dont know why we paid 800(without taxes :D) bucks for a plater, which was not enough for even 2 people. Leaving the taste aside (wouldn't have ordered it if I knew how it would have tasted). Had fruit bull drink. It worsened my experience there. It smelled and tasted like some bubblegum drink. Asked them to get it changed with some other drink, stating the ovious reason. First of all, the server over there gave me a weird look as if I have committed some crime. Anyway, moving ahead. Chilly Garlic Noodles were the savior. Good in taste, but, nothing exceptional. Finally, lets get the bill. The people charged us for 2 extra beers(excluding the 4 we had). When asked, the server said 'you dont remember, you had 6 drinks.' What the hell man? When I was about to lose my temper, the manager of this place comes anyhow and deducts the extra charge.

Priyanka Vermani Batra,"Rated Went to this place on a weekday though a public holiday with some friends and the first impression was wow its so huge. They have good and variety of seating options but that look good only if it is coupled with good service and food. We ordered mini pizzettes , tandoori platter, pasta and pizza with some soft drinks/mocktails. Only thing that we liked was the tandoori platter. rest everything was a disappointment even the sugary mocktails. When we got the arabiatta pasta , it was without vegetables and when we asked that there are no veggies, we were amazed with the response that was that there are vegetables in the pizza. May b they think that we were going to pick the veggies from the pizza and put in the pasta and enjoy the experience of making it on our own .(with sarcasm of course!!!). The worst part was to witness the mismanagement and seeing the manager scolding the waiter. Not seen anywhere esp at such kind of restaurants.

Shikha Kapoor,"Rated Went to this place today with couple of friends, it is situated in N Block 1st Floor. The place in itself is quite huge and offers a combination of couch seating, bar stools and normal seating. The place was quite dead which I guess was due to today being a weekday and tht too Tuesday. There were very few tables occupied. The Bar Menu is quite spread out but only for Hard Drinks, limited options for Soft Drinks. Food menu had a decent spread. Food in itself was not that great, we have had much better food. The quality was disappointing. We ordered Veg Pasta Arabiatta and there were no vegetables in it. Also, the mismanagement was apparent the manager was scolding the team of waiters openly and it was weird to witness such situation.

KAPIL GOYAL,"Rated The new trendy place in already crowded list of pubs in Connaught Place area.. This place has one of the most lavish dcor amongst all the joints nearby.. with seating space of more than 100 this place is huge and caters to the gentry of Delhi.. Menu card is inclusive of almost all the cuisines and bar stocks many good beverages. Food is decent in terms of portion size and taste. Music is amazing and crowd is excellent. Sheesha are a bit expensive but are made nicely.The only downside is service which is less than perfect which is expected from such high end places.. It takes forever to catch attention of waiters and then they take quite much time to fetch the orders..

We ordered Chicken tikka Basil and Olive for appetizers..6 pieces all tender and melted in the mouth. I ordered The Town House Grilled Chicken.

Neha Malude,"Rated It's a pity when an establishment gets rave reviews for its ambience, service, etc., but the owners/managers fail to keep a check on how their staff behaves with customers. A small group of us landed up at Town House day before yesterday wanting to spend an hour or so before our movie. The attendant outside (can't remember his name) told us that the place was full. Those were his exact words. In the 2-3 minutes we stood there, we saw at least 3 groups of people walking out and asked him how it is that the pub is ""full"" when we can see people walking out. He then proceeded to tell us ""There is a cover charge."" And that's when it went to hell. Obviously, we were angry. We asked one question, and got an answer that was totally unrelated. Did he decide based on our appearances that we wouldn't be able to afford the cover charge? Did we not look swish enough for his pub? What was it? We asked him to call his manager so we could speak to him, to which he replied ""Jao upar, khud hi mil lo"". Thankfully, the manager (Mr Ghosh? Can't remember) was courteous enough. I should mention at this point, that the place was E-M-P-T-Y. Not a single soul in sight, except for the band that was tuning up. Anyway, we left the place and as we were walking out, I happened to turn around, only to see the attendant glaring at my friend and muttering something. I went up to him, and asked ""Kya hua? Kya bol rahe ho?"" He replied that he wasn't saying anything to me, which AGAIN, was not the answer I was expecting. Another one of my friends thought the attendant said something to me and he came back, demanding to know what the hell he was saying, to which, the attendant comes out from behind the desk and stands like a hero, legs apart, hands on the waist and says ""Aap kya dekh rahe ho? Humko bhi dekhna ata hai"". By that time, a small crowd had already collected and not wanting to make a scene, I pulled him away, and we left. Needless to say, we won't be going there again. I work in a media house and Town House is actually a client, and I'll be making sure that this incident reaches my editor. I hope the establishment realizes how much this incident will hurt their reputation, and that they understand that their staff is in the hospitality industry, because they seem to have forgotten what hospitality means. If your customers are polite, they deserve respect too, not insult.",Rated 1.0,2,13,??

We ordered tandoori platter and asked the service person how many people would it serve and she replied at first 5-6 then she said 3-4 serves easily. Now when it actually arrived, a single person couldn't be served with that dish. The taste was not good at all. I mean you pay 785(without taxes) and the dish doesn't even serve one person and the taste was also not there, come on is this the way to run a business.

The sofas are comfortable and each table is demarcated from the other by kind of a temporary wall like thing so it appears as if you own a little cubicle in the restaurant which makes any chit chat comfortable and private. So, if you are planning to have a nice conversation with your friends or boyfriend, this place is ideal! Coming to the food, we ordered noodles, some starters and moctails, it tasted good but nothing very unusually special that would crave you to go back to this cafe.

Vishal Dayama,"Rated Decent place. We went to Barbeque Nation first, but due to unavailability of lunch we had to go to Nandos but the same thing happened there. Now we were so pissed that we needed a drink or two to chill. So searched the entire CP and settled for this place. The place is a bit expensive but the ambience is worth it. Staff is supportive since we asked one of the waiters to change our seats twice and the guy appreciated our vague demands. There is a small place outside to smoke cigarettes and special cozy sofa lounges for couples. Overall, a good place.",Rated 4.0,34,88,??

Saurabh Gupta,"Rated I had heard about Town House Cafe from a friend & had been wishing to try it for some time. So given the opportunity, i along with my family went there in the evening as a stop over from our work in CP. The first impression the place gives you is that it is huge. I was pleasantly surprised at the large amount of space they had & separate sections for lounge & bar with very nice seating arrangement. Though we were a bit early at 7 PM yet the place was sparsely occupied. Although people had started coming in when we got up at around 8:30 PM. We didn't eat much & only ordered standard items which very good but nothing great. We ordered a mixture of mocktails and cocktails & all the drinks served were good. I really liked their ""Homemade Ginger Ale"" mocktail. Since they were showing the CWC match on the big screen, the music was not playing so cannot comment on that front. The one bad part about the place was the service. At times there seemed too few attendants for the place & one had to wait to catch someone's eye. However, once you were noticed, the response from staff was prompt & courteous. All in all i would say good ambiance, nice food & drinks & a place to visit with family or friends but they do need to improve their service..",Rated 4.0,17,32,??
Prashant Agrawal,"Rated High rating. Pictures with rustic Western setting. Seems like a cozy place, I thought. I couldn't be more wrong. The visit was terrible. The maitre d' was just a showpiece who almost looked surprised at being expected to take us to the seat. And to top that he had the audacity to walk away on being called by his manager while we were discussing alternative seating options. It took ages and I had to ask someone to take my order. The service was delayed. Everyone seemed to be running around in hurry but if I have to ask for my glass to be filled and when I do it takes more than a minute then you are useless. Funny enough, they serve finger food but don't have finger bowls apparently because they are not ""fine dining"". Food was average. I liked the Dim sum soup. Perhaps the most attractive thing here was THE Menu. You can see a lot of money went to the interior designer. But not to the maintenance. The crowd consisted of ""cool"" youngsters primarily. This place also has hookah and seems to be their selling point. I like repeating mistakes. Going to this place again wouldn't be one of them.",Rated 1.5,67,519,??
Meghna Jha,Rated Loud .. Weird .. Stupid staff .. Food not good at all . Thai wasn't tasting this at all . Cafe was too dark to see friends around . We literally had to shout for the menu into waiters ears to tell what we wanted to order . Took so long to deliver . We reserved table. But when we reached they didn't bother about the booking. so disappointed that left the food just after tasting and clicking out a pic to show . Total disappointment .,Rated 1.5,34,116,??
Shiv,"Rated The funniest thing about this place is the cramped entry, a 4 person lift or steep stairs for almost 6-7 restaurants. They all have podiums below and start marketing to get you to visit them. We decided to try out the townhouse cafe. Interiors were old style (more suited to 80's era than now). The mirror effect was good though. The drinks were all good but I am a foodie so at the end of the day I want to have good grub. This is where Townhouse Disappointed Big Time. For starters we had Hummus & Pita, Chicken Satays and Some Kebabs. All mediocre quality. Then we ordered some Pizzas (Pepperoni & Peri -Peri) to be disappointed again. So we skipped desserts and bid adieu to this place. Not recommended if you are serious about food and not just drinks.",Rated 3.0,87,214,??

Initially we were a bit skeptical about this place but eventually it turned out to be a good decision. All of us being non-vegetarians, we had ordered lamb and feta cheese burger, classic caesar salad (chicken) and strawberry-mint shake for starters, followed by diced chicken in hot bean sauce and egg hakka noodles for the main course. The food was quite upto the mark, with the lamb burger being the most scrumptious of all. I wouldn't say that it was the best lamb burger I have had till date, but yes, it was good enough to compete. Also, the ambience, decor and the sound tracks that were being played were all pleasing. Overall, it was a satisfactory experience and I wouldn't hesitate in visiting this place again to explore more food options.",Rated 3.5,14,160,??

The place was full and the person on gate said that it was not possible to provide us with the table as there were a lot of names before us in the list and either we can wait or leave the place . After talking to him for a while we requested him to atleast allow us to stand at the bar and so that we can order what we wanted . He accepted it and started explaining . that's when a person in casuals came to him . Must around 50's and started shouting at him that there is no place and he simply refused us . He was an ass. The area around bar was empty and we could have easily adjusted . He might be the owner or something . Bloody rude he was .

Aparajita Kumar,"Rated Townhouse was the buzz of the town when it opened and I was dying to check out the place. So one afternoon I decided I couldn't wait any longer and dropped in for lunch! What struck me at the onset was the vastness of the place and how dynamically it had been utilised. Instead of going for a monotonous interior, the place has been divided into different sections with different settings. So you have the bar area, the lounge area, the formal sitting area and so on! Therefore, ambience and the intricate planning score the maximum points! Moving over to food, since we were hungry we straight ordered the main course and we weren't disappointed at all. The chicken steak was the best steak I have had till now. I can still taste it on my palate!! My only lament is that the place is tad bit too pricey and it is something that can be worked upon!",Rated 4.0,6,22,??

The bar menu is decent and offers a variety of drinks , cocktails, etc. Food menu is usual with usual options. The layout of the place is done well. Those separate red velvety cabins gives you personal space to enjoy your evening with your friends . Prices are decent as in happy hours we could have over 2 rounds of beer and vodka for 900 (including taxes ). Last but not the least, the live band was pretty good and kept the evening happening .

Varun Rai,"Rated Worst experience ever. Went after checking the rating on Zomato, however the place failed to deliver. The staff is completely uneducated, in terms of food education. We ordered chicken dimsums, 2 tenderloin steaks, 1 shish taouk, 1 classic chicken burger and a portion of pad thai. The Pad Thai tasted only of tamarind and came with some sort of gravy. Sent that back. The shish taouk was more of a Reshami kebab, not a middle eastern dish for sure. Sent that back. Ordered two tenderloin steaks, one medium - rare and one medium - well done, both came at the same time and to quote the waiter "" I have no clue"" when asked which is which. The patty of the burger was stale! All in all it was a really poor experience.",Rated 1.0,1,114,??

My first experience at this place was average in terms of food quality which you can get anywhere infact better than this place which i was sure about my second visit which was a forced one because of one of my friend's. We ordered a chicken salad which was good, a lamb with feta cheese burger which was very much average even after taking half an hour to prepare it, delhi has much better burgers to serve than what this place serves, egg noodles with chicken in hot garlic sauce was average too. The best part out of eveything was the wrong bill we paid there which we got to know in the evening when sorting our pk bills that we payed for the beer we never had which was funny.on Average food, slow service, bad management in short is something i would like to avoid by not visiting this place again.",Rated 2.0,69,285,??

Chhavi Arora,"Rated Had heard a lot about townhouse cafe and read many good reviews as well. So we decided to have dinner here on valentines day. Because of valentines all the places were highly crowded and so was the townhouse cafe. After waiting for half an hour we got the table. The ambience was nice and clean but it was really dark. The music was awesome. Now coming to food and drinks we ordered cosmopolitan which was ok. For starters we ordered the chicken chimichanga and burger platter. It took more than 45 min to bring food but they served the drinks immediately. If they know that it will take time to bring food then at least they should serve some munchies with the drinks but they didn't. The chicken chimichanga was a wrap with chicken stuffing served with nacho salad, salsa and sour cream. The wrap was little dry, the dips were good and overall it was a good dish. The burger had 2 veg and 2 non veg burgers with coleslaw. The burgers were average nothing great. Later we ordered veg pad Thai noodles. The noodles were very saucy and sweet. After taking 2 to 3 bites we left it. I understand that because of rush the servers can take time to serve food. But we saw that after some time two couples came and they were being looked after like VVIPs. In fact one waiter was continuously serving them and was standing near them only. Whereas others have to call them thrice to ask for even menu also. Overall a decent place will give 0.5 rating more because of the awesome music.",Rated 3.5,83,76,??

Since it was a dry day so we couldn't try cocktails. However, the mocktails were alright. I tried watermelon lemonade and my friend had virgin mojito.watermelon lemonade was ok, not out of the world. Now the food. We ordered chicken quesadilla which was not very much like a quesadilla, too hard and tasted more like chilly chicken roll which you get at Frankie's. Spicy chilly lamb had a strong flavor and smell of egg in it which even got worst when it became cold. So we kind of left it. Best was , when asked for desserts , out of only 5 or 6 options from the menu only 1 was available. The staff was simply not interested in attending guests. In short very lame .

Shanta Bansal,"Rated If its about Warehouse caf or something related to it, it just has to be AWESOMEexactly the feeling I had when I went to townhouse caf (on a friends recommendation) for a birthday party, last Saturday. Foot tapping music - a great blend of Bollywood and Hollywood peppy numbers, welcomed us as we entered this dim lit place with huge sitting area (the neon pink lounger sofa seats that added a tinge of color to this otherwise dark-ish place are worth a mention). Not able to get a proper table for a big group put us off a bit in the start (despite an advance reservation..Sigh!), however the helpful and courteous staff made it up by getting us the table right in the middle of the action. The food was decent - we ordered a mix of vegetarian indian and continental appetisers - dahi ke kebab, pita bread and hummus, paneer tikka to name a few, along with Sheesha and drinks. The service was quick and prompt. But what gave us a totally different high was the super awesome music the DJ played a good mix of hip hop, punjabi, bhangra and all latest numbers that kept our dancing feet moving. Must-go if you are planning a casual, fun and light evening with friends.

I really liked the various sections built inside, catering for all kind of groups. Food was good. We ordered soups, veg starters. Bit on spicy side but were very good on overall taste and quality. For the main course we ordered Pizza, Noodles and Pasta. We had ordered white sauce pasta which was good but I personally felt it bit towards tangy side which did not compliment the white sauce. I liked the thin crust pizza and noodles. All we tried were veg dishes and would surely visit again to try out non-veg dishes. Also it was dry day so could not try out any cocktails. Would definitely recommend to all.",Rated 4.0,8,31,??

Swati Gogia,"Rated Went there on a Saturday afternoon, the place was crowded, almost full. No doubt that the place is fancy with all the music, dim lights and comfortable seating. But nothing extra ordinary, just another cafe. The food was average and over priced. We ordered crispy corn: which were fine, crispy chilly potato: which were okay and tandoori platter: which was not good at all. Even the drinks were just normal, nothing amazing about them as well. The worst part was the service and the unfriendly staff. 15mins after we seated did the waiter brought the menu, that too only after we asked for it. After the order came, no waiter came around even to ask if we needed anything. The waiter came only after we called him twice. Pathetic service!!! A Big no for this place!",Rated 2.5,17,63,??

Love the decor and their red couches just adds to the ambiance of the place. They have a variety of snacks and some of them are lip smacking. The peri peri chicken was a delight.

Vipin Kumar,"Rated On a Republic day Eve, when CP is supposed to be most crowded place on earth, was empty like Kamaal R Khan movie theatre and so is this. I along with my wife planned to go to cp on a lazy sunday and out of Zomatoed out this place instead of Vault Cafe just bcz of the extra ratings. But the people who has seen given it 4.5 and above wud definitely have seen it in a diffrent mood. Ambience has been done nicely but dim lighting is hiding the hardwork done on its interior. We ordered Dahi k Kebab and Soya Chop along with two LIITs. Soya Chop tasted gud except the fact the celt like heated in oven cz of being hard. Presentation was gud though. Dahi k Kebab were presented in form of sizzlers which looked tempting. But inside, there was less dahi and more maida. LIITs have been one of my passion and this place disappointed me big tym. The size and price of glass are surely big...but it was more of an ICE TEA...at the cost of 600 gud bucks. Staff is not sure of their speciality and after gi ing Arjun Rampal expressions (blank caces) said "" Kuch b kar do order, sab waisa he hota hai jaisa baaki jagah"". And after paying bill through cash, he didn't even bother to give me an opportunity to say ""Keep it plz"" Pheww....this place somewhere or the other disappointed me and my appetite was not happy at all by shelling out gud amount for almost nothing. Will surely give it a miss",Rated 2.5,21,47,??

Now to the food, the food is just average according to my standard, even though the menu looks fancy. The steak even though I specified 'Medium' was 'Well done' which made it tough to eat. The cocktails were good. The staff is a little slacky, the people need to know the dishes better. The waiters need to be alert. FYI - The tax is too much.

Rahul Sehgal,Rated The reason for 3 stars lies probably in the fact that I had high or at least good expectations from this place... But that's not to say the place is bad... The ambience of town house is top notch... I sat in one of the red padded semi enclosed seating places and was perfect for my quiet dinner with my girl.... The problems started with the waiting staff.. I guess I came in early around 7pm. so the proper waiting staff was not yet in...and so my order for alcohol had to be changed because the didn't get what I was trying to say in the first time... But the drink they did get was aweosome.... Probably the best mix I had had in a long time... Next came the chicken peri peri.... Again no problems there... Tender and beautifully spicy... Bang on.... So when things were looking up came the really big let down the Ultimate veg burger. .... This was something I would not expect at such a high end place.... I mean if I wanted a tasteless patty b/w two big pieces of bread u would go to Macdonald's... And so we were about to end on a bad note when suddenly came the 15% discount on some particular bank card... And also the happy hours are till late so the booze cost half.... So I am left confused... Great chicken... Bad burger.... Great drinks bad service.... Not amused town house... Not amused at all...,Rated 3.0,70,97,??

Shuchi Sharma,"Rated Visited this place on a Sat evening after booking a table on call. The first disappointment was to see that our name could not be located in the list, anyways we were given a table right at the bar. Now I'm all for bar stool seating but this was two tables 4 seater each right on the bar counter. (Was very disturbing listening to all the orders being shouted out to the bar tender.) Had heard about the food being good here so decided to compromise on the sitting and stayed. The ambiance looks beautiful in the pics, isn't bad in actual too but the lighting is super less. We actually had to read the menu in our phone's flashlight as there was no option to increase the lighting on the table even temporarily! Now coming to the food and drinks, the table had a flier that said 50% off on IMFL before 9 PM. Before placing our drinks order we clarified with the server that did the offer mean 50% off per drink or is it just 1+1. We were told, it's on each individual drink, hence we ordered accordingly. The food was very average. The vegetarian quesadilla bites were made in tandoori style filled with just paneer cubes. At the time of paying the bill, we were charged as per 1+1 rather than the 50% offer, had to talk to 2-3 different people to get it sorted. After making the manager understand that both are different and we were told it would be 50% off, our bill was changed. Overall....A disappointing experience and a big let down :( Will not suggest it to others. Expected better from the people behind Warehouse.",Rated 1.5,1,70,??

The ambience is really brilliant with beautiful decor, soothing music and delicious dishes. The price was also too fine. We cant clearly judge the services because each of them was fully available for us. Coming to the food, . I have been their for thrice, just because of the food they offer. Burgers are the one that everyone must try. Yummy!!!!!!!!!!!! One item which I would like to suggest to avoid ordering would be their pizza platter. I ordered The Classic Caprese and I really enjoyed it! It was big enough for two people and it was quite good!!I really enjoyed the experience in The Town House caf due to its ravishing atmosphere, it also definitely values the money that we spend",Rated 3.0,2,30,??

I tried several veg dishes , desserts and drinks. Soya starter was awesome, Veg Dumpling Soup Vegetable Biryani, Mushroom Galouti,Penne Arrabiata all are really good. pizza was totally blank, It's without any taste .No spices and nothing much, boiled veggies for d toppings, negligible cheese, blank on spices.

Ambience of this place is the best. Old Victorian style interiors, huge area, music that rises with the alcohol intake and an awesome crowd. Its a pure party place and would rate it much higher than most of the others in Delhi because even though it seems crowded and happening, there is a lot of space to move and dance around. Food was on and off actually, but in a party crazy place, I don't think u can expect amazing European and Thai dishes with cutlery. Definitely a place to go in Delhi!",Rated 4.0,28,181,??
Vaibhav Kaushal,"Rated One fine day we decided to hangout at the town house cafe, yay ! It was a fine dining experience with them. Here is my review(drum roll) Place: Fine place, enough space and ambient light making one feel like heaven. Although its a bit dark in the evening. Not suitable for party involving loud Bakar (yes, you read it right). They also have some area shared between the other restaurant on the same floor. Nice spot for group pic ! Service: Highly cooperative and nice staff members. Aura: Well maintained. A bit calmer than expected ;) Food: They have many good cuisines with them most of all with great taste. Pricing: A bit costlier w.r.t to the services provided. Tip: Happy hour will be a good time to taste the restaurant without burning a hole in your pocket !",Rated 3.5,1,53,??

The food was not unacceptable but to me it was below average. Not the kind of food you would expect from place of this repute and area.",Rated 2.5,23,117,??
Mayank Bhatnagar,"Rated The best thing about Town House Cafe is is perfect interior and the second best thing is that they offer Hokkah which is honestly quite difficult to find in Cp. I went on my birthday last year, they offer quite large range of Hokkah which also include fresh fruit Hokkah. I ordered fresh fruit watermelon hokkah which is you can say perfect hokkah, the staff doesn't need to remind of anything from coal to smoke regarding hokkah. But here non-veg item is a big no no, we ordered one Tandoori chicken which was not good and we end up leaving on the table only and the classic chicken burger was also not that good. On the other hand, vegetarian food is good, honey chilly potato and Thai spring roll are best. Nice place only if you wanna enjoy Hokkah and veg food.",Rated 4.0,50,60,??
NIDHI KAPOOR`,Rated So back to connaught place which has become a eating hub with restaurant all around... Sunday evening chilli evening decided to go to town house cafe so got a table booked through dine out for 7.15pm for 3 people. Once I reached up the restaurant was empty and my message said I was on a waiting list.on showing in my message through dine out I was offered a table. The restaurant has a huge seating and spread across. The place is not very well lit I guess that's there concept. So we decided to order kingfisher ultra and an ice tea to start with along with that ordered cheese corguette and murg malai tikka and magarita pizza as no cafe can go wrong with that. The food was decent to taste like any other cafe nothing so extra ordinary. We then decided to order sheesha a simple orange flavour. The service of the restaurant was quiet slow where as there were so many ppl around you. Then we called for the bill and the bill amount was rs 2500/ which I thought was too much as the things we ordered were not too much.

Kanika Goyal,"Rated We were five vegetarian people. And the reason we chose to go here was primarily because of the ample vegetarian options this place offers across multiple cuisines. We ordered Pasta Alfredo in which they were happy to give us extra veggies. Thumbs up for that! Our server suggested Crispy Corn Salt and Pepper and Quesadilla Wraps which were both great. The corn was crunchy and just rightly spiced to accompany our drinks. The wrap had a tangy spicy paneer filling, was topped with melted cheese and accompanied by salad, sour cream and the most delectable salsa. We loved the pasta so much that we ordered a side of garlic bread just to polish off the sauce with. Again a warm thanks to the management since they do not have plain toasted garlic bread on their menu yet they were happy to get that for us. The mojito is perfect. The ambiance is relaxed and classy. I especially love the vast expanse of the place - a welcome break from the dibgy , dark lounges.",Rated 4.5,28,223,??

Swati,"Rated The best thing about the Town house cafe is its perfect ambiance and beautiful decor with soothing lights and music. I went there on Christmas day this year the place was decorated nicely but it was too crowded, none of the sofa's or lounge were available so we had to sit on the high chairs which were not that comfortable but still we managed and hoped to look forward to delicious food. We ordered watermelon and mint cocktail but it was not towards my liking. I also had pizza named Quatrro formaggi but won't recommend it to anyone as it was too bland with just a thin crust and cheese with no vegetables just like a simple margarita, i wished they would have written description of this on the menu or at least the waiter could have guided us. We also ordered grilled chicken steak but unfortunately that was not available so we had Peri peri chicken which was good and better than the cocktail and pizza. I would like to come here again just because of its great ambiance but would think again due to not very good experience in terms of taste of the dishes we ordered.",Rated 3.5,22,17,??

My LIIT just didn't have any taste of an Iced Tea. They claimed to have added 5 white spirits, trust me I didn't feel a thing. On top of which they had Extremely loud music, and their servers refused to lower by even a single decibel. This place needs betterment. Till then I ain't going back.",Rated 3.0,13,134,??

Nidhi Jha,"Rated This was my first time attending a foodies meet which was organised by 'hmm'. Although I could not make it in time due to delhi's traffic jam, however just managed to reach in time for the main course. I really found the ambience of this place among one the best in Delhi. It is one of those few times where I have seen such a huge place with different seating areas. The lighting was quite appropriate and what I liked most was the music which was not too loud and not too light. The Chicken Biryani aroma reached me even before I could see the Biryani vessel. Perfectly seasoned biryani with soft chicken was perhaps a good start. It was later followed by some butter chicken and lachha parantha. The Red cake was quite fresh and soft. In that short span of time, I found the staff quite friendly. The reason I am rating the place 4 is because I am yet to try their starters, and from what I heard from others, I am really looking towards it. In short a good place to have a date or to have a group meeting. This place can put any 5 stars to shame. windearthdine.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Sanju Aneja,"Rated THE TOWN HOUSE CAFE -The place actually justifies its name . It is ""The cafe"" of the town. Located at CP , the heart of the city, it is perfect in terms of ambience, music, food n drinks. The interiors are done beautifully n the area is used well giving ample space to sit.

Priyanka Singh,"Rated ""AWESOME"" would be the one word if i am asked to sum up my experience at THE TOWN HOUSE CAFE , which is there in Connaught Place. I was basically invited by my friend for a get together there and it was my first visit to this place, so was excited also.This place is extremely well done in terms of the interior and decor. The dim lighting and the music playing in the background imparts to the creation of a perfect romantic aura. The whole set up is actually divided into three sections ie. Dining area, having extremely comfortable seating Bar area, for the alcohol lovers Hookah bar, for those who enjoys hookah . We started our lunch with Manchow soup & Dumpling soup. They were quite nicely made. Then we ordered Mustard chicken salad, whose sharp flavour was quite enjoyable. Then came the veg. Fattoush and their in house made Tiger skin bread, extremely soft from inside and tough textured from outside. After that we ordered Crispy Thai Veg. & Mushroom galouti, too good in flavour. Then came Veg & Non Veg. Dimsums, perfectly done and seasoned. In non veg we asked for Pan roasted prawns Chicken tikka basil Chimichanga Chilli chicken dry Thai fish Mutton Galouti. All of them were unbeatable in taste. They all came out really well. In the main course we had Chicken biryani Paneer makhanwala Pasta in arabiatta sauce and white sauce . Lachha paranthas. Fabulously made and served each and every dish. Highly impressed. The staff was quite polite, attentive and the service was also very efficient. There was no point of disappointment at all from any aspect. I was full already so i didn't tasted the dessrts but my friends were praising them too. Red velvet torte and passion fruit mousse were served as dessert. Overall a fantabulous experience to cherish. A must visit is highly recommended to this lovely place, specially if you are in C.P. then no chance of saying NO to this place at all.",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Aditi Kumar,Rated Beautifully constructed structure lwt down by lack of ambient lighting.. The entire restaurant is filled with the smoke of the hukkah even though they allow kids at night.

Vasundhra Gupta,"Rated What better a way to celebrate after your final year exams, than to party at the Town House Cafe with your fellow foodie friends? Not much, not much. The Town House Cafe isn't just food for the belly, it's food for the eyes - the more you explore, the more you unravel. With very tastefully done interiors, and an enormous area to accommodate dozens of people, this makes the prime destination for a few hours' getaway from the CP havoc. Highly impressed! As the HMM! team brought out this event in collaboration with THC, here's all the food talk you've been waiting for: Beverages * Virgin Mojito - 5/5 Why'd I go for a basic drink? Because the best of places lose focus on their basic things in attempt to achieve something fancy. But THC kept this beverage the exact taste it should be - not overly sweet, with a mint dominance. * Townhouse Special Mojito - 5/5 Now this left me stunned, not just because of its beautiful sunset colors, but from the eye-widening taste! Wondering what goodness was added to this amazing drink, it's a MUST HAVE! Lip-smacking good! * Red Bull Mojito - 4/5 An interesting drink, which is extremely sweet, yet refreshing. I won't exactly say it was worth raving over, but if you're a Red Bull addict, this drink's meant for you. Soup * Veg Dumpling Soup - 3.5/5 I'd call this more like comfort food, with chunky vegetables boiled in water, and 2 dumplings to add some substance to the dish. Once my veggies were done, I wasn't too excited about drinking water, which had a strong lingering flavor of mushrooms. Appetizers * Honey Chilly Vegetables - 5/5 I can never get over the way honey works so well on fried vegetables - here being potatoes and cauliflower. With a delectable crunch and bite-sized portions, this less-chilly-more-honey was a thumbs-up dish on the menu. NOTE: Some people weren't too excited by the missing effect of chilly, but I liked it better this way. * Mushroom Galouti - 5/5 The real deal! Soft, loaded on flavors and well-textured, I'd definitely recommend this starter. * Veg Dimsums - 3/5 Too soft! Just wayyy too soft for my liking! The texture of these slithering dimsums can make a vegetarian quite uncomfortable! Salads * Fattoush - 4/5 Now I don't have much experience with fattoush salads but I liked what I had here - with a great concoction of roughly chopped veggies and clear dressing. But salad isn't exactly my personal preference when out for a meal. * Tiger Skin Bread - 4.5/5 A very interesting concept! Beautiful bread that does absolute justice to its name! Meant to be had without using a knife to cut through it, its served with butter, and brings the taste of garlic with a pleasant crunch. Don't miss out on this if you visit the THC! My only complaint was the bread being difficult to tear apart by the time the Chef was done introducing its uniqueness to us, but I guess winter has that effect. I had to head back home before the main course was served, so my experience ended abruptly. The reason I give a 4/5 is because I look forward to trying much more on their menu and hopefully raising the score when I've had my well-rounded meal! Final Verdict Besides well-done food, things such as humble service and our glasses never going empty are what make customers want to return for more. Thanks for having us, Team Town House Cafe. :)",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Anand Vaidyanathan,"Rated Having heard a lot about The Town House Caf , i finally got an opportunity to be here today and have every reason to believe that this place is just worth the hype that surrounds it. A narrow set of stairs leads you to this amazing caf and if it is your first time , then get ready to walk around like alice in wonderland. They have varied seating arrangement which caters to the requirement of a couple , a small group or a relatively large gathering. Honestly speaking , a few words cannot describe the atmosphere of The Town House. They have classy interiors with the lighting being sufficient at most of the areas. The staff ensures that the place remains spotlessly clean by performing their duty time and again so as to provide a hygienic dining environment to their customers. The Town House Caf has a number of mouth watering dishes to offer. For starters, we had fried veggies topped up with honey followed by Dimsums. The dimsums had a very soft covering and extremely juicy filling as compared to the ones which we get outside. The dimsum treat continued with a round of dumpling soup consisting of small veg dumplings in vegetable stock. The menu also had of a member of the galouti family , the mushroom galouti which thankfully didn't have the slightest taste of mushroom and matched with the softness expected from a galouti. We also had tiger skin bread on the table which looked like a tigers skin and is supposed to be broken and shared by all. The much awaited main course consisted of white sauce pasta , pasta arabiatta and Veg Biryani. Both the pastas didn't dissapoint at all and the steamy hot veg. Biryani was a great experience as well. If you're in CP then The Town House Caf should definitely be your call , especially for the ambiance that it provides.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Prashant Singh,"Rated The Town House Cafe is a real cool place to hang out with your friends. We were also here in a large group and had a great time. It is divided in sections. They have a lounge section, a hookah section and the third section is next to the bar with bar tables and high seating. For starters we all had man chow soup, Dumpling Soup, Mustard chicken salad, Fattoush, Tiger skin bread, honey chilly vegetable, mushroom galauti, veg and non veg dimsum, pan roasted Prawns, Chicken tikka basil olive, Chicken Chimichanga, Chilly chicken dry, Thai fish and Mutton Galauti. They all just too good. But the ultimate winners for me were Thai fish in honey chilly sauce, Chicken tikka basil olive and mutton galauti. They are a must try here. Main course comprised of Pasta Arabiatta and Pasta white sauce, Chicken Biryani and paneer makhanwala. Pastas and Biryani were excellent, paneer makhanwala was just okay. In desserts we had Red velvet Torte and passion fruit mouse.",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Hitaishita Virmani,"Rated This place is huge , it has 3 different sections all together .. Adjacent to pebbles street . What I liked most was the way the bar was set up . The 3 different sections are done up differently , one section is just for hukka and the other two are for fine dining . Coming to the food ...food we ordered was done up to perfection , there's not a single thing I can point out that was either missing or overdone in the dishes . Being specific about what we ordered is as follows :- 1. Starters consisted of crispy vegetables which were actually really crispy and were cooked really well , followed by veg dimsums , these dimsums had an added flavour of freshness and crunchiness that most dimsums in other restaurants lack . The dimsum soup (veg) was very simple yet well done . 2. For drinks we ordered a virgin watermelon mojito , one of the few places in Delhi that serve this drink to absolute perfection (it had small chunks of watermelon and mint that added flavour to the drink and fortunately just the right amount of syrup .. Well balanced drink) According to me the highlights were :- The veg mushroom gulauti kebabs that actually sort of melted in the mouth ( great flavour served with a slice of naan , I just wanted more and more of it ) , The second was the mezze platter along with pita bread and hummus ( the different types of dips with so much of flavour and balance is the best I've ever had ) .. The third dish that was a loaf of bread called tiger bread served generously with lots of butter is just perfect for this season , also you could enjoy it with a glass of wine just to make it heavenly . Fourth , their veg biryani is to die for , really delicious served with the most amazing raita makes you want to have more and more , additionally we also had their pastas (arabiatta and white sauce both tasted okayish ) . Coming to the dessert , we ordered red velvet cake , I am not a huge fan of red velvet at all .. But after having their red velvet I am .. They had made the cake really tasty better than any I've ever had . Overall great food and ambience , the only thing that was a little disappointing was the service . So ,if you want to visit an excellent multi cuisine restaurant this is the one . Also , their fattoush salad is the best I've ever had .",Rated 4.5,49,171,??
Tanya Jain,"Rated The Town House Cafe is situated at N Block, 1st Floor Connaught Place and is next to Blues. For those who have been to Warehouse Cafe must know that this is from the same owner.Personally after visiting both the warehouse and the townhouse I would privilege this one over it. Though both these places are pretty similar in concept and design, yet Townhouse is a little more organised and better in taste.Today for me at Townhouse was a different experience because it wasn't a general dining experience. When a certain group of people as enthusiastic about food meet there starts emerging an aroma of ascending appetite.A specially designed menu was prepared by the chef in association with HMM.I sipped in Water Melon and Virgin Mojito which were just finely made. Not to say totally exceptional but yes just decent enough. Amongst the starters I tasted Veg Dumpling Soup which was quite nicely prepared with a little touch of thai-ish flavour. Second I had was Honey Chilli vegetables and veg Dumplings which were pleasing enough. Freshly made and warm enough - the perfect start for the meal.The chef suggested us to try the Tiger Bread with cheese/butter which I must say was really something new and did please me alot. The next we had pita pit with different dips which was just about okaye to me. Nothing exclamatory about it.Mushroom Galouti was a new addition. It was a mushroom cutlet with a base and it tasted real good with chilli sauce.Though I was sort of summed by but then also tasted my much ordered the veg White Sauce Pasta which was just rightly tossed and warmly served. I had quite an amount of it and was totally happy about it.In the end we closed the deal with two desserts - Red velvet Torte and Passion fruit Mousse. These were the perfect cherry on the cake. Mousse was brilliant but red velvet could have been much more fresh.Townhouse was a nice experience and definitely will keep visiting.A very sophisticated decor and comfortable seating to offer, it is a place where one can have a perfect dine and a gala time.Service - 4.5Food - 4.5Ambiance - 4.5Thank You for serving.Will keep visiting.All the Best! underonesownsteam.wordpress.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Divya Arya,"Rated The Town House Caf, a relatively new venture in the heart of Delhi, is owned by the same people as the Warehouse Caf. Hence, youll be guaranteed good food, good service and most importantly, great ambiance. Its a huge place, a perfect meeting spot for friends or even for a date. They have different kinds of seating arrangements too. So if youre out with friends and plan to do hookah, you could settle on the comfortable sofas and if youre out on a date, then they have some romantic spots too. The bar section is huge, so if youre out for a drink, you will love this place. Delhi has become the food capital, with n number of restaurants/cafes opening up all around, but most of them lack what this caf does really well: tasty food. Going out to a caf, I wouldnt expect too much with food, but going to The Town House Caf has changed my thinking. They serve delicious food! So the dishes I tried: Crispy Chilly Veggies: Being a vegetarian, and not liking vegetables too much, thats a tough life. But when you get such tasty veggies, you cant say no. The dish was so fresh. The vegetables were so crispy and nice, although they were on the sweeter side. Veg Dumplings: These dumplings were extremely soft, fresh and tasty. The filling was of cabbage and carrots and they werent oily at all. They were served with a chilly sauce that had a thick texture and a light flavor of lemongrass which gave it that extra punch. It was the right amount of spicy too. Tiger Bread: Now theres a whole lot of history behind this bread. It is a Dutch bread which has a lot of texture and it looks like the skin of a tiger. Its a single loaf which needs to be broken by hand and shared among the family, although these days this concept is rare. The bread was hard from outside and soft from inside. It was freshly baked and had a bit of a buttery taste. Absolutely loved it. Veg Dumpling Soup: This was a kind of a clear soup which contained dumpling, carrot, broccoli and lettuce. It was warm and full of flavours. The vegetable broth was extremely good. Mushroom Galouti: It was extremely soft, and didnt have an overpowering taste of mushroom. It wasnt too oily either. Penne Arrabiata: A tangy yet sweet sauce poured over perfectly boiled pasta with bits of olives. It cant get better. Vegetable Biryani: Long bits of rice, cooked with veggies with a strong fragrance and taste of long. This dish was extremely delicious. And its commendable how a multi cuisine caf can make such good biryani. Red Velvet Cake: Most places use the sweet cream icing for red velvet but this caf has mastered this popular dessert. They use the cream cheese icing and the cake is soft and spongy. Bang on. One of the best red velvet cakes in the city. Passion Fruit Mousse: Its a comparatively light dessert, something you can have to satisfy your sweet craving even if you have a full stomach. Very fruity and citrusy. A refreshing dessert. For drinks I had: Caprioska: Slightly low on alcohol and hence tasted good. It was quite refreshing with a bit of a hidden citrus flavour. Watermelon Mojito: It had small chunks of fresh watermelon, and with every sip I could feel the freshness in my mouth. Its the perfect drink for a hot summer day. Extremely refreshing and not overly sweet unlike at most other places. Overall, this is the place to go to if you're in CP. countlesscravings.wordpress.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Shruti Gopinath,"Rated We went there on the Boxer's Day for my friend's birthday treat. I had heard about Town House for long time and was waiting to try it out. Their special buffet was going on, but we decided to try a la carte. We ordered- Alfredo pasta veg- very creamy sauce and perfectly cooked pasta. Nothing to complain about. House fantasia pizza- grilled vegetables, thin crust and full of flavour. We loved it. Lasagna al verde- vegetable lasagna. It had a good flavour but a little less chees-y than expected. Mint and watermelon lemonade- simple and fresh. The whole experience was really good but since we only tried vegetarian dishes (we had a vegetarian friend with us), I cant comment about other options.

Nabamalika Joardar,"Rated I visited on Christmas, when Townhouse promised 'lavish buffets'. Zilch. Stunned, we chose to order from the A La Carte menu. When you are paying almost 500 bucks for an appetizer, you want the quantity to be at least a decent amount. That was the first of a series of disappointments. We ordered Crispy Honey Chilli Potatoes, Stir-fried Chilly Chicken and the Soya Tikka. Disappointing, every single one of them. For the main course, we ordered a Quattro Formaggi pizza and Vegetable Hakka Noodles. The pizza was heavenly - thin crust and loaded with flavour. The noodles were tasteless. I ordered a Chocolate and Hazelnut shake, which was out of this world. The Dubai Paan sheesha we ordered was fairly good, but I have had better. The service was dismal - at times, we had to wait up to 15 minute for the server to come take our order; although, when he did, he was cordial and cheerful. The ambience is cozy, probably the highest point of the entire experience. I wouldn't return to this place if I had the choice. The biggest mistake I made, I think, is that I expected an experience at par with Warehouse Cafe from this place (The name says, 'The Townhouse Cafe - Warehouse', on the signage). Warehouse is far superlative.",Rated 2.0,17,219,??

Sushant Arora,"Rated 23rd Dec 2014 Townhouse Caf shares the building with Pebble Street and Barbeque Nation and is located on first floor in N-Block, CP. It claims to be longest in bar in city which is its USP. AMBIENCE The place is indeed is quite big in terms of space with different seating for different group sizes. They have also used mirrors on walls at one section due to which area looks bigger. Sofas are comfortable with tables less in height making the experience comfortable. FOOD Nice thing about food is that they have dishes from multiple cuisines including thai, Spanish, Italian and Indian etc which makes the menu interesting. Appetizers Firstly, we ordered the Patatas Bravas, honey chilli potato, the House Fantasy veg pizza, club sandwich and multani paneer tikka. Patata Bravas - This Spanish dish is not available commonly in Delhi. The taste was nice and crispy and must try for those who like potato snacks. Honey Chilli Potato The spicy chili potato was sweetened with honey making it sweeter than honey chilli potato available at other places. Overall, sweet and spicy potato was fine. House Fantasy veg pizza The pizza base was soft with thin crust and taste was nice with cheese and veggies. Club Sandwich This double decker sandwich was nice. Multani Paneer Tikka This was normal paneer tikka with soft chunks of paneer. Main Course Dal Makhani, Mix Veg and patiala kadhai paneer was ordered along with rotis and rice in main course. Dal Makhani and kadhai paneer were quite yummy and tasted best with soft rotis. Mix veg was dark in texture with very little gravy giving it feel of some green leafy vegetable curry like palak. Taste of mix veg was average. Beverages Along with breezers, whiskey and coke, fruitilicious and adams punch smoothies were ordered. Both had a strong taste with average sweetness and bit less thickness making them different from regular smoothies. SERVICE Though the waiters were decent and obedient, service was extremely slow. We had to wait for long time various dishes at different intervals of our meal. Also, they forgot the amount of smoothies ordered resulting in less number served. Overall, this spacious place is nice one for food, booze and hookah with friends when in C.P. but service time is bit disappointing. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 27th Dec 2014 Coincidentally after four days, got the chance to visit this restaurant again as a part foodies meetup organized by online food blog Hmm. The menu was specially designed for the meetup which had amalgamation of veg and non-veg dishes with some interesting names. Beverages Among beverages, I consumed adams punch smoothie and warehouse special mocktail. Adam punch was fine and warehouse was amazing with hint of berries in it. Starters In the starters, mushroom galouti was best vegetarian dish. It was quite soft with less spices and is a must try appetizer. Veg dimsums were also quite soft as compared to the ones available at other places. Veg thai vegetables were another nice dish with assorted veggies. Non-veg dishes like chili chicken dry and pan roasted prawns were also yummy delight. Tiger Bread - One special food item worth mentioning is tiger bread. It is a Dutch bread and is also referred as tijgerbrood/Dutch Crunch. The chef gave a thorough description of its naming and preparation and the dish was served with cheese/butter. As mentioned in my previous review, this place always delights with food items from international cuisine. Main Course I tried chicken biryani and pasta (both arrabiata and white sauce) in the main course. Taste and quality of biryani was nice though it was not the best one. Pasta too had nice quality and was creamy. Desserts Among desserts we had red velvet pastry and passion fruit mousse. The passion fruit mousse was reasonably fine. It was red velvet pastry which was yummier and much softer than restaurants.

MM Chawla,"Rated This is another one of the newer opening in CP, this place has claimed ownership of quite a few people but i believe that it is mainly owned by the same guy who owns out of the box, boom box, and the flying saucer. This place is also huge. It is been designed quite old worldly with arches in the ceiling and dimly lit. The food here is actually better then its counterparts the service however needs to be pulled up. Pricewise the place is quite competitive but for the ambience decor music and food it is well worth it.",Rated 3.5,5,2,??

Aviralkh,"Rated Last i went to warehouse..and now its time for town house by warehouse. The entry style was same as warehouse where a lift takes u ups.. I we enteted there was huge town house interior place. My rating would b Ambience :4/5 Service:3.5/5 Food: 4/5 We ordered x on the beach shessha which was realy nice. Though it was expensive than most of the sheesha i tried. Recommend u to book a table in advance if u are going on weekend and if u upto 4 in no. Then u should definetly go for RED COUCH. That area is really attractive and flashy.:) The attractive green couches, the theme and decoration really gives u a sense of high profile lounge. If u are underage they wont serve u alcohol so decide in advance. Things to order: Being a veggie i ordered roasted mushrooms which tasted exactly same i tried in warehouse so if u wanna avoid that then just do. 2) soya tikka: Well fried soya chunks served with green chutney and onions was a taste changer and was delicious. 3) Cheese quessedilas: it was a kathi kabab type roll stuffed with beans and vegetables and served with mayo sauce. The taste was new and exquisite. U can go for that. The space was huge and well managed. service on the other hand was good. Manager was humble enough to ask about everything and taste and all.

Ankita,"Rated Over-priced. That's the one word I should start with. From food-portions that was quite small in quantity to an ambience that was too hazy and dark to provide a clear picture of what's on the table, I was quite disappointed on picking up such a place for a casual date. Considering that they couldn't provide us seats in the restaurant area, they placed us in the bar area, and then left us there for quite some time to fend for ourselves even without a menu. To be fair, the bar did look good though. With expensive wine and whiskey bottles, it looked like a gentleman's arena. Other than that though, the seating was funny and tacky (no red seats and tables are not non-cheesy). The biggest disappointment was the fish fingers. The salad was not bad.

It indeed its a huge place to be visited with a large group of friends as their sitting area provided various sitting options for a large gathering. The bar menu is exhaustive and so is th food menu with options catering to different palates. The drinks are awesome and so is the food. Our server was very attentive and professional. We really had a good time at this place. However, one thing which seriously needs to be corrected is the attitude of the staff standing at the entrance, specially the managers on the ground floor and at the main door of the restaurant. On seeing a couple entering they never paid any attention to us,one of the servers helped us sitting and looked after us. Being a weekend the place was full and everyone was running around so inorder to ask for anything we literally were shouting. The mangers were pulling out chairs from our table without asking and putting them back without asking during our meal- how rude and unprofessional. Will like to just say this-a customer is a customer whether you are getting a small business from them or a large tip......treat all equally and professionally.",Rated 4.0,102,82,??
Kirti Vijh,"Rated This place feels like manna in a desert.Very seldom you come across a place which is an amalgamation of different genres of restaurants(If thats the word i am looking for).Its a pub in the afternoon and a great place to have lunch/drunch with your gang,becomes a fine dining restaurant by evening where you can be tucked away with your substantial half and have a romantic candle lit dinner and if you want to continue the night with some great music and drinks wait a while and the atmosphere turns into of a night club. The first thing which instantly hits you is the interior of this place,which is done aesthetically.The wood work on the ceiling and the arches just takes your breath away,the lounge sofas and chairs are quite snug,and the low light creates a certain mood which is just inexplicable(however reading the menu would require some sort of night vision). No matter how great the interior looks and however friendly the staff is the focus area of any restaurant remains on the food and it certainly does not disappoint.The food is a delight and so is the chef Anay Mukherjee who has been serving us his own work of 'ART' on a platter owing to his very creative skills of presentation.

Anshu123,"Rated So, this was a time for a b'day party with few of my friends at this premium restaurant. The place is good and ambiance is also good From the mixed menu of Thai, Indian, Lebanese and Continental we tried Lebanese Roasted Stuffed Mushrooms to start our meal with. The wild water mushrooms were stuffed with ricotta, mixed vegetables and a generous portion of cheddar cheese and batter roasted which gave the mushrooms plenty of crunch. The infusion of tarragon added a flavourful aroma while the goat cheese garnish gave it a pungent and tangy taste. While we strongly recommend this one look out for the toothpicks that bind the stuffing in, since they are hard to notice due to the batter coating and size of the mushrooms. Accompanying this was Cuba Libra - dark Rum based drink with hint of Hazelnut, a nice blend of nutty flavour with sweetness of brown sugar and citrusy lime. Overall we had good experience here.

The significant part being there is a tiny world within itself for couples. It was just perfect!!! Coming to the food, I ordered an The Truffle oil scented chicken velout and I must say that it was delectable and excellent!! Then I ordered The Classic Caprese and I really enjoyed it! It was big enough for two people and it was quite good!! Had already prepared my mind to try something out of the box, So we ordered large variety of dishes being The Shish Taouk, The Grilled chicken and sausage Lasagna and The Mortedela wrapped Chicken and we enjoyed it such that ""We couldn't get to sleep because We were full of beans"".

Sandy,"Rated Expectations are bound to be high when you hear that a highly reputed name in the Food industry has opened yet another cafe in Delhi. & these expectations skyrocket when you hear that the name being talked about here is of Priyank Sukhija, the very guy who has blessed Delhi with some of the best joints in the past 2-3 years or so. Out of his 19 eateries, Warehouse cafe and Flying Saucer cafe are two of my all time favorite hangouts in Delhi. With such high expectations, I went to Town House Cafe yesterday alongwith 3 of my friends to check out his latest brainchild, only to feel hugely disappointed by the end of the meet. Just like warehouse cafe, here too, a swanky lift transports you from crowded and unclean corridors of CP to a place which doesn't even remotely looks anyplace Indian. Beautiful wooden arches welcome you to this dark but beautiful place. Like warehouse and flying saucer cafes, THC too has huge seating area and can easily seat around 100 people at a time. Ample seating, soothing music, beautiful designing and dim lighting (tad too dim IMO); no wonder THC has become quite a popular spot for organizing parties now-a-days. There are multiple types of seating @THC. There are high chairs next to bar in one area while there are leather chairs and couches with small round tables in between in another. But the seating that attracted me the most were the 5-6 totally red cubes. They were not only visually stunning but looked super comfy too. Unfortunately despite waiting for 15-20 mins., none of those got vacant and thus we finally decided upon leather couches in the adjoining area. Review till now must have left you pretty confused as to why such low rating when the review till now has been overloaded with praises. The reasons for that begin now- 1. The service - despite the place being half vacant, the servers all looked super busy. Even this much that no water was provided to us despite asking for it twice. They were quick to take the order though and were even quicker to just put the plates on the table and leave without placing them in front of us or hanging around a bit for in case we wanted the food served. Had the place been packed, their behavior could have been somewhat justified but not when it was half empty. Pretty disappointing service for such a high-end place. 2. The food - Menu here is identical to the flying saucer cafe. So much so that even the color combo is the same - dishes name in white, prices in red. Dishes are almost same too with minor changes in the name. Where they decided to differ though was in that one area which needed absolutely no improvement - the TASTE. We ordered the roasted stuffed mushroom, the quattro formaggi pizza, a veg tandoori platter and few mocktails. Not even one of them was of quality/taste that will make you go WOW, which is the least one expects after paying such exorbitant prices. Even the veg platter which has multiple items in it and is generally a sure-shot hit dish in almost every restra around-town, turned out to be a damp squib here. Overall bill came close to 3k which felt too much, mainly because of such lame experience. Infact we later headed to Cha Bar and had some snacks there to satiate our hungry bellyz. Disappointing!! Especially because of such a big and promising name behind it.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Deepakk Gupta,"Rated All i expected from The Town house cafe was a replica of Warehouse cafe but with some obvious change but it turned out to be dull in comparison to what warehouse is, but about the food and liquor, I found it matching the same standards as set by warehouse cafe.

Gurneet Kaur,"Rated Not as 'awesome' as the menu claims the place to be. The only thing I loved was the seating. Ordered the tandoori Platter(not worth the price at all). There were hardly elements on the platter which we enjoyed. Rather my friend threw up post having the platter. Had the Caesar Salad. The lettuce had a weird bittery taste. Asked for a replacement but didn't do much to the taste. The menu mentions a Lavender Cosmo for approx 400 bucks. We asked for two of those. The waiter confirmed if we want with lavender or without it. We said without it and he got us our drinks without saying a word. However, they charged us 685 bucks+ taxes each for the cocktails. No where in the menu it is mentioned that Minus lavender Cosmo is for that menu. Nor did the waiter bother to point out the extra cost. Even after pointing out the mistake, no one was bothered to apologize or do anything about it. The other drinks were fine. The place was empty when we went around 7 in the evening. Very disappointed with this incident. This cafe is expensive and just not worth the price. Do reconsider going here.",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Shambavi Ganju Katoch (What Sam Says About_____?),"Rated For me partying in CP meant going to Q'BA or Rodeo or may be even Knight and White waters. But post the young dynamic restaurateur Mr Priyank Sukhija opened a number of Cafe's across CP the definition of partying in CP has changed. With Boombox cafe, Warehouse Cafe and now the Town house cafe the party scene in CP has gone to the next level. I was in CP recently with friends who wanted to catch up so we decided on trying the Town house cafe, unanimously. As soon as we entered we were blown away by the plush interiors, the chandeliers, loved the green leather seating, even the bright red cubical style seating, the long wooden bar counter, the sheesha counter and the music. Town house cafe seemed like the perfect party destination. I was amazed at the size of this place. Its huge, so so huge that if one wants to hold a party even for a very large gathering from 50-100 people it seemed possible. The very courteous Manager Rajeev Greeted us and ensured that we get the perfect seats in the restaurant and told a couple of service staff to take care of us. How sweet I thought. M friends started with a couple of herbal hooka's and they loved the varied flavours that were available and the pricing was decent too. And when we were handed the menu's, we loved that we had so many options. The menu spoils you with choices and offers such immense options that you love it. Each dish seems to be planned and put on the menu catering to different tastes. The menu has dishes hand picked from the best cuisines across the world and some of the Chef's specialities as well including the much talked about Cognac Chicken. A lot of my foodie friends had gone gaga over the Cognac chicken so I decided to give it a shot too. We ordered a number of mocktails and some amazing dishes from the menu and left satisfied. The whole atmosphere, the music, the ambiance and the very feel of the Town house cafe is spectacular. It lifts your spirits and you relive the child in you who loves to enjoy, party and have fun to the fullest. Coming down to food and drinks, this is what we had. Watermelon Mint lemonade- Tasted great, but when my friend told the server it had a couple of watermelon seeds in it too, he was sweet enough to immediately replace it. The drink was rocking. Rating 4/5 Town house fruit bull - Oh the drink blew me away, loved the red bull flavour in it and the drink was super. My rating 4/5 Lemon Coriander Soup - The clear soup loaded with chicken and veggies was fab, subtle in taste and flavour and a must have here. My rating 3.5/5 Orange Salad- Ah! the flavour of orange in the lettuce salad was fantastic coupled with olives and cherry tomatoes, this salad was one of the best I have had in delhi. My rating 4/5 Cognac Chicken - Now comes the famous Cognac Chicken, and this was the dish of the day for me. Loved the jus on top of the chicken, and the char grilled chicken had an awesome flavor of cognac. The chef gets my 2 thumbs up for this. My rating 4/5 Beverage - What a unique name for a mocktail. The drink had a zing and an extra kick to it and I loved the refreshing taste. My rating 4/5 Virgin Mojito - Was super refreshing. My rating 4/5 Chilli Garlic Prawns - I am a lover of prawns and this dish was served in a very unique way on a cracker. Presentation was super and the taste was killer. I loved em.

Gundip Singh Saluja,"Rated Great place. The ambience is very cozy and vintage at the same time because of the excellent wooden architecture. There are 2 sections - one is got lovely huge leather couches which take you back an era. The other is a little more modern with high chairs and tables, little sections which seem to be really apt for couples. The food is brilliant - nachos and their salsa is to die for. One of the best prawn chillies ive had. Music is super fun - popular charttoppers which you could sing and dance your ass off to! All in all an awesome place to be.

Their ambience is really good , all wooden work with red dim lights (4/5) . We ordered : white pasta non veg: i am not so found of white pasta but this one was really amazing. peri- peri chicken pizza: the pizza was yummm . The crust was soft and crisp at the same time. chicken dimsums : i was not so happy with dimsums not because of their taste but because the skin of dimsums was really really soft and the sauce with it was not so good. They even offer hookah which was really nice and dense . For drinks we had LIT . Service was very very nice and staff was also up to the mark. Over all a vry nice cafe opened by warehouse . I think its better than warehouse . You can even get discount of 15% if you prebook through dineout or if you are a axis bank card holder :)",Rated 3.5,29,220,??

Food is so flavorful my vegetarian friend couldn't stop taking the gravy from my non-veg dish. :P We had a chicken stroganoff which was off the menu but they made it on request. One of the best I've ever had. With a martini which was nicely flavoured and strong enough. The ultimate vegetarian burger with yum sauces and juicy patty.

Saurabh Khetrapal,"Rated I went to this place along with my friends yesterday and it wasn't a great experience at all. Had heard so much about this cafe lounge from my friends that we turned to be there. Firstly, the overall hospitality wasn't good from the time we entered. Considering so many options in the bar menu, we were expecting most of the drinks to be there and most of them were not available. Ambiance is something which was quite decent so would not neglect the fact but food and service is something which everyone looks forward too. There wasn't anything special to eat and we tried all the starters being suggested to us by them like Stir fried chicken, chicken platter, lamb which was not properly cooked as well. We thought of relaxing and enjoying there for couple of hrs which got screwed due to these reasons. Considering we went there over a weekday and had to face all this, really have no clue what would be the experience on the weekends.

Now coming to the food we tried chicken tikka basil nd olive nd Romain lettuce salad with prawns for starters. Tikka was soft and tender on the inside and The salad was just outstanding surprisingly served in a mocktail glass. Then we had the desi Butter chicken and naan for the main course.

Friendaddict,Rated Ambience is similar to warehouse cafe..actually better..different types of seating scattered all over the place..this actually gives privacy to the people which I personally prefer! Chambers with red couches catch one's attention and look quite edgy :) We ordered one veg pizza and one thai veg main course - oriental veggies in chilli soya sauce with noodles. The food was absolutely delicious and came quickly. Disappointing part was the drinks : adam's punch and chocolate hazelnut shake- both were quite below our expectation. Adam's punch was a green apple smoothie which tasted like yoghurt :/ I ended up ordering a coke after taking two sips of it !! Pricing and service was decent. Overall I found the place great...though would next time prefer drinks drinks????????,Rated 4.0,6,2,??
Rohan Mamtani,"Rated Nice ambience with different different seating arrangements. Food is also descent but quantity is on the lower side. Try mumbai masala chaat, really delicious.

If one visits cp often then it's worth visiting atleast once. It does not provide anything new compared to other cafes in the area. The liquor menu is good and provides a lots of choices for bulk orders. The service is good, food is ok and hukka is worth trying, provided u spend more than 1k for it.

Apeksha Ghai,"Rated Town House Cafe is situated near the statesman building. It is in line with a lot of restaurants. Situated on the first floor, you have to use the elevators' to reach the cafe. The elevators directly open in the cafe and has a certain dimlighting. It takes a while to adjust to the diminished lighting,giving it a classy bar cafe feel. The food served here leaves your taste buds craving for more. The quantity and quality of the food is very good. I went with a friend and we ordered tandoori chicken and nonveg mini burgers. The chicken was lip smackling good and mini burgers were quite satisfying. The waiters were quick and the service was overall very good. A place with an exorbitant drinking and eating menu.

As soon as I saw the menu, I was highly pleased. There were too many options that it cannot be tried one one single visit. Was pretty happy to see the amount of vegetarian options too. The food was good taste wise. Qty was not as per the value for money but good taste made up for it. The staff was like warehouse.. Too busy to attend but attended nicely when they did.

Rahul Singh,"Rated The Town House Caf, one of the latest additions to the caf space in Delhi and will definitely a rate it as a worthy one. After a lot of discussion finally decided to visit this place on a Saturday evening with some friends and was amazed the moment we stepped into this huge caf. Looking at the ambience your feel like you have gone back to the Victorian era with beautiful couches, amazing walls and night lighting. Talking about the food, the best part about this place is their happy hour deals and their huge hookahs. One of the dishes worth trying here is the mini burger platter which seems like an interesting addition.",Rated 4.0,87,581,??

First of all .. this is a huge place... lots of seating hidden away... nice decor of an old city/town house with bottle green upholstered furniture... really great so see such a place...

Asmita Singh,"Rated As you're taken up the lift, you land into a rather dark setting. What you'll see is well, pretty less and it's going to take time to get used to the rather dingy lighting. But as you walk in, you're guided into a long space because of the mirrors on one wall, you'll notice beautiful wooden arches put together to form a vault with these candlelights, giving you the feel of a real town house. The place is divided into three sections. One of them has the comfortable low sofas accompanied with the wood work, the other has high chairs next to the well lit bar and yet another has a dash of red in the front facing sofa arrangement. This place does leave an impression with it's interiors. Coming to the food, they've got some really fun items on the menu. The grilled chicken and sausage lasagne was well prepared and totally filling. The drinks accompanied did well too!

Since we got there a little early, we had enough options to choose our table and spent 3 hours over there! Totally worth it! We friends had couple of beers, lemonades, and soft drinks! In appetizers we had : chicken satay with peanut sauce! No complains at all! It was the way i wanted it to be! Chicken quesadilla was good in taste too! The next pick was mini burgers platter ( chicken) which was definitely a smart pick! The mini burgers were just as good as a big burger would have been! Chicken mezze platter was huge! It had a great spread of lamb and chicken ! Served with 4 dips, the whole platter was the 'dish' of the day! The crisp added to the vibrant ambiance of the place pushes my inner foodie to go to this place again, soon and try something from the mains too! However some of the service guys have little/ no knowledge about whats in the menu And infact some of them lacked the basic courtesy! You gotta watch out for this case! Else, a perfect place for enjoying! Its definitely a reco from my side! A 4/5 for this one!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Archie Jain,"Rated I visited this place day before, being monday it was sparsely crowded. I was accompanied by my two other friends and went with a mood for some drink as we needed to quench our thirst. They have limited options in the mocktails, we tried watermelon and mint lemonade; that might not be the exact name as mentioned on the menu but it was listed as the last drink in mocktails section and also ordered peach iced tea. Both the drinks were above my expectations and satiated my taste buds. Along with this we ordered greek salad which was not upto my expectations but was not so bad either. We had a look at the vast menu they serve and it is pretty impressive. In a nutshell, inspite of the fact that this place is a little expensive it is worth visiting once. The ambience and drinks are excellent, service and food is good and I will visit this place soon.",Rated 3.5,10,47,??

Quantity was a bit of an issue but not too much, bu tthe quality was just fine. And for beverages we had coke and a Basil Iced Tea which was fresh and full of flavours,.

Mayank Shah,"Rated If you are a foodie and like indulging, walk right through. This place is great and you are in for a treat! The non- veg starters in the buffet were all brilliant. The chicken and mutton sheekh kabab were exceptional and so was the prawn dish served in starters. The range of food offered here never disappoints the foodie, who has something or the other delicious to choose from in each section: salads, starters, main course and desserts! However, I should warn that the veg barbecue had an overwhelming masala flavour, which I found to be extremely unpleasant. Also, the non-veg was soo tasty that veg dishes really did not appear appealing. Something that is remarkable about this place is the service, and the staff! Very cordial and welcoming, your whole experience is enhanced by the warm setting and staff. On the whole, it was a delightful experience.",Rated 3.5,13,56,??

Kanupriya Singh,"Rated An unplanned lunch outing brought us to this place in Connaught Place outer circle. And the first thing that strikes you upon entering the place is its opulence. With the interior done almost entirely in dark colors like brown, mahogany and bottle green and dim lighting, the place gives the feeling of late evening / night even in day. There is plenty of space and options to sit. Today, the place was apparently hosting a number of kitty/birthday parties. So the staff's attention was totally focused on them, much to the chagrin of other guests like us, who were made to wait endlessly. And that is my only grudge with the place. We had placed a simple order of Town House Special Grilled Chicken and the Mini Pizzlette Platter, but it took us forever to - first, place the order; second, get the order and third, to pay the bill! It was supremely frustrating. The food was good, which made up for some of the waiting. The chicken was tender and tasty (served with pita bread, hummus and stir-fried veggies), and all the six types of pizza (3 veg, 3 non-veg) were well made. As always happens with me, I liked the veg pizzas more than the non-veg ones. Taste - 4/5 Ambiance - 4/5 Service - 2/5",Rated 3.0,60,139,??

Gaurav Prakash,"Rated I had heard a lot about this place and a couple of my friends had been to this cafe before.I had heard only good things and that this cafe being a sister concern of the Warehouse, it has to be good, I thought. But but but.. I was about to be proven wrong when i decided to pay the much hyped ""Town House Cafe"" a visit with two of my friends. We had trouble locating this place since it's placed among a lot of cafes but that's okay. We took the stairs since we din know that there was an elevator too. Reached the place and there was nobody to assist us with a place to sit. Like nobody. I really felt as if I was in ELF, Hauz Khas again. I went around and caught hold of a crew member who was too busy {yes. Super busy]to help us out in settling down and sit somewhere. We stood for 10 minutes. And even when the guy showed us a seat , there was massive confusion. I took a round of the cafe in the meanwhile and it is really huge. Alright. So, we were sitting now. My friend and his girlfriend on single seater couches and i was given a chair (to accommodate 3 people in a place of 2) , even when i saw booths which were vacant and which were in same condition even after 2-2.5 hours. Another ten minutes and a crew member comes to take the order only to realise that we haven't been given a menu. Beat that, 15 minutes into the place where I'm going to burn 2.5 k , i don't have the menu The nice guy gives us the menu and we order The veg fantasia pizza, a hookah(some new flavor, costs a whopping 995/- without taxes), Two 7 ups, one cold coffee,The potato bravas. This place is such a negative experience. The guy served pizza before the potato bravas. No problem. So, the crew member was in so much hurry that he did not even have the time to place the plates in front of us. He just kept it there stacked and rushed. When i asked for seasoning, he said they don't have it. Probably because he did not understand it. My friend asked for oregano and chilli flakes and he said he ll get it. Imagine! Yes! We had to struggle for the ketchup and mustard sauce and by this time, i literally was cursing myself for coming to this god damn cafe. The pizza was okayish. Nothing great about it at all. Potato bravas was good but the quantity was too less. The hookah was decent. Nothing great about it. So, all this busyness of the crew was because there was a party going on! Yeah.Right! A private party in a cafe. Haha! When i asked the crew member to make me talk to a manager, he sent another crew member instead. He wasn't even willing to listen to me. I had gone to the Hard Rock cafe the same afternoon and i saw two sides of the cafe industry, Quick Tip : Try treating each customer with care and attention. Call yourself a banquet hall and not a cafe if you intend to host parties at the expense of other patrons' experience. This is good money we are spending here. Also, the cold coffee was pathetic.

Rohit Dassani (www.RohitDassani.com),"Rated The Town House Caf at Connaught Place, Delhi opened in June this year and is themed after the Warehouse Cafe. The outlet is owned by none other than Priyank Sukhija, who currently has more than 19 restaurants across the city. The group owns famous restaurants like Fat Ninja, Fork You, Flying Saucer, Skooter and so many more. It might be a little difficult to find this cafe but its just opposite to the LIC building on the outer circle of Connaught Place. The caf is on the 1st floor and once inside the ambiance would amaze you. The Lounge styled bar has two huge sections one with comfortable sofa setting corridor and the other near the bar with special VIP zones. We sat infront of the bar in comfortable cabin styled seating. The caf has amber lightings but it is still a little dark than usual but the music was soothing. The menu here is extensive from Mediterranean to Indian to Italian to Chinese to even a Sheesha. The range of food would never disappoint you. We started off with The Salad which had Lettuce along with cheese dumpling toasted with Balsamic reduction. The salad was outstanding and the bitterness of the Balsamic reduction was taken care of by the Chef in this amazing concept. We then moved to the Vegetable Indian Platter which had Dahi Ke Kebab, Bhutte Ke Kebab, Multani Panner Tikka, Chilli Methi Seekh and Soya Tikka served with Spicy masala Onions. The Dahi Ke Kebab were soft and succulent and had an after taste of exotic Indian spices. So were the Bhutte Ke Kebab. A must try here! The Panner Tikka was also good but failed to impress infront of the Chilli Methi Seekh. Not much chilli as the name suggests but succulent again. The Soya Tikka was tender and delicious. The Town House Caf has a huge range of both Cocktails and Mocktails. We also order a couple of drinks including the Watermelon and Mint Lemonade and Red Lemonade in Mocktails. And Caprioska Ginger and Blood Orange and Mojito with Basil and Clove in Cocktails. The Mocktails were extraordinary especially the Watermelon and Mint Lemonade. The Mojito with Basil and Clove was just breathtaking and I have never seen such a drink with clove infusion. Hats off. The mixed Vegetable Pizza Platter gave us the option to try more than one authentic Italian Pizza. The thin crust Pizza had tangy tomato sauce and a generous amount of Cheese was put in. The slices were divided into each topping including mushroom, broccoli, baby corn and red pepper with Orange. The Pizza was baked till perfection and topped with fresh basil leaves. The Crispy corn with Salt and Pepper was another favorite. The corns were deep fried and then tossed with spring onions. The presentation of the dish was fabulous. The corns were served in a basket made out of poppudums and served on fried noodles. The corns were served along with Red Chili Sauce. For desserts we had Hot Brownie with Ice-cream. The brownie was fresh and dripping with chocolate sauce. The brownie was served with 2 ice-creams, Vanilla and Chocolate. Both the ice-creams are made in the house and went really well with the Brownie. The brownie had large chunks of peanuts to give it a nutty taste. A must have! The service was great and the waiters knew exactly what was being served. With more than 2 decades of global culinary experience it was my pleasure to be eating the food made by Chef Anay Mukherjee. He brings dishes from around the world on the plates of The Town House Caf. On the Chefs recommendation we also had the Green tea. The Green Tea helped us walk after such a heavy packing! The Verdict:- Food/Taste - 9/10 Service - 9/10 Value for Money - 9/10 Ambiance - 9/10 (minus one for lights) Quantity - 9/10 Amazing ambiance and food! rohitdassani.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Bhavika Malhotra,"Rated After hearing amazing things about The Town House Cafe, we finally decided to try this place out and we are not disappointed even a wee bit. You enter the place and the first thing you notice is the huge space. Spread over a large area, there are various dining areas separated from each other with different seating arrangements available ( read: couches, high chairs, normal low ones). This cafe is perfect for you if you like good music playing, great ambience, don't mind dim lights and want good food. We had dahi ke kabab which I was trying for the first time and simply loved. Since it was my first time tasting Dahi ke kebab, I don't have any place to compare it with. Maybe there are places that cook it better but this one was pretty good too. Honey Chilly Potato was pretty fine too, just a tad bit spicy for my liking. Have had better. We ordered Ginger ale and some watermelon drink and I really liked the watermelon drink. The house fantasia pizza was a 4/5 too. All in all, a good place with good music and good food. Can be visited again and again.",Rated 4.5,2,28,??
Nitin Bansal,"Rated This is one of the place which deserves a 5 star rating for the ambience. Although when you are on the gate of it, the entrance is not that good. You might just ignore it and walk away. But once you enter the place, you will find it every bit of your money spent, just for the ambience. We ordered some smoothies and crisp corn and chilly chicken and they were good. The hookah was a bit costly (starts from 1000 bucks + taxes) but rest was ok.

But at the first glance while going up the stairs it did not give a good feel..once we entered.. it was a huge place with some low sitting and very dim light..so we decided not to sit here but in there other section... As the restaurant was not full..it took the waiter almost 20 min before we called him and asked if possible plz take the order...it was my mistake that I asked the server what is this"" molecular gastronomy drinks""..it took them almost 10 min asking every person from bartender to the manager to know what are those THINGS in there so called menu and even at last they were not able to explain what's it... instead I got an answer""its just written in the menu but does not mean anything""i was quite surprised.. But thought let it go... Then I asked the server about some continental dishes in prawns but they said its not available but he can ask the chef to prepare..but my bad luck still followed and I got Chinese dish Instead of a continental one..and when i told I can't have Chinese dish it was replied its a conti dish with bell pepper and some spices.. I forced to call the chef who was generous enough to change the dish for us.. Even we asked for a chicken veloute soup which was again not available.. I mean no prawns and no soup how they are running the damm show.. And then we ordered beer which was chilled ..virgin mojito which was flat and Peri Peri chicken PIZZA WHICH WAS OKOK...

Chitwan Prabhakar,"Rated The staircase to this place on first floor of N block, outer circle, CP would give you an impression that it is some regular and tiny place. However, the enormous sitting spread and separated dining areas inside would just confuse you to the extent that you may think some other restaurant conjoints the space. The interiors are rather dark and lit with neon and jazzy lit red lamps and wall units. One really needs to take a walk around before he should finalise where to sit. The reason I mention that is because the staff is in scarcity and they won't reach you quick enough to even offer water. Upon waving and asking every passing by staff, we got someone to give water and the menu. What kept us going was the awesome music which made us realize that this place is suitable for evenings and not for lunch. But then cafs are fit for both, aren't they? We ordered chilly paneer, penny arabiatta in mixed sauce and margarita pizza. The chilly paneer and pasta good indeed but the pizza didn't really get us kicking. We ordered sheesha as well but should have checked the price first.. Also happy hours on IMFL only wasn't a turn on either. We ended up shelling close to 2k each for food that we enjoyed to some extent and a pint each and overprized sheesha. Probably I could have rated it better if it wasn't for lunch that I was looking for. I may not go again, considering that there are a zillion options around.",Rated 3.0,28,178,??

Devdeep Majumdar,"Rated The Town House Cafe has a diverse set of seating arrangements. From bar stools, to comfortable couches, to semi-private cubicles and high-backed quasi-vintage chairs. Needless to mention that the place itself is pretty big and nicely decked up. When we reached, we were told by the concierge on the ground floor that we might not find a free table and the place is full, but were free to go check- and we did. There were a good number of free tables, and to this day I wonder why he lied to us. Hmmm Anyway, I dont usually get deterred by deceitful doormen, and I grew somewhat fond of the place in the short time we spend on a quick dinner. Food: The food here is good. I ordered an Italian Steak Melt Burger and received a decent sized juicy burger with fries and coleslaw. The meat was a little too hard for my taste, but I kind of enjoyed the tough leathery slice of beef in between the bun. My wife ordered a Chicken Lasagna (which I dont know why I couldnt find in the menu) that was delicious. Ambience: Most areas in this caf are a little dark, but I think it goes well with the rest of the ambience and music. They have these cool artificial candles that add some light to the table, but not enough to identify whats on your plate. The hookah generated smoky atmosphere seems to complement the blaring lounge electronica thats played by an in house DJ Service: Service is a little slow, but the waiters are patient and courteous. Overall: The Town House Caf is a nice place to chill, but not really worthy of being a must-visit. Everything about it was normally normal. Ordinary stuff with no hiccups.",Rated 3.5,31,111,??

Not bad but nothing to rave about. Their Veg Stir Fried noodles, Quesadilla Bites, Raw Papaya Salad are a must-try. It is one of the only places that actually know how to make a decent hookah. The flavor doesn't burn out too quickly, the smoke comes easily without having to pull too hard and ash doesn't choke the pipe.

Restaurants are more about concepts and no compromises on the food. I was disappointed with the visit. first we were seated at a table which was not cleaned post the last visit, after repeated requests the table was cleaned. we were served the menu but no water. We ordered three smoothies, hazelnut chocolate and a watermelon smoothie, watermelon smoothie they didn't have but was on the menu. however it happens and i replaced it with a Med classic smoothie, Dubai Paan sheesha and lamb burger, per peri chicken pizza and the mezze platter. smoothies were a disappointment, the sheesha came 50 minutes late, though the place was low on its capacity, smoothies came in post the pizza, though pizza and burger had to be served together. burger came at the last and we were nearly done. i might only want to go back for the decor, but thats not going to sustain for long. please help your servers to serve it RIGHT :) good luck",Rated 2.5,4,47,??
Anushree Jairath,"Rated Had heard a lot about this place, thanks to zomato and a couple of friends. Full marks to the place for the ambience. The place is enormous with various seating options like sofas, bar chairs and couches. Such a huge place makes it difficult to decide where to sit. We went around 6.30 pm on a weekday and we were the first one to enter the place. So, thankfully we missed the crowd. 5/5 for the ambience though. The problem with this place is that food is average and not something to rave about. We ordered honey chilli potato, paneer panini, the ultimate veg burger and penne with arrabita sauce (everything vegetarian). Chilli potato and the panini were quite good. But the veg burger was terrible and the pasta was average. For the price, one definitely feels slightly disappointed with the food, and hence the 3.5 ratings. We ended up paying 2700 (for four people including three alcoholic beverages) which is slightly steep considering that the food was not great. The service is average too. Everyone is clearly going here because of the hype and because it's the new-place-in-town but it's alright to chill with friends, catch up and have a couple of drinks (cause they have happy hours on drinks till 9.30 pm which is great) but don't expect the food to be anything out of the world.

The food is excellent, the shish taouk n the mezze platter were amazing but the cocktails served were disappointing, had to ask the server to spike em with more alcohol each time.

Riti Gupta,Rated We were looking for a restaurant in N block after having coffee at Starbucks. While going though the menu outside the restaurant we noticed the owner is same as warehouse cafe. Having previously nice experience at warehouse cafe we decided to venture this place. This place has recently opened recently in August itself. Being a Saturday it was little crowded but we managed to get the seats without having to wait. AMBIANCE : The ambiance was spectacular. It is a very huge place with dim lighting and wooden decor. FOOD : I ordered peach iced tea and crispy stuffed mushroom for starters and veg club sandwich for main course. Peach iced tea was bland and did not have the right consistency. Veg club sandwich was great with plenty of cheese and vegetables but still I was not able to finish it as it included four sandwiches so packed some for home. Roasted stuffed mushroom was well done with loads of cheese inside it and tasted yummy with mayonnaise. The cafe is slightly overpriced but food is served in good quantity which makes up for it. The place is well managed. I would really recommend the place.,Rated 4.0,5,104,??

Personally the place would never ever look crowded even if it is full. Now this place is priced good for the ambience and the quality they offer - Nothing you wouldn't have had before. We ordered for one mocktail, 2 LIITs, 1 Mojito, one Cosmo, a starter and one main course - and spent only 4k on it. The menu is spread across Veg and Non Veg with options from Asian and Continental and all standard dishes are available.

Bharat Sharma,"Rated We found ourselves wandering around again and as we were walking by, I remembered reading about this place on Zomato. The place was crowded but the friendly manager said it would be 10 minutes, or less. We waited about 5 min and he sat us inside. I can't really say enough about this place. It's intimate, charming and the food is top-notch. The service is also fantastic and although there's always been a wait i've been impressed with how quickly they get you in even with a crowd. The place is located in N block Outer circle on 1st floor. It's pretty cozy and gets pretty loud, but with all the wood and decor, noise didn't reverberate at all. The tables for two are big enough. The wait staff is very friendly and work very hard together. The menu has lots of options, but the items I've tried are all delicious: While we were looking at the menu, we decided to each order a beer. It was chilled. We also ordered two sheesha. We split two of the pasta dishes. One of the regular favorites: The Alfredo Veg and one of the specials wild mushroom risotto. The sauces for both pasta dishes were delicious - a perfect dipping vehicle for the bread. Both of the dishes were full of flavor and tasted incredibly different. They guys really great pizza. The sauce is perfection. The cheese is also outstanding as well as the crust. We did order the brownies and hot chocolate sauce and said we were going to share it. Both were dense and very good!

First we ordered stuffed mushrooms and honey chilli potatoes. Both the dishes were awesome but it would have been great if the chilli potatoes had a bit more sauce. Moving on to main course, we ordered dal makhni, kadhai paneer and fried rice. Even though i am not a daal lover, their daal made me fall in love with it.

However, the parking is a mess, though they have valet parking but the no of cars is such that it's hardly helpful. The food menu is a mixed bag comprising of all the cliche starters. We ordered the crispy corn, chilli paneer, veg and non veg platters. The food taste is better than average and the quantity is also good for the price. However, this place is obv not where you would want to go for food alone, it's a watering joint afterall.

Its located on the first floor at the outer circle very close to Starbucks and Blues and Barbeque Nation. The entry is very small, reminds you of hkv stairs leading to the top but once you are on the first floor, its a huge restaurant . The food is multi cuisine, the bar and the sitting is beautiful and is nice and comfortable. The service initially was a bit slow till taking of orders but after that no complaints.

Jasmeen G Dugal,"Rated Although it was not my first time dining in one of Priyank Sukhija's restaurants in the Capital's culinary landscape but it was my first time to come in with a mission and a specific purpose at The Town House Caf in Connaught Place to review one of the most popular restaurant-cum-hi energy lounge which made the afternoon a far more memorable event than I would have thought possible. From the moment you I stepped out of the lift on the second floor I became aware that I've entered into a dimension where time as we know it is suspended.. where light and color take on a more subtle hue.. with the focus being the tables with it's guests and the food and alcohol being served.. where sounds start with conversations that turn into approving murmurs of satisfaction as succulent dishes are enjoyed in a luxurious ambience with wooden arches.. black and red themed plush seating astride animal print table-and-chairs and a mammoth bar. For those who've not ventured to The Town House Cafe you should experience it to appreciate why it's in a class of its own whether you're lunching with family.. enjoying cocktails and EDM music (it's thoughtfully subtle or loud depending on where you choose the table).. or partying there on Saturday night. I knew based on experience at Priyank's other establishments that I was in for yet another memorable experience that would last over two hours! After all you don't rush good things.. you savor them! Once seated in a plush red sofa the server guided me through the ordering ritual and I began luncheon with 'Celery Infused Mozzarella Sticks' and 'Pan Roasted Prawns' while I waited for a friend who was stuck in traffic.. it went nicely with chilled Mojito. The fresh flavorful prawns were marinated in chilli-garlic sauce.. a treat for seafood lovers! The crumb-fried mozzarella was sinfully delicious served with celery-infused salsa that I kept dipping the sticks in. Yum! At that point my fried joined me and I asked the chef for his recommendation. It was bang on! He brought us a refreshing salad with spliced oranges crowning rocket and iceberg. What a merger of flavors.. the purrfect antidote for rainy days! Up next was a basket of vegetarian dim sums since my friend is vegan and 'Cloves Smoked Chicken Galuoti' for me. The tender melt-in-the-mouth kebabs were well-seasoned and seared to perfection. For entres we had a choice of Indian Oriental or Continental. Since I wanted something light the chef suggested his signature 'Sliced Chicken in Signature Rice Wine Sauce' with a portion of steamed rice.. it was fresh and flavorful. Time flew by as conversation flowed and it was difficult to stay put when the music was just so good.. and soon it was time to end the meal with brownies and hot chocolate sauce. The Town House Caf an expectation met and surpassed and true to regulars' claim that you'll ""experience fine dining in an ambience where time and place as we know it is suspended"". Bon Appetite!

The flavours are on point and the price is totally appropriate. Good food + Music is what i always seek for, the cherry on the cake sort of stuff is what you get there, when dj plays best of EDM, and Deephouse.

Rohini Gauba,"Rated The Town House Cafe in association with Hmm! and a few other food bloggers were invited for an event, called the THE TASTE OF THE WORLD. The title of the event justified the experience in all aspects. My eyes and taste buds were startled by the plethors of cuisines, all served on one table with perfect authentic touch added to every single dish. Out of the lot, the oven-fresh Tiger Skin bread served with cubes of butter and fresh salads was impressive. We had mildly-spiced Chicken Dumplings on one hand and white-sauce pasta with a generous amount of parmesan cheese on the other. The melt-in mouth mutton galouti's served with parantha's are a must. For vegetarians, they have introduced Mushroom Galouti's, based on the same lines as the mutton ones. Desserts- Passion fruit mousse with a good helping of the fruit jelly and Red Velvet Cake wrapped up our meal. As far as their mocktails are concerned, they are a little too sweet. This place has a long way to go. The Plush Interiors, Multi-Cuisine Menu, Attentive and well - informed staff, all point out towards more success for them in the coming days. Happy Eating!

Anshu Sharma,"Rated I've never liked an eating joint which does not respects customer satisfaction. Just a few hours back I was in an awe of a huge, dimly lit, spacious bar restaurant in the heart of the city. Only to find out that the entire space was empty and I couldn't choose a place to sit according to my comfort because seats were reserved. Managed to sit on a high bar stool with a friend along who had come from Bangalore and joined me for dinner. Minutes later a couple walks in without any reservation and they get a comfy sofa despite the waiter telling them all of the comfy seats were reserved. Called the manager called mehra/mehta only to be spoken rudely and without any regret of having treated us differently when they could've notched up by being polite and accommodating. The manager had no signs of being sorry, instead kept arguing with me illogically. Not only that, we ordered hummus pita bread for starters, to only find that they had served kulcha (YES) with hummus and salad. Having eaten across the city, this has been the worst experience ever! Randomly left the place after all the disaster, only to find the arrogant manager downstairs who had no smile or apologetic face even when we left after being disappointed. Sorry guys!

So we went on a dinner to this place , there was waiting for like 15 -20 min , but when we went upstairs there was no waiting , they just kept their tables reserved . But it was nice of them to manage the place for us. Ambience - we were seated at a nice red velvet surrounded enclosed table , the ambience of the place was quite gud , though people who visit it in the day time find the place quite dark. But in case of dinner the scenario was pretty and romantic , with red and black interiors , dim lightings and candles all over . Food - we were starving so straight away we ordered butter chicken makhani dal and humus and pita breads . Butter chicken was very nice , it had a nice taste to it , the gravy was quite appropriate , the makhani dal was a little too creamy but it was good , and the humus and pita breads were fine , i didn't like it too much , the breads were a little hard , but butter chicken and dal were quite good . Service - the service is good , the staff is really active and worked up as its a new place , though they were in a hurry , as they had more customers to seat , but the service was fine .

Now coming to the food, some sections of the a la carte are mouth watering, but the sandwiches are a great disappointment! The sheesha was good! This is a location in cp along with many other cafs which in comparison have a bit economical menu, but again the service and food. Covers this up! Now I found a bit different thing here, you get valet parking by townhouse and they charge 100 bucks and give you a 100rs discount coupon, which is to be handed over to the waiter before asking for the bill, but there were no discounts! It was a little thing which I couldn't overlook! Overall its a great place with good food, bad sandwiches, great ambience and a pricey menu! Cheers :)",Rated 1.0,10,91,??

Mohit Goel,"Rated Big Let Down when compared to Warehouse!! First visit and we were served Non-Veg after having ordered veg food. The waiters are new and have no idea what's on the menu, leave alone recommending something as per the taste of the customer. Dineout offer was refused even after having made a valid booking. Food taste was mediocre and quantities served were absolutely not value for money. Hookah was good! The only other nice things about the place were the comfortable sofas and the music. I would recommend to give it a skip and probably go try out Blues which is just downstairs!",Rated 1.5,7,27,??

Karan Agarwal,"Rated Extremely delicious food. For veg NACHOS is a must order & for Non-veg lovers, having Tandoori chicken here would make your visit more worth it. Great ambience, Huge BAR, good hookka, very courteous staff. Happy Hours until 9pm. The only downside- Music isn't very and fee people on weekdays",Rated 4.0,13,5,??
Akshay Gupta,"Rated This has GOT TO BE the new happening and ""buzzing with beats"" place in delhi. Centrally located. Easy to find. Next to the parking. Safe clean entrance. No fuss. It's HUUUUUUUGE. DIfferent ambience under one roof for all kinds of audience and foodies. Casual hot overdressed formals, you shall find a table for your mood. Bar menu is vast and so is well chosen food menu. Aperitifs are just great. Service is fast, reliable and with happy faces. Cost efficient, not cheap but it just matches any other good lounge club restaurant bar etc in delhi, it's just this is way ahead of them. Interiors as if have been personally chosen by Priyank Sukhija. Great Sheesha preparation. A rare, which is gooooood music gooood Dj and good ambient lighting. Honey singh is already hooked for a Saturday drop in to this place keeping in mind it just opened two days back. KEEP IT UP. <3",Rated 4.0,40,48,??
Gouri,"Rated It's a wonderful place to chill wid friends. I was der for a pvt Bday party. It is surely a must visit place!! Ambience-5/5 Music-5/5 Food-3.5/5 I would still like to put across one thing- management should hire more dedicated n active staff. As they are little complacent. Also, the owner should ensure that their staff is offering all the things mentioned in the package. Apart from that, I am sure this place will be at APOGEE soon!",Rated 4.0,3,4,??
