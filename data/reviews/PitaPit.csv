Suhail Arora,"A good pocket friendly chinese or thai restaurant in CP. We ordered crispy chili potato and a combo of thai redcurry with rice. Chili potato was good and curry rice were awesome. We ordered DARSAN as a dessert, which was more like Indian version of jalebi with vanilla ice cream but it was good. Mint Mojito were also good. It will be great if they can make the place a bit more with lights which can make the place more ambient.",3.5,44,56,??
Shikha, This sagar ratna is very old restaurant serving delicious dahi vada & scrumptious south Indian food. This place is loosing its charm due to poor service & dull ambiance. Average place to visit., 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Ashish Sarma," The sofas are torn... Not well maintained. We took one couch that looked OK.. But then were asked to vacate it since it was reserved - even though there was no sign placed on the table that indicated reservation. The waiter's attitude was below the standards of a supposedly good restaurant chain. The food is overpriced for the quality and quantity... There is a minimum standard of presentation that is expected but was not there. Overall an avoidable experience, specially the CP outlet... I have heard the other outlets are good and hence was hugely disappointed coming to this one.", 1.0,1,0,??

Akshat Kalra," So I bumped on to this place by accident. I was looking for The Townhouse Cafe and saw this Cafe. Man it was a great decision. Super amazing music played by the DJ on a chilly Friday night. Food - I drank too much that night and just had a white sauce spaghetti pasta. It was good, creamy and too many veggies ( I paid 80 bucks extra for the veggies). All in all a good experience. Had a lot of fun.", 4.0,19,55,??
