Ipsita Pallavi,"Rated The cheesy fries and the chicken nuggets is something I would suggest anyone to not miss. The milkshakes are good, too. The whole place is a bit cramped up, and does create a hassle on weekends.",Rated 4.0,21,29,??
Aditi Shahi,"Rated I was completely averse to the idea of ever walking into a burger king outlet, after my first horrible experience at one. It was only after Rishabh KumarKumar's persistent persuasion that I decided to give it a try again. We ordered the mutton whopper and cheesy fries, and both of them turned out to be pretty good. Loved the cheesy fries.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Shady Rohit Jha,Rated i visited burger king like 3-4 times and i must say thier chicken whooper is amazing. what i dont like about this place is that super aunty. hahaha who keep on having an eye on people who are finished eating. because they want more and more customers to come but they dont have much space.,Rated 3.0,11,30,??

Varun Kapoor,Rated I love burger king Big Boss Whooper but Cp's BK is degrading their quality as the foot fall is more and space n staff is less .. The preparation time was good enough but the way whooper was prepared was horrible all the stuffing was coming out of the bun... No sauces were properly put in and neither the burgers were hot.. I don't get it why they are imposing more on footfall instead of quality ... If they will sacrifice their quality definitely they will also end up like Mcd and dominos ..Bk your quality is damn good don't make it bad ... Your quantity and prices are too good .. But if you guys will make the quality bad I M sure no one is gonna step in again... First visit to cp store was good enough but in second visit we expected much more than first and ended up having a disastrously bad burger ... Hope you guys work on next time .. :) Yashika,Rated 3.5,21,280,??
Pravesh Khanna,"Rated No lie. I love burgers. And until now, I have always thought that Mcdonalds ruled the burger scene. However,Burger King has made me a believer.Where do I begin? The bun was perfect, the onions and tomatoes were fresh, the cheese was cheesy, and the chicken was perfectly fatty. Together they combine into a magical entity that closely rivals the burgers at Mcdonalds. Oh yeah, and the fries were perfectly cooked between crispy and soft.",Rated 4.5,4,76,??
Raman Singh,Rated Went to Burger King on a sunday evening around 4:00 and It was all packed but the lined moved quickly and the service was seriously one of the best I have seen at this type of places. we ordered the double cheese burger combo pack and It was more than enough to satisfy one's hunger. million times better than what you get at Mcdonalds. The bun was soft and the ingredients wee very fresh. certainly visiting next time..,Rated 4.5,8,57,??
Kartik Chawla,"Rated Burger king, the long awaited american food chain is finally in the Indian capital and it's growing faster than i ever thought. It is like McDonald's but also very different at the same time. The burgers are tasty and certainly have a different taste than other burgers. Also, it brings in a new variety of fries, onion rings and other stuff. It's nice to have something new in the same price range. Thumbs up to burger king.",Rated 4.0,35,99,??

Dhruv Gupta,"Rated I was very excited to see Burger King opening in my fav CP. My first visit to Burger King was good. I tried their crispy chicken burger with fries. But my subsequent visits made me realize that Burger King is an overhyped food chain. The ""chicken whopper burger"" is a major letdown. Also their dessert & side orders aren't that good. Shakes are quite good though. Burger King is average in terms of food taste. I would rather go to McDonalds or Dunkin Donuts for having a quick burger.",Rated 2.5,64,48,??
Shikha,"Rated Burger king has the most dull n dry burgers of all kinds in all denominations , their assortments of onion rings are too bad. Their whopper burger is bit pardonable due to its jalapeo filling n few sauces. Their 360 degree beverage / dessert sucks equally, mc Donalds is far far better then BK anyday.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Abhilash Baishya,Rated This place is one of the most packed around the block. A friend and I were in Delhi for some work for a few days. This was our daily lunch place. Had The Crispy Chicken combo meal those days and I don't think you get a better deal under 100 anywhere near given how good the burgers and the fries were. Would visit every time I'm in the capital for a quick bite or even lunch. Or dinner. Heh. Service is super quick. 4/5,Rated 4.0,31,146,??

The Great Indian Foodie :P,"Rated Preferred take-away, don't think for stay long here, Pretty small outlet compare with McDonald in same region and other Burger Kings's Outlet. Divided into two halves, ground floor and upper ground floor area with low capacity of sitting area. Located in E-Block Middle circle, below to MY BAR. Being a busiest place surely it would affect the services. hence it was little bit slower. Food Quality and taste is standardized at all its outlet.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Akash Gupta,"Rated This place is located in inner circle of cp. We order there whoopers, panner king,and shakes. Whooper is their largest burger on their menu. It is good in taste but its tikki is very very oily. So if you are buying this pls consider it. In panner king panner is good and I can say its avg. In shakes I tried mango n chocolate. Mango is quite good and its chilled n fulfilled my expectations. Chocolate shake is not good and even not so chilled. It is a bit pricey compared to other buger chains. Ambiance of the place is very good, n place is quite clean. So my rating is 3 out of 5. Happy eating.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Ekam,Rated Burger king. When you don't want to hit mc'd for a casual bite on a chilly winter in Delhi you can go and visit Burger King. Burger king with all due respect to Mc'd brings a thing or two which for now tastes new. The example for that will be the Italian cheesy fries or the bolt drinks. They have decent burgers too. I like BK Veggie much better than Mc Veggie. There Non Veg are better too as Mc'd non veg burgers are just plain bland. If you are a big burger fan do give them a visit it'll be worth every crown you will wear and post those selfies on social networks.

Kaustav Datta - Foodiepanda,"Rated Definitely my FAVORITE burger place in Delhi!! This place is a value for money fastfood joint and never disappoints. Have been here more than once and always loved the food Here's a quick yet detailed review of my visits here. AMBIANCE: Located in the inner circle on E Block, the place is easy to find. Despite having two floors dedicated to sit-and-dine, the place is almost ALWAYS crowded and inevitably, its hard to find a table to sit. The place has a seating capacity of approx 70 people. SERVICE: The staff here is very swift and agile. Unlike other fast food chains where service is slow and dragging at times, this place is wonderfully fast in taking your orders and handing them out accurately and in no time. FOOD: We generally take the Chicken Whopper Meal (when in an America based burger joint, how can you miss the WHOPPER! !) and replace the fries in the order with Cheesy Chicken Fries and Cheesy Italian Fries. Thus the total order consists of: - Chicken Whopper Meal (regular) - Cheesy Italian Fries - Cheesy Chicken Fries The Whopper is a MAGNIFICENT BEAST of a Burger in itself! Delicious, succulent Chicken Patty placed between fresh bread sliced with Mayonnaise on the inside, and stacked with thin sliced onions and leaves of cabbage, the burger is a sure delight here. The challenge, however, is to eat the burger along with the fries and make sure you finish the burger! Such is the size of this beauty!! The fries are so DREAMY !! You get the sensation of heaven in your mouth once you taste the gooey cheesy fries with Chicken gravy or tangy Italian sauce poured over them. The fries are certainly my most favorite ones I've ever had at a fast food joint. I wish more and more joints here were creative enough to have some amazing sides likes this one to accompany their meals! VALUE FOR MONEY (VFM): The place is definitely a high VFM place. I find their meals perfectly priced and sumptuous. Also, the quantity served is amazing so you sure feel full by the time you have a meal for two of the size I've mentioned. Pocketpinch for two: Rs. 550 /- approx ---------------------------------------------------------------- Ambiance: 3.5/5 Service : 4/5 Food : 4.5/5 VFM : 4.5/5 Overall : 4.5/5",Rated 4.5,88,1067,??
Karan Narula,"Rated One of the first burger king outlets in Delhi, this one is just as good as any other. The burgers are good for a try, with the whoppers stealing the show. I tried the double mutton whopper on my last visit which was really full and delicious! This time out I tried the chicken tandoor grill burger which is one of its Indian variants but is not upto my expectations. The variety of sides is great, with the different cheesy fries, the nuggets and strips going nicely with the burgers. It's a good burger place you can visit once in a while!!!",Rated 3.5,34,111,??
Archit Khanna,"Rated Went there with two of my friends to have a snack at around 4 in he evening since it is the most hyped food joint coming to India for the first time. To my surprise ,it wasn't that great than expected. Just another burger joint like MCD and KFC.No specialty noticed in whooper either. I would rate 3.5 for this.",Rated 3.5,20,62,??
Kamlesh Rawat,Rated Had a chicken whopper burger 3 days back at cp outlet. It was so fresh n petty was nicely minced. That is called preparation.

Aadya Dua,"Rated Today I decided to try Burger King's Crispy Veg. Combo which comprises of a Crispy Veg. burger, small fries and a small Pepsi @ Rs. 69 but amounts to Rs. 85 with taxes. I came here along with two of my friends - it was around 4.30 p.m and the place was packed but luckily as soon as we reached, a table vacated and we grabbed it. The place has got a really nice vibe to it with it's bright coloured walls and paper lanterns. It was my first time at Burger King and the prices seem quite reasonable. I opted for the Crispy Veg. Combo and one of my friend also opted for the same while the other one decided to go for a Crispy Chicken Combo - all this cost us Rs. 262 with taxes. Now coming to the food, the burger seemed a bit small especially when compared to McAloo Tikki. I'm sorry but comparisons with McDonald are inevitable! Also, the burger didn't pack much flavour - it was low on sauce, the patty wasn't crispy enough and it only had onions. The burger was just okay - nothing special! The quantity of the fries was dissapointing and they could've been more crispy but were decent enough. What can I say about the drink? :p It only had Pepsi and no unnecessary ice so, that's good. So, the Crispy Veg burger failed to impress me but I'll be back to try the other burgers soon! P.s. Burger King doesn't charge anything for extra ketchup sachets.",Rated 2.0,18,25,??

Yusuf Khan,"Rated Too bad, I happen to visit it on a Sunday. There was not even a single tile of floor to step on, I had to wait with my order for sometime before finally getting placed at a shared table, which was not very comfortable..

Mukta Dhawan,"Rated We just landed up here for a quick meal after an important business meet and it got so much late that no other place here at CP was available. I asked the waiiter for a quick stomach filling burger and he suggested the whopper one. well, its size really amazed me. i couldn't eat it full, it was too much for me and the taste was also just about fine. I liked the chocolate shake a lot though. Altogether, for me, it was not an happening place really but just okayish types.",Rated 3.0,111,569,??
Anjali Rathore,Rated Only we knew about the Mc Ds Burger before this place had come into vogue. But now it has made a niche in the genre of burgers and especially its whooper is winning accolades. First of all it is so very giant that its an exercise eating it out. It had a lot of stuff to explore down especially the sauces. The rates were very reasonable and good. It is enough for a single meal!,Rated 4.0,20,160,??

Else everything was perfect.staff was very interactive specially the floor manger. They have concern abt customer feeling.i seriously recomnend if u really want to taste good burger. Value for money.,Rated 4.5,1,0,??
Paras,Rated Been to this burger king joint many times with friends and always felt very happy with the good and service . There are many counters 4-5 to be precise . Honestly the burger king joints are better than mc finales as the prices are similar or lower in most cases and the burgers and fries are both bigger than that of other main stream fast food burger joint. The extra long chicken sandwich and the mutton whopper meal is my all time classic combination . The whopper is massive and the meat is pretty juicy and nice . The extra long chicken comes with lots of good veggies and sauces inside it . The fries can be upgraded to kind fries and the coke can be switched for KE bolt which is just ice ganga flavour drinks . They are very nice and chilling . The classic chicken is an amazing deal as I personally don't like to have burgers in fast food joint with lettuce or cabbage as I don't feel that sage . The classics chicken comes with a thousand island sauce and onions and a chicken patty which is very nice honestly . All in all the experience is always great and quantity and quality to price ratio is better than most places. Space is a constraint for this outlet and its completely occupied most of the times. But food here makes the waiting worth. Also the staff is very polite and cooperative. I seriously recommend others to visit Burger King.,Rated 4.5,1,1,??
Prabhat Bhatia,Rated I visited this place and ordered 3 Whooper and it was fantastic & Fresh..

Foodie@Prannay,"Rated Just love the burgers of this place. It beats McDonald's burger in terms of variety and taste. Try its chicken tikka whopper and other variety of whooper burgers.

Saumya Kaushik,"Rated So, on the eighth day of the New Year I decided to dine out at Burger King. To my reaponse, the place was crowded enough for us to wait for five minutes to grab a seat for four. Later on, the waiter while cleaning the table spilled some left out coke on the table. French Fries were hard to chew, harder to swallow. The coke was half water with 4-5 tiny ice cubes in the glass. Our bill amounted around 650 bucks and it was sheer waste of money. Digusted at the management of the CP branch.",Rated 1.5,16,73,??
Reetika Ralhan,"Rated An American food chain opening in India was really in the talks and everyone being excited to visit this place. Well, the CP outlet is very small and conjested. And there is no such ambience or anything of that sorts. I visited this place with my friends and we ordered the veg and the chicken whopper and chicken chili cheese. The whoppers were tasteless. Chicken was bland. But I did like the chicken chili cheese. It was nice, better that whopper. I couldn't really understand why people were so eager to try this place. It's an ok ok place.",Rated 3.0,25,27,??
Asmita,"Rated Contrary to popular belief, I'm not going to rant about its comparison to it's International branches. Their menu and food quality do enough justice to the Indian taste palette.You've got to try the things they've put on especially keeping in mind the Indian taste buds! The burger buns are soft, the chicken is well done and the spice is right. Their Chicken Tandoori Grill is a must try! ( For all those chicken and mild spice lovers). We also had the Chicken Keema Crunch which also did justice, the combination of the tender chicken and crunchiness of the burger really went well ! The space is small and tight in this outlet, but it's like any other running food chain that needs to cater to a rather large population ! After the response, I'm sure the chain is looking for larger spaces, if not multiple outlets. If you're looking for burgers that'll fit your pocket and leave you happy, this is the place to be!",Rated 4.0,1,0,??

Sneha Khanna,"Rated Was wanting to visit burger king at saket in the 1st week of its opening in Delhi. But the long ques din't make it happen then. After the CP outlet opened I finally made it here. I had ordered paneer king which made me feel this place was over hyped since the burger was ordinary.. nd so did my friend felt about the chicken whopper, but the chilli cheezos were really nice along with the sweet chilli dip. The chocolate shake too was pretty good. My 1st experience was overall great..so I further tried their other burgers when burger king became prevlant in nearly every food court in delhi..the bk veggie, chilli cheese...all of them were good and a change from the McDonald's burgers too. My review is particularly about my last visit at burger king where I ordered the big boss veg whopper. That was an outstanding burger. It was huge, messy, cheesy, spicy and crunchy. Knowing that it's a limited edition burger upsets me, so before it goes it's a must try. I also quite lyked the new cheesy fries. Though I find the seating at CP outlet clumsy and always a trouble at any time of the day. But the service is quick with a friendly staff. And now really glad to know that burger king has started home delivery. The expansion of the chain has been great.",Rated 4.0,24,82,??
SK Pathak,"Rated After months of walking by Burger King (and having received recommendations from friends to dine there!), I finally stopped in for a meal and was very satisfied with my meal. I ordered their tandoor chicken burger, cooked medium rare, and it was delicious. My friend ordered the mutton whopper and mentioned it was one of the best burgers he's had in a while. I found their fries to be OK - maybe next time I'll ask them to make them extra crispy. And the service was spot on - we were checked on by several people throughout our meal, which was a nice touch. Next time I'm in the mood for a burger, we'll definitely be heading back to Burger King.",Rated 4.5,3,43,??

Coming to the food now. Undoubtedly liked their BK veggie. The extra cheese slice put up was like the cherry on the cake. Amazingly better. For sure they just broke the monotony of other branded burger brands in India. But yeah its very obvious that you will have to look for the vacant tables all the time following the heavy footfall. And yes a perfect place for the burger craving! You will like it. Cheers! :),Rated 4.0,10,0,??

With so many good burger places around (McDonalds 100+range, Dunkin, KFC and now Carl's Jr., that might be in CP soon), I wouldn't like to hold my meal tray and keep waiting for a space.

Chhavi,"Rated First visit at Burger King after gathering all the courage to stand in the long queue of this CP branch. Maybe the space on the ground floor is too small coz they also have seating arrangement. Ideally, a better option would be to have seating only upstairs with order placement on the ground floor. The overall experience of not entering this place so many times before was due to the queue which appeared long due to space constraint. Coming to the point now - Burgers!! I heard a lot about Whooper chicken so I had to order it. It has grilled chicken with tomatoes, onions, olives and other veggies and lot of sauces. The bun was soft. It was good but nothing WoW! I would still prefer KFC zinger, if given a choice. Grilled chicken burger was the most economical out of the non veg list. A good option for a quick snack. Nuggets were just friend coating with no juicy chicken. Did not like them. Overall, a very pocket friendly place for students. My branded burger experience in India would be KFC > Burger King > Mc Donald's.",Rated 3.0,87,269,??
Sunmeet Singh Sethi,"Rated This again was checked out by me after a hectic exam day and obviously taste buds and tummy combinedly need energy after a long exam. Planning was to hop in to Domino's for the 1+1 meal but ended up here just because this place came on my way to Domino's and my ""Try Something New"" rule sparked. Tried out Veg Whopper with Combo and Big Boss Whopper for the evening. Though am a chicken lover but I do try veg food often, so this evening was surrendered for veg burger. Veg Whopper was really a nice whopper. With a Potato Tikki, which had stuffing of peas and defined spices, Cabbage Leaves, Uncle Chips, Different Ketchups, Tomato and Onion Slices - this was surely something unique to have. If you aren't a foodie and don't have much capacity tummy, you wouldn't need French Fries or the combo part. Have it with Tomato Ketchup, it would taste even better. But for me Big Boss Whopper was in no comparison with Veg Whopper. Bigger, larger, snackier, cruchier, spicier, crispier and what not. This was surely something which turned the tables for me. This burger is only for promotional period, so hurry and try this out !! Nice ambience with perfect lighting, soothing music in background and superb sitting arrangement - this is really the place to hangout with friends and family. Forget McDs, Burger King is here. With Carls Jr. also coming, it would be nice to see how Kings put their next foot down for this battle. Kudos !!",Rated 4.5,54,420,??

Urvika Jhamb,"Rated After years of waiting , Burger King brought the whopper to the capital ! I ordered the mutton whopper with fries and onion rings . The mutton whopper was perfectly smokey and meaty with a consistent bun to burger to veggies ratio and the onion rings somehow had the pizza mcpuff from McD flavour which I absolutely loved ! Fries were pretty standard. Since then I've had the mutton whopper without fail whenever I visit burger king !",Rated 4.5,17,375,??

Ananta Roy,"Rated I have been craving burgers off late and hence I couldn't afford to miss this ever popular chain. I visited this outlet during lunchtime and it was crowded. Its located in the E block of inner circle CP. I ordered the Veg whopper burger with a black coffee. The burger is unusually big in diameter and isn't as tall for its size. But thats the good part,giving you a firm grip to have all the good filling at a go without spilling. I was impressed by their sesame topped soft bun.They were really soft. The filling inside apart from the crispy vegetable patty had the green peas, lettuce,onions,tomatoes and its signature sauce with mayo.The patty was crisp and fresh but the flavour punch was missing and the sauces weren't anything special.The mayonnaise overpowered any other sauce they might have used. Its a good burger but I would't rate it as something special. And the patty is a bit spicy too which is also a good part. I would definitely rate this burger higher than the McD's Spicy paneer which tasted dull to me. Black coffee was piping hot and as usual I always love them. If you are a burger lover, you must definitely drop in here. Recommended.",Rated 3.5,66,358,??

Ritika Vaswani,"Rated Now there is a big competition for McDonalds, burger king is here. I took my friend to go with me to try their burgers at their CP outlet. The first outlet opened up in select city walk, Saket. After looking up at their menu, it could definitely be said that they had done a lot of research to make the menu fit for the people of India. They are famous for their beef burger world wide, but removed it from the Indian menu considering the sentiments of the people here. With a large product range , they are attempting to make a burger to suit every persons pocket. Their ambience is not an interesting one. They have ground and 1st floor area. Athough thinking about the Cp, we couldnt think of anything better. There will be definitely waiting period of 20 min if u want to sit and enjoy food there, due to small and packed room. And then coming to food, we ordered-. Veg whooper- It was really good just loved it. The patty was crisp and made perfectly. Non-veg whooper- this was the better one. The patty was just wooww.And it surely takes two hand to handle the whooper. Fries- they are larger, crispier and better than that from the other. Orange Frost- this was ok. This is a good change for all the burger lovers.",Rated 4.0,68,175,??

Though The outlets of this brand in India have not met to the standards that they serve abroad , nevertheless I think each time I have munched at Burger King I see a improvement or something better that has come up . Writing about this particular outlet , the ambience is pleasant , the Staff is helpful , polite and energetic . My favourite burgers are the chicken whopper & the new chicken keema crunch . Their burgers are fresh and the patties in them are always crunchy and mouthwatering . I like their new cheese fries and the various variants available in them , but I think the quantity that they serve is too less . I would especially like to mention the amazing elaichi tea that they serve ( because of which my mom agrees to go to Burger King with me ) & that I enjoy with my burger on a late winter evening .

The taste obviously differed from McD's Aloo tikki burger since this has bbq sauce and McD has mayo. But it is worth a quick grab.

AMBIENCE - The ambience is just average just like any other KFC or McDonalds, keeping in mind the big brand name it is a bit of a downside, that there is different from the competition FOOD - Being a vegetarian, I ordered a crispy veg and a veg whopper.The crispy veg was below average compared to the Mc Aloo Tikki or the KFC snacker but if you want to try something different then you can give it a try. The veg whopper is the edge off compared to other food joints because of its size and taste. It's almost 1.5 times size of a normal burger and tastes really nice with the right amount of chilly, crispy and refreshing flavour . There are also crusher like beverages to compliment You can also make a combo of Fries and Coke at 50 Still I give it 3.5 stars as I was hoping for something new in the menu but there is nothing that you won't find in any other food chain joints",Rated 3.5,19,460,??
Dillikabhukkad,"Rated Nothing good is expected from the indian outlets of burger king and they dont even try to change that petception of indian foodies. 1) The fries are sometimes thick as promised, while sometimes are completely opposite of what they portray. 2) the chicken and mutton whoppers are a big big disappointment. The char grilled patties dont have any flavour and the burgers although huge dont have adequate sauces. You have to tell them specifically to get their attention towards it. 3) the orange slush is so sweet that it feels like having sugary water.

Jatin Dev,"Rated The service is quick and clear. The burgers are neat and clean. So, Why don't I feel excited? Because I don't find anything exciting. Once you sit inside, it is hard to tell if it's McD or KFC. The flame grilled concept is nice but is more volume focused than excitement focused. The Chicken Tandoor patty is the juiciest and tastiest but it comes in a singular small size and has almost no condiments. The whopper comes in different sizes but tastes like a mass produced chicken patty. However the Keema crunch tastes deliciously like the indigenous Keema Pao and the chilli cheese is a good grab and go option. But still why don't I feel excited? Because I don't find anything exciting.",Rated 3.0,53,152,??
Beast Preenon,"Rated So Friday night my family and I decided to drop by the CP burger king. We had quite a large order of 2 chicken whoppers 2 bbq grill burgers 4 drinks 8 fiery rings 2 fries and 2 sundaes. The bbq burgers were quite alright, nothing special the flavours did work well together but the burger really lacked that X factor that would elevate it. Similarly the chicken whopper was just OK. I really hate the fact that the chicken whopper has such a thin chicken patty! The burger itself is above average but then again it's priced at 180 and is nothing great I'd eat a zinger or McSpicy any day of the week. The fries were extremely salty, perhaps instead of sprinkling salt over the fries they tossed them in it! The fiery rings were crisp and tasted good but they had a off smell of oil which was really not pleasant. The sundaes were absolutely great an excellent combination of classic vanilla ice cream with delicious chocolate and strawberry sauces. In the last 5 months since burger king opened up in India I've been very optimistic about it. Mlany people have doubted it and it is perhaps the most polarising restaurant in Delhi. Some hate it and some love it. But after giving it multiple tries, hoping for its success burger king has constantly disappointed me; getting the basics wrong like fries and the pricing of your burgers is just sinful. So despite me wanting to love it; Burger king I do not like you. Definitively I won't be back.",Rated 2.5,97,464,??

Fair warning it might get a little tideous to order owing to all the shouting and thank-you's being passed around by the employees to them selves. A first I have witnessed. And just for that I give them a half point more. If you have never visited a burger king before, visit it for this sole purpose.

I had a mutton whopper and the patty was the thinest that i have ever seen in a burger(yet for some reason i found it adequate? Maybe i was just starving). I found mango tango quite refreshing. And the italian cheese fries could use a little more cheese and a little less tangy sauce. Nothing much to say really..just an average fast food outlet.

I finally made it to a Burger King, but didn't had chicken whooper as it was navratra and skipped chicken for my first visit :( So we thought of settling down on a Paneer King meal and Xtra long Mexican veg, replaced the cold drink with chocolate milk shake for the meal. Paneer King was normal pretty much the me too burger available in almost all the burger places across the nation, there was nothing special about it which can distinguish it from other Burger destinations for Veggie burgers. Xtra long Mexican veg was a welcome change, the taste was slightly different though the bread was a bit odd shaped. :P I liked the Mexican veg as it is slightly different from many options I get. Moreover, what I observed that this place had all the female employees. I guess this was something special about this specific outlet. Overall it's a nice place and add to options if someone wishes to have a decent burger. This review is entirely based on the Veg menu on the item which is not a perfect representation for the place.

Havyas,Rated It's a standard fast food joint which offers stomach filling food. Their signature offering is The Whopper. It comes in both Veg & Non - Veg. One thing which I like about these international fast food chains when they operate in India is that they respect the Indian sentiments - Beef and Pork Products strictly Prohibited. Had a Veg Whopper this time. It's not for people with small appetite. You will get tired of munching in this burger and it won't finish. Filling experience but not very high grade on taste.

Manisha Bhartiya,Rated The wide range of burgers available here mesmerized me big time as so much quantity is hardly visible today at such a price point. It is definitely a value for money deal as a whooper costs you less than 200 bucks and fills your stomach for the whole day and brings a wide smile on the faces of your loved ones when you take them along here. I would highly recommend this place to all the burger lovers and who have a fetish for it like me. It has been registered in my list of favorite burger restaurants forever now.,Rated 5.0,1,2,??

The Tandoor Chicken burger is basically a piece of meat that does not taste like any tandoori at all which is usually this smoky taste, plus 2 onion rings, lots of mint sauce between 2 pieces of bread.

The whooper is the most popular burger available here which is available both for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. It was so big and loaded with cheese and mutton that I did not eat anything for the rest of the day. It is also pocket friendly and the ambience of the place is also very cozy and friendly.

What I disliked the most was Onion Rings (Oops they call it Fiery Rings here, the taste isnt upto the mark at all). Secondly there is an option where you can make combos of a burger, drink along with onion rings/fries (But here they dont do that with onion rings, maybe Pyaaz k rate yahan par consistent nahi hain isliye :P) Whooper always had been BK's USP and here also its the best they have.

We ordered the Famous Whopper, Crispy Veg, Cheesy Fries, Cheesy Italian Fries and Thick Shakes. The double patty Whopper stood upto our expectations. Cheesy (and Italian) Fries are worth mentioning as it is different from what offered at other places and Italian sauce adds to the flavor making it a must have! We also loved the thick shakes.

But they have kept in mind the indian standards and then statred to serve us. The burgers are not that bad but have their own unique taste. They cannot be compared to Mcdonalds for sure. The menu is loaded with options in fries as well as burgers which is really good as we all love to have more options. The Cheese fries and Mutton Whooper is awesome.

After trying the Chicken or Mutton Whopper in your first visit, you should try the Chicken Tandoor Grill, Chicken Chili Cheese Melt or Chicken Keema Crunch...all three are really good for the Indian tastes. Though my favorite in chicken burgers is their signature Grilled Chicken Burger as i don't like Indian flavors in my burger.. In vegetarian menu the Veg Chili Cheese melt and BK veggie are really good.. Must try the cheese topped fries, onion rings and Cheezos (Veg or Non Veg any) I somehow didn't like the cheese fries with chicken..it was too oily for my liking. The service is great in this outlet.

The moment I saw it, I was thankful that I didn't order the king size one. The burger was really delicious, it had really been prepared well. The chicken patty was juicy and fresh, all the veggies were well laid out and plentiful, it didn't seem overloaded but neatly prepared. I was really impressed by the quality of the burger.

Anuj Sankla,Rated Been to this place with a few friends of mine. Had heard a lot about their whoopers so we ordered mutton whopper and chicken whooper and grilled chicken burger . Those were huge but bland.. They should have experimented with flavours in it.. such a huge burger with same taste all over makes it dull after a while.

Arjun Pmm,"Rated READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE CHEATED...A common marketing strategy that all these chains are using these days: they ask if you want a medium size or large size fries/drink in the combo. What you actually don't realize is that they are not telling you the third option, i.e, regular size. The price that is shown on the menu is for the REGULAR size. They charge extra if you want the medium or large size fries/drink which they do not mention. Also, they would directly ask you if you want the burger with single cheese or double cheese. They are again withholding the information that you can opt for the burger without cheese as well. Again, you are charged extra for the cheese, which they do not bother to mention. I am going to expose the scam that these large brands are pulling off on social media. Support me by liking, sharing the review if you care and would not want more people to be cheated the same way.",Rated 2.5,30,95,??

I have selected here CP as Tagore garden is not available in the option as I went to Pacific Mall outlet today. Now the review, we tried 3 burgers- Chicken Whopper, Mutton Whopper and another chicken meal i do not remember the exact name. The quality of the bun is top notch however the taste is not really tempting and does not push you to visit the outlet again (that's my personal opinion). I ordered a double cheese burger but i did not feel the same melting cheese that we are so fond of either KFC or McDonalds. moreover the chicken patty was not at all crisp. Really disappointed as was expected so much from this big brand.",Rated 3.0,55,350,??

Akanksha,"Rated This was just like any other burger chain (read McDonalds' / KFC) in my opinion. Nothing extraordinarily great to mention about the place. The ambience is like that of any other fast food restaurant. We ordered a spicy bean royale and a whopper chicken burger, along with a mango shake and cheesy fries. The spicy bean royale was extremely spicy, to say the least. It tasted well, but the spices were a little over the top. The whopper chicken was good, but in my friend's opinion (the one who had the burger), KFC has better chicken burgers. The fries were not good. The cheesy sauce was not cheesy and was very little in quantity barely covering the entire portion. The mango shake was thick and good though. But one thing alone does not make up for it. The worst thing here was the ill-maintained washroom. I wonder if they have house-keeping here! :-| Overall, I wouldn't be too keen to going again if there are other options for a quick bite.",Rated 3.0,10,16,??
Dishant Kumar,"Rated It was my first outing to Burger King and my experience was average.Like it was expected, the place was totally jam packed. We had to wait outside for our turn. We decided to have Chicken grilled burger, but to our disappointment they had only whopper at that time. Our order had all sorts of things like Chicken Whopper, Paneer King Burger, Fiery rings, Cheesy Italian fries, mango tango and pink limon.Talking about each thing, our main dish, whopper, was big let down. The patty was cold, too much to raw toppings and low on juiciness. Paneer King was still better than whopper.Cheesy Italian fries was of namesake only as the main ingredient that is cheese was not at all sufficient in the dish. Though it had some lip smacking flavors. It could have been better. Fiery rings were the best of lot. Served hot, but on the other hand they serve extremely small quantity of dips. I had to ask extra of them at the counter.and finally I loved both the drinks, especially Pink Limon.My experience was average. Staff was polite and helping.Ambience was nice.",Rated 2.5,14,35,??
Mahendra Kumar,"Rated *the 10th review leading to expertise in Connaught Place * The one similarity about global fast food chain restaurants is that the are similar in one way or another. Burger King being no exception. Standard bright ambience as expected, fried fast food which the Americans swear by, though I'm not complaining about the taste factor obviously. Whenever such foreign brand restaurants enter the Indian food scene they are accepted with open arms (or mouth as I may say). So one fine afternoon we friends decided to gorge on 'delicious calories'. Situated in a surprisingly small corner of inner circle this place have seating in two levels, and the crowd is almost consistent so grabbing seats can be a tedious job. Service is super quick, no complaints about that. Coming to food we decided to try the chicken grilled burger which sadly wasn't available, therefore chicken whopper it was along with the simple fries, newly introduced cheesy Italian fries, fiery rings, paneer king melt burger and the sodas. The whopper was quite huge but sadly it tasted a bit bland, lacking enough flavours. The Rings and fries were okayish. And the overall experience was pretty average as expected.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

However for our country they introduced the new Whoopers (Veg, Chicken, Mutton). The place was almost full as i went there on a friday night but i managed to find a place for two. I opted for Veg Whooper and my friend had a Chicken Whooper with Pink Lemon and Mango Tango to go with it. The burgers were really nice, tasty, juicy and fresh. I once had there grilled chicken burger in hong kong and would highly recommend that but did not tried it in india as i am a vegetarian now.

Been there just once and it was so terrible that I was left with no courage let alone will to spend even a single ""Phooti Kauri"". 1. No Place to sit as pointed out by Govind Rajputas well. 2. Too messy and too packed almost all the time. I failed to understand how come management had no idea that this is going to happen. Disastrous planning and miserable execution. 3. The food quality was pathetic. I agree with Kriti Sinha. I looked at burger and wondered why the hell did I pay for it and how am I going to eat it. I congratulated myself one it was in my stomach. I have no courage to throw the food away when this country has half a population malnourished and 1/3 does not have access to food even for once a day. 4. I am not sure what sort of business strategy it is. The manager of the outlet was working in the McDonald a few weeks ago and was miserable with her skills. She is performing the same way here as well. Bad, Bad experience, Will never suggest anyone ""at least this outlet"" for sure.",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Rishabh Lohia,"Rated So I am confused because I did not find anything different from what Mcdonalds offers, rather Mcdonalds has more variety and flavor. I found the burgers to be a big rip off because there was less meat and more bread! There was nothing impressive on their menu except the mutton whopper which reminded me of the Wimpy's mutton burger. I am still of the opinion that Wimpy's burger was far better. I personally feel that if I really wanted a burger, I would rather go for a gourmet burger with a decent piece of meat and veggies. The Burger King burgers were a facade.",Rated 3.0,2,74,??

Taran Sikka,"Rated Let's talk about the much awaited and one of the most popular burger chains of the U.S.A. To begin with there was a lot of hype with the chain trying to sell its burgers through ebay. However, I'm sorry to say that all the hype is not really worth it.Talking about this particular outlet, it was very crowded. It was hard to find a seat at first. The second challenge is standing in a queue. The way the outlet has been designed, kudos to the management. There is hardly any space left for a queue.What amazed me further was that there flies flying around inside the outlet and there is nothing the management can do about it. Imagine flies sitting on your tasty burgers! A good way to lose apetite .I would say the service is quite good at handling the crowd. The orders were dispatched quickly and the staff was cooperative.Our order consisted of Ice bolt Raspberry blues and pink limon(hope I've got the name right), cheese fries, italian cheese fries, a veg whopper and the chicken whopper. Now I have to say I tried, I tried again and again but I couldn't find the ice in the icebolt. It was just flavored cold water! The whopper was interesting. It was probably one of the most humongous burgers I've ever come across but that's all about it. I didn't find any lettuce in the burger. There was no dressing inside. I don't know if it's meant to be this way but the burger was actually bland and I didn't find it worth the money. The fries were a savior. They tasted great. Not too salty, nicely topped with layer of liquid cheese. However, there wasn't much different between the italian fries and the regular cheese fries. probably just the olives. Honestly, I would recommend them to improve the standards of their burgers a bit. People making a beeline for such burgers will not last long. It is just the hype, otherwise they are a letdown! Please keep the outlets cleaner! I still find Mc Donalds and KFC better in terms of burgers although the quality is deteriorating for the former. I would recommend people to wait till the hype dies out. Probably then we can know where their burgers stand.",Rated 2.5,32,109,??

Speaking of, crispy chicken is the answer, it might not be a buffed up burger or a double triple patty thing, but it has got an amazing crispy chicken patty which is married with the mayo and ketchup.

If you are planning to visit it soon and if you are a non-vegetarian you must try 'Xtra long Chicken burger' it was delicious! Also the cheapest one but certainly not the worst was 'crisp chicken burger'. These two turned out to be pretty good especially after the not so good 'chicken chilly burger' and 'tandoori burger'.

Araghni Chatterjee,"Rated This is a well known USA chain. They have recently ventured into India as all other brands looking at Indian market as good mine. I've been to this place on 9th March,2015. The place is located inside many turns of Cannaught place. They got a very small sized joint. So of course the place is always crowded even on weekdays. Now let's come to point: Pros: 1. The food quality is good. Some of them are better in taste than McD. Some of them are of really big size. 2. Staff suggestions are quite good. Cons: 1. The place is very small, so its always crowded. We had to wait on a weekday daytime. 2. I've been to Abu Dhabi airport burger king. To be honest, there is a difference in quality and quantity. 3. You might miss the place if you are going for the first time. It's located at a shy corner of cannaught place.",Rated 3.5,17,64,??
Pratyush Mohapatra,"Rated Hearing the entire commotion of Burger King opening up in the city, couldn't resist myself from tasting the Whoppers. Well a small suggestion, don't get too fascinated by the pictures on their menu or anywhere on the web because the actual product is seems more of a spoof of these projected images. We went ahead with the Double Patty Mutton Whopper along with Medium Fries and Coke. Well no doubt the burger size is huge but to my utter surprise seemed really flat as the patty size was way too thin. Secondly paying almost Rs 300 for a burger at least should guarantee you something more than just burger buns, two over cooked mutton patties and a sprinkle of ketchup with a few generous onion slices. The only saving grace had to be the Italian Cheese Fries which was something different from the regular fare. All in all utterly disappointed by the brand which proclaims itself to be the King of the Burger domain !!",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Burger king can't survive the Indian market if it's food tastes as bland. The orange slush tasted of synthetic flavour which was not at all pleasant.

Why you didnt deem it fit to introduce Dr Pepper and frozen fanta cherry ICEE is still a mystery to me. India would devour it and love it. The basic meal price is almost the same as in the USA so they didnt play with our emotions here. Increase your outlets to the east and north east of India too and who knows all might be flipping at BK. When I was small we all knew one thing- great men(scientists and doctors and engineers) begin their income trail by flipping burgers at Burger King.

We sometimes take for granted d effort that these guys at the back of the counter make. But I guess one must give them their due. When I entered, I found the store manager giving a morning briefing to d staff and each staff, all of them girls listening attentively, soaking it all in, getting ready to serve people like us. Coming back to the food I ordered a combo meal of a chicken tandoor grill burger, fries and a cappuccino. The first bite of the burger made me a fan of this place. The bun was fresh and soft.

This is nothing but another ordinary burger chain which provides burgers with different names and in case of WHOPPER,different sizes. Price is as reasonable as that of McD or KFC. Quality is great,quantity is good and prices fits one's pocket. So it has become another fast food joint for those who are tired to roam around CP or they were not able to find any space in McD,so this becomes a viable option. Talking about its menu,it has wide variety of burgers and they have also got a rs.50 add-on for a meal which is quite good For a vegetarian,the whopper will be a best choice that too with a Regular meal. Whopper is a little big in size and somehow one will find it as the elder brother of McAloo Tikki but with some extra veggies. French Fries are good and are seved in good quantity.

Anjali Das,"Rated The only thing worth having here is chicken tandoor grill burger with rock-it fries (which is nothing but fries tossed in sweet chilli sauce). This burger is a little different from what we get at mc donald's and kfc in a way that it is just grilled marinated chicken breast without any crispy batter coating. Other than that I felt everything on the menu is quite routine.

Raina,"Rated So after all the hype and hoopla, I finally managed to grab a bite at the globally loved Burger King. The first Burger King in India; the expectations from the supposedly biggest burger chain in the world were for obvious reasons, on the higher side. I ordered myself a mutton whopper(their signature speciality), accompanied by fries and a mango shake. Firstly, I must applaud them on their portions -the breakfast whopper kept me occupied well post lunch hours. The fries were crispy and golden and the shake, smooth and creamy without going on a sugar overdrive. Now for the main attraction. The whopper was massive, yes and quite generous on fresh tomatoes, onions and lettuce. The patty was meaty and flavourful too, but I would have liked a bit more spice to it and perhaps a little extra crunch too. I would like to go back there to try their sides that had a lot of interesting options, which my stomach couldn't accommodate then owing to the king size burger. The place gets brownie points for the smiling stafff and playing fantastic music as early as 10 am :)",Rated 3.0,12,37,??
Richa Moghe,"Rated A long pending review, it was way back in 2014 I visited Burger King in cp! So the thing is I have had this in the states too.

I had take a lunch break from work so had to quickly grab a meal with a friend and we chose this place. Wouldn't say was overwhelmed but the service could be improved a bit. Over all it was a good experience if I ignore the service aspect. The company made up for it.",Rated 3.5,25,137,??
Virus,"Rated Burger King - the self-proclaimed King of Burgers. Taking note from the success of Mcdonalds and KFC, Burger King too headed to India few months back, to give the people here a chance to taste something beyond the usual zingers and Mc Aloo Tikki Burgers. Since the day their first outlet opened in Delhi, my friends have kept badgering me for trying out this chain. Few days back, I finally decided to tick this off from my checklist. Thinking that it will be better to visit it on a weekday to avoid the weekend rush, landed here last wednesday. To my shock, it was just as packed as what I imagined it would be like on weekends. The outlet being partitioned into two sections, ambiance of the place is just like any other burger joint, nothing special to talk about. After waiting for 10 minutes and seeing that there are no chances of getting an empty table, we decided to opt for the take-away option. There were too many options to choose from and we decided to go for their Veg Burgers alongwith a couple of soft drinks. The Burgers were indeed King size, with a big aloo patty, cabbage, tomato, onion & cucumber as veggies and a combination of sauces in it. You will have to use both hands to hold it for sure. The quality and quantity was good and are enough to kill your hunger. But the disappointing thing was that it kept breaking off due to its size, thus arising the need of tissues as there are very high chances of things falling and spoiling your clothes. Overall I felt that the burgers felt quite pocket burning; maybe due to the low prices on which McD and KFC offer us their burgers. Although the size that Burger King offers is the one that you will not get anywhere else but the taste of it is quite similar to the Veg Burgers one can have at many other such Burger chains.",Rated 3.0,62,2218,??
Dr Ashwani Mehta,Rated Think as you mature (grow old) quality takes precedence over pocket friendliness. Wanted to try BK so tried Cp outlet as was nearby. Had their mutton double patty burger. Last time am going to have it. Nothing seemed right. Remembered all the juicy burgers at other restaurants. This was just a bun with meat with other ingredients who wanted a divorce from each other. No marriage of flavours. Remembered the way I used to like BK burgers in USA. Getting too old to have crap food I guess.,Rated 1.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Vandita_Roaming Gastronaut,"Rated This review has been long overdue. I recently found the lost pictures and now I feel right about posting a review. Food reviews without pictures seem incomplete to me. This feedback is about our takeaway order few months ago. We ordered a Veg whopper, BK Veggie burger along with fiery rings and veggie strips. The pricing of everything is pretty reasonable though. They are not trying to rip off the pockets of their customers on the pretext of their brand image which is commendable!...We were in a bit of a rush that day, so we quickly gobbled down the veggie burger since it is an easier to manage burger, with some cravers and soft drinks. Being a cheaper burger, BK didnt seem to have put their heart into making the veggie burger. It did not have the makings of a Burger King product. Tasted like any other veg burger at Mc Donalds which we all are sick of by now!! The fiery rings and veggie strips are amazing sides for burgers. Crispy, spicy, tasty and complete the unhealthy indulgent meal :P The whopper does live up to the expectations and hype. The buns are soft and the patty is moist and delicious with veggies in its dough. It is then loaded with cheese, lettuce, onions and awesome sauce. I tried the whopper on my second visit a couple months later while dining in at the outlet and it tasted better than the take-away order of course. I would recommend visiting just for the sake of their whopper burgers. The rest of the things on the menu would not meet high expectations. roaminggastronaut.wordpress.com",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Prabhakar Singh,"Rated Ooooh. Burger king is in town. After years of slobbing through the seemingly boring burgers from McDonalds we finally have it here. Burger king. The King of burgers. Which brings yet another series of boring burgers, albeit in a bigger size. After tearing through the crowd of Burger crazed people I really expected something amazing. A seat maybe. Its like eating in a metro during rush hour. This is mostly during the peak hours of ""whenever it is open"". Nothing more fun than that. Went for the mutton whopper. Mostly because chicken is done everywhere and I never actually jumped with joy there either. So cometh the whopper. Big. Nice (is in France). Looks good. Judging a book by the cover never was a good idea. There is a reason it got made into a saying. The bread was too soft. Almost limpy. Where do they keep it? Thank evolution for opposable thumbs. And was that mutton? If it was it didn't taste like it. Finishing the burger became a chore. I would have rather gone to work. Glad I had the fries and coke.

Bahar Gogia,"Rated Burger king Was on my list from a very long time. Finally, I went there yesterday with my friends at 6 Pm. The place was over crowded which was expected but still we managed to get seat within 15 mints. AMBIENCE is normal like any fast food joint with bright lights and good music. But I found the place a bit congested as the seating area was small. The whole interior was of Red color. Moving to FOOD, we ordered veg Combo meals : 1- Veg Chilli Cheese King combo which includes a veg chilli chesse burger, coke and fries. Veg chilli cheese burger was super Chessy and tasty but was spicy too. 2- BK veggie Double patty combo which includes a BK veggie burger, fries and Orange Frost Ice bolt. The burger was so yummy and filling. Totally loved the burger and Orange Frost was good too. 3- Kids combo which includes Veg burger,fries and Razberry Blue. The burger was crispy and tasty but the Razberry Ice bolt was too sweet in taste. The buns were very soft and fresh and patties were crispy too. SERVICE was quite nice. Also, the staff was very helpful as they helped us in getting a seat. VALUE FOR MONEY - Food is very economical here. My total bill was approx 500 bucks .

Karan!!!,"Rated Imagine this scenario where one company named McDonald's enjoys unprecedented & unparalleled success in the fast food industry with no competition whatsoever, well the Indians don't need to imagine this scenario as they have been living in this scenario for the past decade but not now due to the entry of the real burger king. Critics are gonna review Burger King mainly on their burgers which are fantastic for their price. The other items are however overlooked which is unfair to them. The French fries are awesome along with the fiery rings. The fries are unlike any other fries I've ever had. The burgers can be bought with the meal or singularly based on the preference of the customer as is the case with McDonald's. The place was congested with hoards of people coming in to eat with insufficient seating arrangement. They are going to enjoy success on par with McDonald's simply for the fact that the Indians have grown tired of visiting the same old outlet for the past decade to have burgers. Indians deserve varieties & the king is here to offer it to them.",Rated 3.5,80,82,??

Nandini Chauhan,Rated I was looking forward to try the whopper range of burger king after trying everything. But it doesn't really match up to the expectations.

Sagar Arora,"Rated My loved ones call me Burger Head and that describes me perfectly, for I love burgers. Though I know Burger King is a QSR and Ive had the chance of having some amazing burgers, I still had to give it a try. Burger King, Connaught Place, is a really busy outlet, so I wanted to decode the hype around Burger King India. FOOD: I tried Mutton Whooper and Chicken Whooper. I loved Mutton Whooper much more than the chicken one. Mutton Whooper is more tender and juicy and tastes amazing. The mutton patty has better flavor. Mirinda Ice Bolt is a really nice and refreshing cool drink. VERDICT: Burger King is a QSR, so obviously there is no comparison with gourmet food. Yet, the Mutton Whooper burger is a nice burger if you want to have a quick bite in budget.",Rated 3.5,30,552,??

So we decided to check into burger king at CP. the place was crowded at the counter but yeah that's something you gotta ignore in these well to do places....you see everyone wants a piece of them. So we opted for the chicken whopper jumbo and we clubbed it with the meal. The order definitely took them long but then again....it's Burger King man. The accommodation on the first floor was disappointing, borderline cramped up if I may say. However the food we were served definitely looked a lot and was a lot too. However the place was too noisy...a lot of staff indulged in unnecessary banter. The place too cramped. The food well the fries were disappointing the burger big but it kept breaking off due to its size. At the end of the meal we were definitely full but whether we ( friends and me), see ourselves visiting BK shortly I greatly doubt. But yeah go with your friends the place is definitely budget friendly and the next time I visit it...I 'll steer off the fries and opt for the mutton whopper. Happy Eating folks.",Rated 2.5,10,58,??

Nice BIG patty in the burger. Space issue as the place is crowded and you have to wait to get seats. The ambiance is a bit more than OK. The service surely is fast. You have many options here, I must say too many options and the most that I have ever seen at any outlet. The quality is Good. As you know I am vegetarian, so I tried the veg. whopper but I was with some friends and they took the Chicken Whopper and the Mutton Whopper and they also claimed that it was really good and they enjoyed eating, which they were unable to enjoy with other same burgers from different places. So I would say go there enjoy your meal. Do try the Whopper if you want to kill your hunger. Don't forget to take tissues (it is big enough to spoil your clothes). Cheers!!!",Rated 3.5,18,6,??

All basic things were there friendly staff , clean environment. Ordered BK burger. Took a bite it was good the patty was crispy made up of vegetables , corn and then took second bite and it feels like i have eaten this and it was reminding the taste of Mcd aloo tikki burger. Took a sip of orange frost and it was like Rasna, it was good. But full of ice as name is orange frost. Chocolate shake was also good. Veg Chilli cheese burger was also good.

Srijan Jhingan,"Rated I usually don't write reviews for any fast food franchise in general (because they're all the same and don't leave much to the imagination), but its Burger King. ... so here goes..:) The place opened up in the heart of Delhi quite some time back, but had the chance to finally try it out a few days back. Was in CP, so found it tempting to be a part of the hype that surrounded the joint since it opened up. After hearing and watching how people lined up to try the ""king of taste"", I was anything but surprised. The brand is new to Delhi, and it is pretty understandable that it will make heads roll. However, I will contradict popular belief by saying that Burger King is nothing great. It is just as ordinary of a joint as any other fast food franchise selling the same stuff, probably at lower prices. Friends told me that the food is to die for and that I'll beg for more.... so I put that to the test when I took the first bite off that Chicken whopper (mildly seasoned burger with some average veggies and a tasty mayo served over a nice, succulent and juicy grilled chicken patty). The Mutton whopper too was tasty (everything same except the obvious). The burger sizes were definitely something to behold with all wonder and glory......they are huge !! The prices are somewhat reasonable and you definitely don't feel cheated once you've had your fill. I'd say I really loved the stuff, but it's surely nothing to die for. But one thing's for sure, I am so coming back here to try out the other goodies the joint has to offer...:D.

After my trip to Dubai's Burger King that was just a step away from my hotel , I was very much excited about its entree in India . As soon as I entered this place , I saw a looooonnggg queu starting from the entree gate till the far away cash counter . But after waiting for 20 minutes or so I ordered one mutton whopper , a veg whopper for mum and a grilled chicken for my dad . I thought that mutton's taste would be quite similar to the beef ones that I had in Dubai but it wasn't . I still remember how juicy the beef burgers were back there and this mutton patty looked and tasted like it was totally dehydrated . The veg whopper was good and tasted a bit better than the Dunkin's veg burger . I was really very dissatisfied by seeing the size of my dad's grilled chicken burger . It was almost the same size as mcaloo tiki burger but costed almost same as the whopper . I also tried the 180 degree that tasted milky and was not according to my taste. I also felt that the icy mirrinda thing was useless. On a round up I just feel that this chain isn't the same as it is around the world . The only thing that I reccomend is chicken and veg whoppers .",Rated 3.0,20,111,??

Although the entrance is on the smaller side,the interior,divided into two levels is quite spacious.The seating arrangements are decent.The ambience was quite typical of a fast food joint and it was quite neat and clean on the whole. Coming to the food,I got for myself a Mutton Whopper and my friend got a grill chicken burger with double patty.The Mutton whopper was good and yes quite huge too but not really worth all the hype.Though it was nice but I must say I have had better burgers.I liked the smokiness in the patty.The double patty grill chicken burger was just about average.The fries were okay.The service was swift and the prices moderate. Overall I felt the lack of beef and pork in the menu was rather too evident.Although my experience was decent,it was no way near the king burgers I had previously.",Rated 3.5,278,1596,??

Nitin Manapure,"Rated Burger is a very popular restaurant chain in foreign countries. It's first restaurant in India at the Connaught Place was nothing more than a gem for delhites. I was lucky to visit this place on the opening day itself. My experience was awesome only. I had their both vegetarian and non vegetarian menu. I was pretty impressed by the taste of beg burgers. But their non-veg burgers were simply pathetic and a waste of money. It had no taste and were just pale in comparison to the burgers served by McDonald's or KFC. Hope they improve their non-veg menu soon. Though burger king is positioning is of premium fast food chain, irony was that there was nothing premium about it. They should also justify the high price of their burgers. Not at all any healthy content and simply low in value. Their offering in terms of drinks and ice cream is just the copy of McDonald's only. So anybody who goes to this place would go for just trying their menu for once and definitely not as a regular customers. Hope they do something about it.",Rated 3.0,2,16,??

I ordered a double patty mutton burger, the patty was pretty average and you would definitely would have had better if you are fond of burgers. The fries are pretty average too and I was thoroughly disappointed.

Once it opened I could not wait to give it a shot and like everybody else, compare it to McDonalds. Burger King was a huge let down in every way. There wasn't a single aspect that stood out or anything else that made me want to come back to that place. I visited Burger King on New year's day and it couldn't have been more crowded. The queue literally was out of the store onto the road outside. Despite that a lot like me continued to wait for the apparent heaven that had descended from the west finally. None of the burgers were in anyway creative or innovative. They were the same old burgers that we have been eating at our other favourite food chain all these years.

The long line for burgers is definitely not proportional to the taste and quality of the chain. We ordered a chicken tandoor grill after much discussion,both a combo. It costed us around 450. Hungry as we were,we literally were getting ready to hog on our burgers.But then we got a reality check after the first glance.I have had burgers which were bigger,better and much more cheaper than what we were given.(The most popular food chain,I guess it would be stupid to mention that). So the buns were like as they were pressed below a trunk or something, the chicken thigh in the mint chutney was the only saving grace.But for the price,I'd like more,definitely more.

Now the Fiery Rings are a must try and ask for a Shot Of Mayonnaise as it is quintessential for the Rings and adds an extra dimension to the taste. The Rings on their own also taste great.

I ordered 1 combo, 1 crispy veg, 1 blueberry frost, and the show stopper 4 VEG STRIPS with their so called special sause. Firstly the Onion in the Crispy Veg Burger were like the left outs of the onion chopps and had the barks of its outer covering. We thought it might had happened by mistake so we ignored it. Next came the Show Stopper.. the GREAT VEG STRIPS. the first 2 VEG STRIPS were OK... then when i ate the 3rd one. I HAD A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT KIND OF SMELL AND TASTE WITH NO CORNS OR PEAS IN IT WHICH THEY USUALLY SERVE IN VEG STRIPS.

She said "" Sir, ye cheese hai, dekhiye isme ye aloo be hai ."" and took away the veg strips box. She asked me to wait..but i was felt like vomiting, so I left the place and will NEVER VISIT AGAIN.

Veg whooper was similar to other chains like mcds and nothing new ..but ofcourse the veggies used were fresh and buns were soft and tasty. Chicken whooper was THE BEST burger i had till date..so huge so yummy and a delight for the souls of chicken lovers and the BK grill chicken burger was a miniature version of the Whooper. Chicken nuggets were BAD and we somehow managed to finish just the 4 pieces of it. The taste was foul and disappointed me. 180 degrees was creamy and crunchy because of crushed gems.. it was nice Other attraction of this place was if regular burger were so big and filling what are the king size like..

We tried the icetea, hot chocolate, veg chilli cheese burger, and the spicy bean royale.

Luckily we got a some space to seat which was not seeming possible by looking at the first go. Nice Ambience. Well attended by the waiters. Taste was how a normal burger would taste like. Reasonable cost. Chances are that It may give competition to McDonalds but only in long run and if it suitably adapts to Indian Eaters. As part of their promotion I liked the Paper Crown they were giving to all customers. Good idea. Cheers! P.S- It is too crowded most of the times partly due to location and partly due to the food.

Prateek Bohra,"Rated Burger King! Finally!!!! If you have had enough of Mc'D for a decade and you cannot take the bee swams and derogatory quality of it then its time to switch to a premium, fresh and tasty QSR. Opening its doors to India, BK caught a lot of attention with people queing up outside in the initial days! Even on the day I went to BK, it was 26th Jan and outlets in CP were opening up by the afternoon. BK too was preparing itself with semi closed shutters and a long que of people outside. The outlet is located in the inner circle and has a ground and mezzanine floor to it. Space can always be a constraint for such immensely popular food joints on busy Sundays and other holidays. Yet, Burger King has sufficient sitting in both levels with comfortable sofa(cushioned) setting. Comparing it to Mc'D, which has granite table tops and light wooden chairs. A vegetarian whooper was the obvious choice alongwith fries and a cold drink. The whooper is really whooping in size! The buns extra soft, the patty extra hot and juicy. It has the right amount of vegetables (tomato, lettuce, onions) to make it a standard Quick Burger! What made me a fan of BK was the detailing with which the patty/tikki was made.. Large in size, stuffed with lot of veggies..I spotted peas, corn and traces of carrot in it, making it a real Veggie delight. People who go with high expectations may be a little disappointed since they would be expecting a Fork You or Chilli's delight at a price slightly above Mc'D or KFC!! Not a justice here!

Give us softer, fresher buns, better fries, more variety of beverages (yes, more hot beverages), mutton burgers, more than one kind of appetizers (for how long shall i just be content with ""hot wings"") and the word ""whopper"", and I might just recant this poorly written, inexperienced review.

I also tried the chilli cheese combo , the burger is different a little spicy but cheesy. The ice cream here i didnot like it that much. So go for mcD's choco dip softly. I have to say the staff here is really nice and helpful. In a hurry i forgot to take my choco dip and threw my bill but the staff checked it and kindly remind me to claim it.

Amar Arjun,"Rated OVERHYPED is the word that comes to my mind after i visited the CP outlet of BURGER KING. Initially, i had planned to visit the Saket outlet but after reading how chaotic it was and the frenzy the people had, i decided against it. So, finally after multiple outlets opened, i decided to visit the CP outlet because everything tastes and feels better at CP :P . It is located E block and is a very small outlet indeed, the biggest problem being that the shop is quite narrow and it is literally impossible to find yourself a seat. We ordered 2 CHICKEN TANDOOR GRILL and a CHICKEN WHOOPER. The service was quite quick and we were served our burgers within 5 mins. We were forced to take it outside as it seemed that the place was about to explode of the no. of people that were crammed there. Coming to the burgers, the WHOOPER was a disappointment , it had the size but it lacked the flavors and the patty was dry as if all the juices had been sucked out. On the other hands, the CHICKEN TANDOOR GRILL was quite a revelation as they have successfully combined the all time fav TANDOORI CHICKEN into a burger and the sauce works well with it, but the size of the burger is quite small and when you pay more , you expect more and hence it disappoints at that front! It would amazing if they could give whooper's size to the tandoor grill. Until then, i might not visit it again. P.S: The bun quality was quite good.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

I went hoping it would be an improvement over McDonalds, and i was right :) In CP berger king is located just near the metro station. It was crowd like anything... We had to wait like 15 mins outside :| after entering we had a hard time finding a table to sit. One thing was clear, its not a place to hangout for long. When they have as many stores as McDonald's have maybe then we will. Coming to the food... Its Whopper berger is everything you asked for. Simply splendid. The veg items are new and a change over the McDonald's. The nonveg is superior though. Pricing is excellent and competitive. If you are looking for a lot of options and have some change to throw... This is The place. The 180 ice cream is superb. I also had the shakes and it was just soothing. :) The few cons lie in their fries... The french fries of McDonald's are better.

Good-work guys! My friends and I had a regular Paneer King melt burger meal annddd it was amaaazing! The patty had a different taste altogether infused with seasoning and flavour till the last bite.

Kritin Kapoor,"Rated So after letting the initial rush and hype die down, I decided to check out the Indianised version of this international chain. LOCATION AND APPROACH (4.5/5) It's located in the Inner Circle CP, what do you expect? Easy to get there, easy to leave. Lotsa parking all around. It's located in a corner though so you might not be able to spot it at a first glance. AMBIENCE (3.5/5) It has all the regulars of a fast food chain. Music, bright lighting, and lots of tables crammed into a small place. This equates to lots of people meaning it's going to be a bit loud. Imagine your local McDonald's, it's the same. Colour schemes om the walls are bright though. Makes you feel right at home. I wouldn't suggest staying for long at this place during rush hour due to the hectic image it can take shape of. But otherwise, it's a good place to go to for a quick bite. FOOD (3.5/5) So I tried their Chicken Whopper, Tandoori Burger, Spicy Chicken Royale, Fries, & Coke. The Whopper was good. Spicy chicken was same as a McDonald's Spicy Chicken Burger. No difference. The Tandoori Grill Burger was surprisingly nice. Many restaurants have failed to incorporate Tandoori tastes with their cuisines, but a few like Subway, BYD, and now Burger King have succeeded. I'd suggest trying this one out. It'll help satiate your need for Indian food as well as eating at a Fast Food chain. SERVICE (4/5) Their service was fast. Considering the fact that it was more or less full on a Wednesday afternoon, they handled their service and the amount of customers professionally. No issues here. UNIQUE TO THIS PLACE Right now? I'd say try the Tandoori Burger. This might change when I revisit to try other burgers of theirs. CONCLUSION (4/5) Recommended if you're tired of other fast food chains.",Rated 4.0,34,266,??

This visit was much more special as I tried many more delicacies and there was more seating capacity here unlike saket's outlet. For vegetarians, you should grab a Whooper without thinking anything. Ice bolts by mirinda was good as well. 180 degree is similar to Mcflurry which is served in McDonald's. You should also try their exciting range of shakes, the one thing which makes them special is the less quantity of milk in it.

We ordered 8pcs of veg chilli cheezos , Bk grill chicken and a chicken spicy royale. Veg chilli Cheezos are pure ecstasy, they are just perfect with the hot melting cheese with a hint of oregano seasoning. The sweet chilli sauce they gave with it wasnt enough for eight pieces and I had to buy another one. The chicken Royale was delectable,a long well baked bun with mayo , lettuce and a heavenly chicken patty. The BK chicken grill was nothing compared to Chicken Royale , merely a filler , patty reminded me of Chicken Mcgrill and the only good thing about this burger was the mint mayo.

French fries they were in the combo with the whooper burger . it was regular combo . quantity was normal and taste was like same as that of mcdonalds . combo also included one cold drink . i seriously want to tell you foodie's that its not at at all costly and their quantity is huge ( i am talking about whooper don't know about other burger's). i felt like my money was well spent.",Rated 4.0,55,35,??

One of the first things that struck me was the fact that it was real easy to find a place to sit and have the meal, now, i am not sure if this is a good or not so good thing overall. Positives: the sizes were big, bun seems fresh, mutton burger was a first of its kind and the burgers were juicy, unlike KFC n McD where it seems quite dry. Value for money. Negatives: not something which was WOW and was being missed. It was like a regular burger joint with a new competition coming in. If all the three burger joints are together. It wont be like people rushing to only this and abandon the others.

Though it's all time crowded when they open there first outlet in Saket , but the waiting in the queue is worth it, They have lot of options to chose from, even for side dishes, I love each of them, The nuggets being my favorite, they charge Rs.50 for four piece and they even have onion rings, vegetable strip, available for decent price and it is so yummy. After Saket we tried there outlet in CP , located in inner circle , Charm of Burger was same here also , people are eagerly waiting for there placed orders , we ordered French fries , Chicken , Mutton Whoppers , paneer king Melt and Shakes. Their french fries I feel are on a thicker end as compared to same level of restaurant with balance seasoning . The burger's are different and quite tummy filling as well. Chicken Whopper, they are AMAZING. I was not able to eat the whole burger but every bite made me say ""Ummm.. Yumm.. this is awesome"" There even MUTTON was so delicious and the taste is so smoky and grilled. Love it! The quantity of lettuce leaf and the mayo are so satisfying to see. I don't find there paneer king melt so interesting , may be due to my personal taste , but my fellows like it lot. Beverages were also smooth and refreshing , love the place lot and recommended to burger lovers.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Isha Saxena,"Rated After taking down the Saket outlet and gorging on the widely advertised whopper burgers, we decided to give the CP outlet a go to try other things on their menu. The outlet finds itself, spread over two floors. The place is smaller than the Saket one but just as much occupied with exuberant foodies chatting and chomping their way through the new burgers on the block. After scanning the top floor we decided to make our order a takeaway when we got a table. We ordered 8pcs of veg chilli cheezos which we had absolutely loved last time, a chicken spicy royale and a Bk grill chicken. The service was intantaneous! Gorging on the veg chilli cheezos again was pure bliss. The crusty outside and the piping hot insides with a strong oregano flavour which is absolutely tantalizing! The bk grill chicken burger was a bummer. Liliputian in comparision to the Whopper burgers and much less enticing, the sesame seed bun looked rather like McDonald's. However, the patty was juicy and appetizing, seasoned with mint mayonnaise made the burger barely decent. However the spicy chicken royale was delectable. Sesame seed freckled hot dog buns laced with lettuce, luscious mayo and a thick crispy chicken patty. A very piquant preparation. They are expanding like wild fire and I can't wait to try more things from the menu! :) chompslurrpburp.wordpress.com",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Answer is NO.Their burgers are fine alright but nothing special really.They are just same as burgers at McD. Even I found their burgers very dry with minimal toppings. I found Dunkin donuts 's burger much better than this. I wont mind grabbing a burger from this place while on go but definitely not a place i will plan to visit with friends or family.

I ordered chicken whooper their signature dish and in simple words i hated it. You will only get the taste of the tomato sauce been spread upon the whooper piece. The whooper placed in it only has mild flavors of chicken in it. Being though a big size of a burger, the wow factor was missing. The outlet had that pumping crowd.

You'll always find long queues here, but the good thing is that the staff is hard working and you'll get your order within minutes. This time I tried their Chicken Tandoor Grill . This is by far the best burger I've tried. The juicy grilled chicken patty was fresh and grilled just right. I actually liked it more than the whoppers. Do give it a try, it won't disappoint you. :)",Rated 3.5,15,210,??
Bhavul Gauri,"Rated In two words : nothing special. This review comes from a veggie. We ordered chilli chees and paneer melt king, both king size. Service is fast, once you reach the counter. First disappointment was the size.... Only zhooper is huge in size, even though chilli cheese and paneer melt costs the same. Zhooper is nothing so good in taste. Paneer melt is better and chilli cheese is probably the best they serve in veg. Fiery rings (onion rings) is not something you'd like to order. They're worse than what you get at BluO, Ambience, Gurgaon. Fries were good, better then McD and KFC. And, it's not heavily priced either..... But, the crowd and suffocating environment with just average or above average meal won't make your day. It's overhyped. Being honest here. Patties are grilled properly, which is good, but still, people rush in like there's a 90% off inside. And, then it doesn't meet the expectations. Shakes are really thick. My friends didn't like them too much due to the same reason. Still, if you really love burgers, go and try it once. Preferably on a weekday afternoon.",Rated 2.5,10,212,??

I placed an order for two veg whoppers and one hot chocolate ... Order came around 500 bucks I placed for double patty and they were awesome ... Filled my stomach and was better than McD ...

Sanchita Abrol,"Rated Went to Burger King yesterday with friends to check the place out. Like I already had read the reviews before going there, there is always a crowd at this little place. Got no place to sit so I had to finish my burger on the street like my friends did. Being a vegetarian what I ordered was Paneer King Burger and a hot chocolate. The burger was not what it looked like in the menu at all and I was shocked there for a second thinking they might have switched my order but that wasnt so!! There was no paneer..! The fine part was that the burger was tasty but not done. This is the ONLY reason why I have given a 3 to the joint. The hot chocolate was quite ordinary. Nothing special at all. :/ My overall experience was not so happening but i might visit there to check out other Burgers. Hopefully this time, will get a place to sit inside.",Rated 3.0,24,23,??

Astha Srivastava,"Rated So much hype, so many expectations, all in vain. When I went into Burger King today, I thought it would be a burger experience beyond comparison, something different and someting great. My friend Shourya Gupta ordered a Chicken Tandoori Grill combo and I ordered a Mutton Whopper combo and our bill was 500 bucks, which was okay. ALSO, they had a 20 minute waiting, which was expected but not not welcomed on a hungary stomach. The Chicken Tandoori Grill was good, exactly like putting a grilled piece of chicken between 2 bread buns. The surprising thing was that they had decided not to put any veggies (besides onions) in the burger, so it didn't feel like a 'burger', really (not a good thing: we wanted to eat Burgers at BURGER King). But this was probably the best thing on the plate. The Mutton Whopper was a very huge, very average burger. Nothing that I'd come to BK again for. Another good thing was that their coke had no ice and the glass was completely full. The fries were really not up to the mark. Thick, not even crispy. My tummy was completely full but my heart had broken, and I went to Dunkin disappointed. It was a sad day for a burger lover like me.",Rated 3.0,14,109,??

The moment i entered it, i had a much despicable experience; too much rush at service counter! It felt like Metro train all over again. Our expectations raised as we saw more customers in comparison to KFC and MCdonalds. I got my chance to order after 15 mins of queue wait. I ordered 3 crispy chickens without combo, 12 pieces veggie strips, 1 paneer king combo, 1 chicken tandoor grill combo & 2 chocolate BK Sundaes to kill hunger of 3 atleast 5'8 & 75kg human beings :). Service was almost instant and i received my order within 3-4 minutes. Burger King lived up to its 'King' reputation as all burgers were juicy, fresh and a pleasure to eat. The ""Haasil-e-Mehfil"" was paneer king and is a must try for every visit. Only downside was Veggie strips and was somehow understandable by its more piece/rate comparison. I absolutely love veg strips (courtesy KFC). My sisters enjoyed our fast food themed dinner inside Burger King as much as i did. It's now added to my ""Eat awesome fast food"" collection!

With high hopes, i had been waiting for this food chain to enter the indian market but all in vain. The food is cheap, that's ok but the level of food is even cheaper. A chicken Wooper, allright, horrible chicken patties, burnt! with what? Onions and tomatoes? Seriously? That's all one expects and can expect from an international well known food chain like burger king? The staff was kind enough to change the burnt burger for me but the new burger they give in exchange, turns out to be the same burnt thing again! The cheesey nuggets we took, were an average and the chilly ketchup, bad! Bad experience, horrible food, no taste, not at all recommend. Go to McDonalds instead, i am not a McD lover either but I would prefer McD over Burger king any day! Burger king, no good!",Rated 1.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Anirudh Khanna,"Rated This was something on my check list for long, and finally I got a chance to dig in. It is definitely overrated. I had the mutton whopper, which, I must say, is the most filling burger you'd find in any burger place. The mutton patty isn't much thick though. It was good but I had higher expectations. The other burgers were similar in taste to McDonald's. I, surprisingly liked the fries a lot- thicker and very different from the regular ones. I'd say go to BK with low expectations. It is soon going to be like just another fast food chain.",Rated 3.5,114,219,??

Prateek Guddoo,"Rated Well! As the 3rd largest burger restraunt chain has finally come to India, I thought of giving it a try. The Burger King at Cannaught Place has quite less room space but even that din't stop people from waiting for a seat or even eating while satnding. I ordered a Chicken Whooper combo meal king size( which is like a large at McDonalds) which had a burger(literally king size) fries and a large pepsi. Well the burger was good not exceptional although mutton whooper was a lil better than mine which my friend had ordered, but budget wise a big thumbs up! The king size whooper meal cost me jus 250 bucks..much cheaper than McD or KFC and it filled me up completely also its grilled chicken burger is totally awesome unlike the chicken Mcgrill at Mcdonalds which is just like a 3 bite burger. So I would highly recomend BK,with something new in town ,cheap and good meal combos and appetizing burgers!",Rated 3.5,5,39,??
Bhuvan Singh,"Rated Guys please don't mistake Burger King with Rajiv Chowk metro station due the long lines you will witness here at the cash counter lol. It was Saturday and the place was loaded with people and that got me really excited. We ordered veg and chicken whopper, cheese chilli cheezos and onion rings. Surprisingly the best item out of all this were the onion rings. Cheezos were horrible as i was expecting nice and warm running cheese inside but it was cold and not very enjoyable. I liked the angry sauce they give with both these items. Chicken whooper was bland and had no taste at all. Finished it after a lot of effort and the veg whopper was just like a veg zinger you get at KFC. Only positive was that the burgers were big in size but honestly what's the benefit of it when there is no taste. So much hype but sadly it has disappointed me and i will prefer going to kfc the next time.",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
SHANKARA RAMAN,"Rated OK OK OK..... The Big Daddy of Burgers is here... So all the McD / KFC burger fans - get ready to be blown away by the sheer awesomeness of the Burgers. And please for Heaven's sake, learn from them ""How to make a good burger"" or handover your outlets to them, helping them for easy expansion. Ok enough venting....BK - Burger King...I had played and finished Grand Theft Auto Sanandreas Video game and since then I have been waiting for Burger King to Open. I got the news from a friend on a friday and I was there at the outlet on both saturday and sunday. Taste:- Please forget whatever you know about the taste of burgers an Just have the SPICY CHICKEN ROYALE an CHICKEN WHOPPER...I mean the mayo, the sauce and the Chicken - Yum Yum and Yum...So juicy and it's for sure that you'll feel, taste and relish that Chicken in your first bite....And all this won't burn your pocket toooo....Go for the KING SIZE COMBOS - Large Fries + Large Pepsi @ extra Rs.100... I also had CHICKEN CHILLI CHEESE - It was good tasty burger but small and ain't worth for the price... And then My All time favorite - The FIERY RINGS (American Onion Rings)....Awesome taste and just the feeling of the Onion along with the american mustard inside, just smack-dabs my mind.....12 Pieces for 99 - You've got to be kidding me....Even the Roadside Raedi-walas wont give 12 piece of Onion Pakoda for 100.... Deserts - I loved both the 180 DEGREES (OREO and GEMS (personal favorite)). I also was awestruck to see that the ICE-BOLTS were only priced at Rs.25...I mean what the hell - Minute Maid is priced at Rs.35.... Only Downer - This is gonna stay for some months only though - is the lack of space to sit and have these delicacies...Being a new and obviously famous outlet and also situated just below E-Block ""MY BAR"" (another local Landmark), it's attracting a lot of crowd now, you'll have to wait for 20 minutes to order and then another 10 minutes to get the order. It would be a little bit embarrassing for some as people would be standing and looking at u eating while gawking for the seat....My Suggestion is Order a take-away and sit in your car or somewhere in CP and happily enjoy the food along with the winters... Must Haves - CHICKEN WHOPPER, FIERY RINGS, SPICY CHICKEN ROYALE, 180 GEMS, ICE BOLTS.... After reading some other reviews, I've noticed that people are saying Veg-Whopper is same as McVeggie, just bigger. I just want them to show a different ""VEG"" Burger from any outlet in India...Veg Burger means having VEG CUTLET in between the BUNS - thats it...

We orderd the Chilli Cheese Chicken and Veg Whopper -- both were average -- and in fact, the chilli cheese burger is much smaller than what it appears to be in the menu photos. Don't go for it.

Firey rings and chilli cheezos were f9, but veg strips were gud but still not better than KFC but price is much less.

One thing they don't have cold coffee huh! how how it could be. Update: Now i have visited their restaurant and tried almost all the burgers. My final verdict would be avoid cp otlet and go to others bcoz u cant sit and enjoy ur meal, u can opt for nehru place.

Indeed, BK has won hearts! I tried chicken whopper again with blueberry blue Ice bolt. The whopper was the same. Maybe this time I felt te chicken flavor much more. Good thing they removed the onion. Overall it was a fine balance. The blue ice bolt was ok. Sometimes it felt like flavoured ice water. Didn't like much.

Monil Singhal,"Rated Anyone who was around Central Delhi/Connaught Place in the past two days would have seen people walking around with a golden Burger King crown. After the huge hype and success in Saket, Burger King opened its second outlet in CP a couple of days ago and has been attracting a huge crown (thankfully the queues are way smaller though). Burger King, a global chain of burgers and fast food based in USA, is popular world wide and needs no introduction. The excitement surrounding its launch in India was no surprise and I couldn't wait to try it out! A few visits later, I feel that BK has done a decent job of living up to the expectations. The place is just like a McDonalds or KFC, with a bunch of counters, self service and similar pricing. The range of burgers however, is slightly larger (at least compared to KFC). I have tried the following - Chicken Whooper, BK Grill Chicken, Crispy Chicken, Spicy Chicken Royale and Veg Chilli Cheese Burgers and the Fiery Rings. The chicken burgers are quite good, typically with a lean patty but its all chicken, nothing mixed in (unlike McDonalds). Also, it is a proper chicken patty rather than a fried chicken piece in KFC. I didn't really like the BK Chicken Grill since the sauce was too minty. The Crispy Chicken was alright, but good considering the price range. The Spicy Chicken Royale was more like a sub, delicious and my favourite out of those I have tried. The whooper, the flagship item of BK, was huge, juicy (though the patty was leaner compared to others) and tasty. The Vegetarian burger though decent, fails in comparison to KFC etc in my opinion. The same applies to Fiery Rings, which failed to impress. But overall, a good range, decent prices and good burgers, specially for non vegetarians (Also, its the first out of KFC, McDonalds etc to introduce a mutton burger)!",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

In terms of food we ordered Chicken Tandoori Grill Burger, a Chicken Whopper Meal (which had French fries and coke), and two hot lattes. The food was good undoubtedly but was nothing extra ordinary which would leave us craving for more. The burgers tasted like what we have had before and the French fries were average as well. But that said its still an enjoyable experience to hang out with friends and have American fast food. Is it worth it? If you are going solely for the food, than you might be in for a disappointment as its nothing extra ordinary, but with a good company, you may enjoy some moments.",Rated 3.5,31,90,??

Parth,"Rated Since this outlet has just opened, it would be unfair to comment on the ambience. Right now its pretty loud and chaotic and bursting with people but I'm sure things will settle down as the novelty wears off. The staff was pretty friendly and the service was fast. As for the food, I had the spicy chicken royale which was average taste wise (sort of tasted like kfc's zinger burger). The burger was definitely bigger than what you get at McDonalds for the same price. Tl;dr : the place was crowded, the staff was friendly and the food didn't suck.",Rated 3.5,6,1,??
Catherine,"Rated Yesterday was opening nite for Burger King in C.P. Unlike City-walk everyone was allowed inside the place. It was like one big party with almost everyone donning paper crowns. Though the outlet was overcrowded, people were quite politely waiting for their orders. Service was fast, as in 3-4 minutes the order was served at the counter with many takeaways as seating was obviously rare. I tried out the Crispy Chicken stunner which was quite crunchy and tasty. Their trademark Mutton Whopper burger was large in size but quite good. Though the mutton patty was not crisply done when compared to the chicken one, the burger was good compared to other such mutton burgers. Both the burgers were filled with white colored cream which was finger licking but probably full of calories. The chicken chilli cheezos were also quite yummy and spicy. I suppose once the hype and rush settles down; it would a good place to hang out.",Rated 3.5,50,647,??
Foodddzilllaaa,"Rated Okay . So finally we have burger king in India. The most awaited fast food brand opening it's second outlet in connaught place. Went on the first day of opening, was really amazed to see that there was no huge que for entering the restro. It was as normal as a walk in order. I ordered a tandoor chicken burger, a chicken whopper combo with the freeze mirinda blue. The burgers are were really good , the tandoori chicken burger was the best . The whopper burger was so huge that maybe some people with low appettite wont be able to eat that one burger. It was really good too. The blue freeze mirinda was too sweet and very bad in taste. Although i had a good experience visiting the burger king , as i was really excited to visit the India's outlet. The brand lives upto its name and serves good at really economical prices .",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Awini Ambuj Shanker,"Rated I tried the Mutton Whopper and it was quite nice. nothing exceptional, nor anywhere as good as the burgers they serve abroad, but definitely better than the mutton burger from Dunkin Donuts. the burger is much bigger than what we are used to in India, the patty was nicely char grilled but was much thinner than I expected, and was slightly chewy at one end. they use too much lettuce, maybe to cut cost and make the burger look bigger. instead i wish they would put in an extra slice or two of tomatoes to enhance the flavour of the meat. i would order it again, but will have to keep my own mustard and ketchup at hand!",Rated 3.5,16,57,??
