Drishti Ohri,"Rated Gone are the days when this place was just for dosas... With changing time, it has emerged out as an equally amazing place for tamilian curries, desi drinks like the buttermilk and super yummy onion ravan masala dosa... For everyone out there, the showstopper is a plate of mini idly with ghee topped on it.",Rated 4.5,2,37,??
Gunjan Rathi,Rated This is my favourite south indian food restaurant. They have amazing dosas and their chutneys. I like the way they make their sambhar. It has the perfect tangy flavour.,Rated 4.5,22,10,??

Nishant Chandra Lal,"Rated A great family place in CP. Once you visit this place it will become you favorite place for South indian food . Easy location . Although you can have to wait for sometime as they are completely occupied if you are visiting on night hours(7-9) on Weekend . But once you will enter you won't regret for waiting .We ordered Rava Masala dosa , Upma and Tamil Nadu Fixed thali . Dosa was very crisp and stuff was filled in good quantity .

Vanisha Ahuja,Rated Authentic South Indian can definitely be found here. Must go for South Indian lover. The South Indian sweet dish are pretty good. Different from the regular ones,Rated 4.0,2,47,??
Akshat Nain,"Rated Went their with my family. The seating is average and approach a little congested (that is why I deducted .5 from the rating). We ordered the Masala dosa, rava dosa, onion dosa, rava khichdi, rava kesari (it is basically suji halwa with kesar in it) and an ice cream (We had kids with us). The dosas were crisp and had appropriate amount of filling; the onion dosa was specially good. Rava khichdi was the best thing. Suji halwa was not something out of the world, but a good thing to have as a dessert in a cold evening. It was dripping with ghee and had a good consistency (properly cooked). Excellent family place to hangout with. Reasonably priced. A little on the costlier side for this type of cuisine for bachelors and students.",Rated 4.5,21,152,??
Foodholic,Rated So visited this place with my mother because she wanted to visit this places since as long as I remember . we both are really fond of south Indian food and saravana bhavan is a place for people like us. Really nice food my mom loved the upma and the filter coffee. The service was really fast and we were lucky enough to get the seats without waiting :). So if you love South Indian food and even if you don't sarvana bhavan is a must try.,Rated 4.5,9,0,??
Divya Gopakumar,"Rated I want to know who are those people who brought down the rating of such a fine place to 4.4!! These guys deserve a 5 hands down!! I am crazy about their Sambhar Rice. And hey they serve it only till 3.30 pm so you better hurry! And then Ghee Roast Masala- yummmmm!! And wait- did I mention Dahi Vada- oh what taste! Don't keep reading- rush to Saravana. And even if you find a loooong waiting, please wait as it is totally worth it :)",Rated 5.0,45,88,??
Mallika Fatehpuria,Rated I've been wanting to go to this place for the longest time and hence went with a lot of expectations. My friend and I went at 4 pm and were asked to wait for 5 minutes. In those 5 minutes of waiting time no one left the restaurant and we were given the table. I think they like to create the whole waiting for a table aura. We ordered for the ghee paper sada dosa and ghee sada dosa. My friend had also ordered for a filter coffee. When our order came the server mixed it up and we had to figure it out on our own. The filter coffee came after telling the server at least 10 times about it. They were least interested and quite lackadaisical at their work. It was a good experience but wasn't too impressed overall.,Rated 4.0,75,293,??
Abhay Bhatia,Rated Service 5/5 Food quality 4/5 Taste 3.5 /5 Ambience 4/5 Overall experience was ok. Sambhar was delicious but the bad part about it is they serve very limited portion of it. Food taste is ok not very outstanding.,Rated 3.5,7,0,??

Natasha Ahuja,Rated Saravana Bhavan is a perfect place to have south indian food. It is located at the outer circle and is quite easy to locate. Occupying two floor this restaurant is always crowded especially during night time. Dahi Wada is highly recommended at this place. Wada soaked in sweet and fresh dahi with topped with boondhi makes the perfect breakfast. Wada and Idli were good too. The chutneys that they were served with are really good too. Onion Rava Masala and Upma were the best. Upma was quite heavy and also had dry fruits in it. On the whole this is a perfect to have south indian food.,Rated 4.0,31,226,??

Asit Saha,"Rated Of all the Saravana Bhavans in Delhi, this one is probably the best and the one at Karolbagh the worst. I love their Ghee Pongal which is no less delectable than a risotto. The fragrance of zeera and kali mirch with ghee makes it a mouth-watering delicacy. Ditto for the mini lunch spread which I am unable to finish off ever.

Vidhi Malik,"Rated Was looking for a budgety dinner place in cp and figured out this one through zomato only. It's a simple decent place with carnatic music playing. Well, the home made savories mentioned in the menu were new to me, did not found them in other south Indian restaurants, however, I did not try them yet. We ordered butter masala dosa n rice idli and found both dishes good (just good), the Chatnnis were really really less in quantity and you will surely have to order an extra serving (which is chargeable). Overall just found the place okayish but pocket friendly for sure. And yes, do have a look at paper they give you to keep under your plate and I was amazed to see the number of branches they have all over the world.",Rated 3.5,46,74,??
Asim Behera,"Rated I may not be the best person to review this as I don't care too much for this genre of food, however this is based on my wife's input; she loves this genre.

Rahul Rajeshwar Gupta,"Rated I've been to the place countless times and each and every time I leave the place highly satisfied. The food on offer is completely south Indian and pure veg. There is a huge variety on offer along with some freshly squeezed juices. It is very difficult to pin point any one dish but do not miss the amazing badam halva. One thing that you might notice about the place after you have tried a few dishes is that unlike most of the places, every fish that this place offers is meticulously prepared and equally tasty, and surprisingly no exceptions. The staff too is warm and knowledgeable. However you might want to avoid the place on weekends due to the huge que. Overall : A MUST TRY PLACE FOR EVERY VEGETARIAN!!",Rated 4.5,46,136,??
Rajat Dua,Rated Went with family couple of times and it is great in terms of taste And menu. Service at CP one needs to be looked at as you need to search and call the order taker. Janpath one is good in all the aspects,Rated 4.0,27,59,??

I thought of it as a joke and just made fun of him by saying haldiram also got outlets abroad. After a year or so,i saw this outlet in cp i found something familiar about it.so me n my friend went in we ordered rawa dosa and idly. Man!! That was the best south indian food i have ever eaten. I remebered about that freind the fact that he mentioned about this place and i ignored it for so lonng. Thanks mallu friend.",Rated 4.0,16,22,??
Bhawna Satija,"Rated Saravana Bhavan is all about mouth watering South Indian food which offers an elaborate menu across sections! They serve really impressive food. Colorful idlis with chutney and sambhar, SB gets it just right everytime you pay a visit to CP. Moreover, it breaks all stereotypes with its north-indian styles dosas - vegetable dosa being my favourite - and delicious sundaes. Choco Cherry Jubilee is highly recommended for all ice-cream fans! The large number of people waiting to get a table on all days of the week testifies its popularity, when multiple outlets are opening day in and out in the heart of the city. Pocket friendly with a wonderful service and simple yet elegant ambiance, here's where you should head when you're craving some southern spice!",Rated 4.0,21,333,??
Sachin Gupta,Rated Went there with my friend...had to wait a little...the waiter served some water...in steel pyaalis...a thin layer of oil was floating on top of water...we ordered a butter masala dosa and sambhar vada...the vada was stuffed with kaali mirch...it was tough to decide that vada had kaali mirch or kaali mirch had some vada!!! Very bad experience...very bad...won't go there again.,Rated 1.5,6,4,??
Shadab Akhtar Rabbani,"Rated First visit to the famous Saravana Bhawan. It goes to the top of my South Indian cuisine restaurants. I had my friends for company including the who suggested this place. When we entered the restaurant we got our table easily even though the place almost filled. It gets crowded later in the evening as there was a queue when we were getting out of the restaurant. So to grab a peaceful meal go and grab your seat a bit a early in the evening. The ambience is that of any decent Indian restaurant giving you the essence of South India. We all ordered the Ghee paper roast masala dosa as my friend it's filling as the crispy dosa tastes good. I really liked the dosa especially it's smooth outer finishing with pure ghee. It was served with four variety of dips: sambhar, tomato chutney, green chutney and the classic coconut chutney. My favorite anywhere would be the coconut chutney but the tomato one was the best here. Masala in the dosa was hot and fresh and it was served in a very neat manner. My experience was a good one especially for the taste and service. It's well priced as well. And the rate list/menu on Zomato needs to me updated. Ordered the thali today. Going to write to review soon.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Qarina Zamir,"Rated Heard alot about Saravan Bhavan and when visited recently found that all those praises are indeed true.

Sasha Chhetri,Rated Their Thali is really good and it's a go to to take any tourists. I kill CP + southindian in one go. Nothing beats this cuisine because of the flavours and price!! Don't expect anything fancy it's an Udipi restaurant that's cleans and has good food. A little more clinical than Sagar and the Dahi in their Dahi vada is not as sweet as well. Nothing to rave about as the ratings would suggest but good nonetheless and very very consistent.,Rated 4.0,57,132,??
Nitin Gupta,"Rated This place will always top the chart when it comes into your mind to have south indian food. Amazing taste and tbe taste has been maitained from more than 10 years. You can't beat the service here. Apart from the south indian food, one should try the sweets as well, varieties of ladoo and its packing is really a nice thing there. Rava khichdi (upma) is one of the thing that everyone should have.",Rated 4.5,64,57,??
Mina,"Rated This is probably one of the most successful Indian fast food chains spread thoroughly across the globe. I wondered what made this place such a success? If you go during lunch time youll see a huge line of people waiting for their table. I ordered the mini tiffin, it wasnt so mini it really filled me up good. The big secret to their success was in their chutney. They were the best Ive had, especially the coconut chutney was far superior than any other ones. Its cheap, quick and tasty those three component will get you very far. Highly recommended.",Rated 4.5,87,430,??

Kumud Naugai,Rated Clearly one of the legendary south indian places available on this planet. You can see that by the people waiting to get in almost every weekend at any time. Went there after an IPL match. We were around 10 people and so we had to wait for almost half an hour to get a table. We were so famished that we ordered almost every type of dosa on the menu with idlis and wadas and everything was served pretty quick. The taste is authentic! You cannot ask for a better soul filling experience. We also tried the Badam Halwa and it was like Christmas! Such places soothe you to the core. Must visit! Sevice is awesome. Ambience is awesome and staff is courteous and pleasing.,Rated 4.5,58,177,??
Pragya Khanna Arora,"Rated Not as good as Janpath outlet Food - Chutney was a little too salty, Vada had too much oil Service - Very timely & fast service, but the staff was not very courteous & caring, their emphasis was more on delivering food on tables rather than making sure that people are enjoying their meal ( comparing the service to Janpath outlet) The staff caries the filled food plates by stacking them up above each other, (the rice in the bowl was touching the bottom of the plate kept above it while the staff was carrying it to the table) Also, while taking the order they didn't inform us that they are finished with the whipped cream which is to be served with the icecream, after we showed them that it is mentioned in the menu then only they apologized for not having the cream Overall, not a very good experience Tip - try their other outlet at janpath, give this a miss...",Rated 3.5,16,73,??
Abhishek Taneja,"Rated Awesome south Indian food!! Visiting this place since about a decade and the food is always amazing..their sambhar tastes the best, along with the superb dosas n idli they prepare..another must try is their rawa ladoo which is packed in small transparent balls...there is a scope however in improving customer service as the staff gets a little arrogant at times...all in all a must-visit if u want quality south Indian food",Rated 5.0,3,51,??
Subhayan Chakraborty,"Rated This place is probably the Tamilian equivalent of a McDonald. For more info, check out the piece of paper they provide for you to keep your plates on the table and you will see the scores of outlets they have across the world and India. The CP outlet, one of three in Delhi akin to a computer game. spread across five floors like a game and having equally varying AMBIANCE. Although not focusing on any one theme, the vibe is homely and the clientele is mainly family. The ground floor is done up a bit lavishly and should be your choice in case you're here with family. However, if you have your significant other accompanying you, head to the top floor where the crowd is thinner and the rooms are simpler and smaller for a more intimate affair. Also, this is one of the few places in CP where you are guaranteed a hearty meal without a hole in your pocket. The only drag is the location, which I find just a tad bit too far from any of the metro station gates. Sigh. However, that has not deterred the huge throngs who visit the place. I've come here twice and have ended up ordering the same FOOD twice : Tamil Thali, on both occasions in spite of my zeal for crossing off newer items on the menu. Its a complete package, not referring to the sheer number of items included in it or the size of the meal; but the fact that it is an exotic delight taste, feel and look wise. The thali is brilliant, won't describe it, just try it. :D I've also had some of the Dosas which were equally delicious. Otherwise you're options might be just a little bit restricted since the Dosa prices are a bit elevated. However, it's still nothing as compared to having a meal in any establishment in the surrounding neighborhoods. SERVICE is professional. The waiters are quick, patient and courteous. However, language proficiency might crop up as an issue for some servers who are from down south. Chakraborty Tip : Remember to go up and down the entire place if you have time and find your own little corner. :P",Rated 5.0,148,826,??
Shilpa Chauhan,Rated Being a north Indian I was never a fan of south Indian food... But but then I came to saravana bhavan and they proved me wrong... Yes south Indian food is tasty and one can have it quite often... It's my breakfast staple food... Their samber is so overloaded with flavours.. Best samber ever.

Vasu,"Rated Authentic south Indian food, the only thing that irritates is the long queue. There is always waiting, the condition is worse on weekends. There is a delay in serving the meals as well. But once that yumm food is on the table. You forget everything. There is absolutely no complaint on the food. Very happy and contented. Hate the queue. Do try Rava Masala Dosa and uttappam.",Rated 4.0,2,61,??
Soumyadip Saha,"Rated I've never been a huge fan of south Indian food being a non veg enthusiastic person. Great south Indian restaurants can rarely be found in kolkata too. Now I'm in Delhi and came to know that this restaurant is synonymous with good south Indian food. So I tried my luck and went there yesterday evening. It was not difficult to locate the place, although Connaught place can sometimes be confusing for someone not hailing from Delhi. I thought I'd see a lot of people waiting outside after reading the zomato reviews but thankfully found a seat once entering. The place can serve up to 30+ people at a given time,I think. The waiter was helpful and he suggested me that I should order dahi vada which is a crowd favourite. It was served after 10 mints or so and it was delicious. Loved the vadas. After that I ordered onion rava masala dosai. It was big in size for a kolkata person and tasted quite different from the ones served in kolkata restaurants. Absolutely loved the chutneys, specially the one made with squashed tomatoes I think. It cost me 355 rupees and it was well within my budget for the night. Will come back again on a Sunday morning to try out buttermilk and Idlis.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Kaka,"Rated A place that rightly deserves the perfect score. If you are on the lookout for lip smacking pocket friendly south Indian vegetarian food, look no further. I have visited more than a handful of their outlets around the world and the experience of dining at this place has always been superb. Unlike many popular chains whose taste varies as you go around the world, Be it Dubai or Chennai, they have always kept the authenticity of all their dishes. You can keep going, but never are you going to say 'aaj ka khana theek tha!!', and its these small details they focus on that makes the perfect. They don't care for creativity or ambience, all their outlets have the same design and the same menu, and so does their food, service and quality. My favoraite dishes here: Masala ghee roast, Uthappam, Curd rice, Filter coffee, Buttermilk, Sambhar vada and idli-best in town Idiyappam-good but not sure if these are the best(read: losts of places where in they can improve this dish). Porottas-bit on the smaller side, but they taste excellent Badaam halwa-they might look small but are on the heavy side. A review that is as simple and direct like the experience I have whenever I visit this place, just couldnt make it as 'adipoli' as their food is!!!",Rated 5.0,43,154,??

Hitesh Tanwar,"Rated My review is goin to be an odd one out. As my experience at this place was not that good as others have. ordered an appam with side dish and it was just ok ok also we had a masala dosa which was having too small quantity of filling, but sambar and chutni served along with it was good. had filter coffee which was just a normal one nothing special was there and yes badam halwa for me was just to be avoided. any one may be i am not aware of the cuisine but the place didn't did well with me and yes service was slow. thanks for serving us.",Rated 2.0,121,115,??

Sumeet Singh Johar,"Rated If I had to say something about South Indian food then personally I don't like too much about it but after visiting this place it had brought me to point where I think there is need of retrospection that needs to be done. I ordered Rawa Onion Masala Dosai and Idli. Dosa was perfectly cooked with sambar n green n coconut chutney were outstanding. Idli was soft and one the best I've had. In the end I ordered filter coffee which was served in the steel glass and a 'Katori' overall cutlery used for coffee is very authentic south indian one, which gives an additional taste to the drink. ""Highly Recommended"". Service is swift and hardly takes 10 mins for the food to be served on your table. Ambience is simple, neatly arranged and clean. You can reach this place by taking exit from Gate no 7 at Rajeev Chowk and heading over to the Baba Kharak Singh Road. Then take right and walk towards the outer P-block. A perfect place to visit If you like South Indian cuisine.",Rated 4.0,2,7,??

Dilsefoodie,"Rated I'm a very early riser, and I don't like to miss that beautiful early morning light, especially when it is a weekend morning. So this Saturday I decided to go for a early morning walk with some of my same minded friends @ heart of Delhi & ended up at Sarvana Bhawan C.P for breakfast. To the best of my knowledge the only restaurant in C.P who can serve you all the menu available dishes right from 8 am onwards. If you love authentic south indian food then this is the place to be. They serve a wide variety of dishes probably some of which you've never heard of if you havent been to the south side. We began with South Indian Filter Coffee , which is such a important tool, to kick start the day .The filter coffee was such a great blend of south Indian coffee serving in the steel glass with a small katori so that you not only can mix the sugar & but also can drink & feel the south Indian real touch. After the coffee it was time to order the dishes for the breakfast so we ordered # Ghee paper roast masala dosai:: crispy & crunchy with Very little masala but They really stand out in their chutney, sambhar, and the dosa and it makes the main stuffs adorable. # Hot idly:: Decent enough. They were soft. # sambar vadai:: The Vada sambar was equally good coz the vada were soft from the inside yet crispy at outside.The sambhar is probably one of the best you can have around in the north. # Masala Dosai:: Brown+Yellow in perfect golden in color served with Coconut chutney which was so good. Red chutney was also takes it to another level of taste. # Appam with side Dish:: Keralas most popular dish, when you found in delhi, cant wait to dine in . the soft & well cooked makes it so mouthwatering perfect & light dish. # Uthappam (Coconut)::the normal uthappam , well prepared with the taste of raw coconut on top. # Uthappam (Onion & Tomato)::same with raw onions & chopped tomatoes on top. # DryFruit Rava Dosai:: The Rava dosa needs a perfect technique to cook and they have mastered that art for sure. # Banana Split IceCream::it was such a shocling experience to taste the Banana ice-cream & specially in a south Indian restaurant , never ever heard & didnt even had the intension to order but one of my friend suggested, so we took the initiative, and ended up with such a lovely experience . All the dosas were amazingly filling, with papers plain being crunchiest of all. The taste bud tingler were the chutney accompanying the items! According to me I guess it's definitely, family place where the entire age bracket can come as one for a Happy experiences.Food is value for money, probably one of the finest south Indian cuisine serving places in Delhi , quick service and promt staff.For all south indian food-lovers a must must place to visit in case if you never been here & re-visit if you been here before .

The food is always fresh and warm and the service is really quick. The ambiance is clean and by all standards one the best south Indian cuisine restaurants in the city.

Sachin Sahni,"Rated Since childhood I always had a crazy love for south Indian food. And, as you say South Indian food then you must have to visit Sarvana Bhawan for sure as people told me. I know being a biggest foodie that must be something shocking but I never had a time to visit Sarvana Bhawan it kept on getting delayed. Finally all of a sudden a friend dragged me to this restaurant as we were roaming around CP gallerias. Well, there is no doubt that if you are at a popular and public favorite spot and you wont get a queue but here, you have to wait at least 10 to 15 minutes every time you visit but you just don't have to wait as you have to speak to the person standing at the door who is noting down the list of people who wants to get inside to have food. After 15 minutes of time we also got our name announced and we got in. As soon as we entered we've been told to sit in the basement area but when we went there we were left with no seats... then floor after another we climbed and finally we reached the second floor where we got our table finally... they had a huge menu and varieties of vadai's, dosa's, utthapams etc. but as we were stuffed we decided to order one portion of 14 mini idli sambar and ghee (Where we said a big no to ghee as my friend is allergic to the same) as well we ordered their mini tiffin which has Rawa Khichdi, Ghee Pongal, 5 mini idly sambar and mini masala dosa. If I talk about the taste it was not very extraordinary or something that you may drool for but their main USP is their price of dishes. The place is apt and perfect for the couple who had a craving for south indian as well as want to stick to their budget. But, this place been an epic since many years have been favorite as it evolved more with the time. if I ever be have to back then most problably my reason would be that I am in CP and I am low in budget and I have a craving for south indian... food is not bad at all thats why got a mini tiffin packed for my mom as she loves South Indian food just like I do :) my unbiased rating shall be 3.5 Stars as I really have had some of the great tasting south Indian food below that budget as well. foodietreasure.blogspot.com",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

I have no complaints about the food itself: any South Indian mother will approve it. My favorite is the onion rava masala dosa.The service can be meh, sometimes the waiters are unresponsive and strange, but to me, that's not a huge deal.

Saurabh K. Sharma,"Rated It is an awesome place for south Indian delicacies.. Now onto the details. I was here today with two friends of mine, we are really craving some crackling dosa 's crusts. We had to wait for some time, as regulars will know, there is always a little 10-15 minute wait due to full house ,this fact alone highlights the flavor of this place. We wanted paneer dosa, unfortunately it was not available, so we had butter masala roast dosa , curd rice with mini idlies, First up, curd rice, was a brilliant surprise, with its tangy taste, toped with pickle, I really loved the aroma ,then mini idlies were served, they tasted good, in sambhar gravy and with coconut chutney, nothing extraordinary, but did justice to our expectations.. Last our butter masala roast dosa was just decent, nothing to write home about, green chutney was a lovely blend, amazingly well cooked, so loved that, sambhar was a bit dull on taste side but, has a nice tinge in mouth.. Last we wanted ice creams, then again our likings were not present at that moment. It was a good experience, seating was comfortable and lighting was dim and rich ,I mean it felt very good, our photos were excellent here Service was amazing, little wait between order n served food, so thats another good box ,the restaurant ticked in my book. Only disappointment was absence of our choice of orders in dosa and ice cream, being such a reputed place ,I really didn't liked this minor glitch, so one mark less ,other than this, it was a like a 10 on 10 performance..

Jayantika Sarwal,"Rated Going out with a South Indian friend and eating south indian food means - one ought to have amazing time and enjoy eating the food even more.. Can't recall the number of times I've been here, and with n number of people but this time the food tasted all the more merrier, probably because of the merriest Christmas day! ;) Keeping aside everything else, the place is spread across 2 floors.. Is situated at almost the entrance of P block of CP.. The FOOD is stupendous.. Lavishly being served with 4 chutneys and freshly prepared stuff, the food is best eaten hot. This place would surely leave with you with no time to talk as one would be gauging over food with the taste buds drooling over it again n again.. The SERVICE of food is decent, eve if the place is over crowded. But there's a lag in communication. Maybe because of the language barrier or other reason, converting your wish is a bit not easy. Everything on the menu is great.. But would RECOMMEND : Adiiappam - which is almost sticky noodle type dish served with a mix of assorted veggies in form of a thick gravy. IDLI - So tender, that it might melt in your mouth like Silk chocolate. UTTAPAM - Totally taken away by the consistency and making of this dish.. Loved it. Do try the gun powder chutney that comes accompanying every dish being served.. I've been in love with this place since years, and for all those who might be trying this for the first time would be loving this place for the coming years! Go folks, have a hearty meal out there!

Rawa dosa, uttarpam, & wada sambar was very average chutni could be one differentiator but at hsb found side course to be very average on taste and quality. Service is quick as the staff seems to have mandate to clear a table in just under 1/2hr to maximise revenue per table but as customer I don't bother to get out in that much of time if served well. The only thing which will make me go back to hsb is the badam halwa and amazing fragrance inside the restaurant. Someone need to take a lead and experiment,innovate or discover more on now very boring south Indian veg cuisine.

But, unfortunately this place didn't live upto its hype. I ordered the Rawa Masala Dosa and the Mix Uttapam. The potatoes in the Dosa weren't mashed properly and it also lacked flavor. Also the uttapam was very thick. The sambhar and the chutneys were good though. While leaving, spoke to one of their Kitchen supervisor who agreed about the Uttapam saying it had been tried recently where they didn't spread the batter making it thick in the process. He was kind enough to offer a repeat of the menu. But as I was running late, I left the place in a hurry. The interiors are simple and welcoming. And the service is quick too!

They serve authentic south Indian food only and their whole staff is south Indian which is the best part to maintain that authenticity. Tonight we went there to dine out and got the place easily as it was the monday night. To be very frank i did not like the food much, i love fliter coffee and but here coffee was also ok ok. I know people love this place bt i did not find anything outstanding.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Harshit Anand,"Rated Been there with a friend today and as expected there was a long queue which signifies the demand of this restaurant. Indeed a pioneer restaurant for the South Indian cuisine and the taste is its testimonial. We ordered Masala Dosa, Rava Masala Dosa and thereafter Filter Coffee and Fruit Crunch Exotica. To start with dosas, we found Rava Masala Dosa excellent and Masala Dosa was also nice. Being served over a banana leaf in a plate, to go with the sambhar and tri-colour chutneys, it soothes your eyes too! The dosas were crisp and light with the tasty masala and tastier tomato chutney, although they should give some more masala in their dosas. The coffee had a strong flavour and was very well prepared but for us the winner was Fruit Crunch Exotica which contained their own prepared Alphanso ice-cream over fresh exotic fruits and choco cream over the ice-cream with a cherry on top. Man, the ice-cream had mango pieces in it. One should surely try either Fruit Crunch or Alphanso ice-cream as dessert in Sarvana Bhawan. The service was quick and the staff was polite and well mannered.",Rated 4.0,45,69,??

At first, I must admit, I didn't like the place at all but as the food plates populated our table and we started munching, I loved it. Last week, I went back to Sarvana and the food was just the same. No change in taste and the ambience. Which was great. The mouth-watering dishes they offer are serviced with three types of chutney's like Coconut, Tomato and Mint.My favourites here are Rava Dosa, Tomato Uttappam and Fresh Lime soda. The place is pocket friendly and worth the money.",Rated 4.5,20,5,??
WanderlustGluttony,"Rated Masala Dosai, Sweet Lime (Musambi) No doubt, Masala Dosai was one of the best Dosas I have ever tasted. Dosa with Sambhar and tricolor coconut chutneys was DELICIOUS. Sweet Lime was so so. BUT... The staff had an attitude 'We are the best and even if we are not polite, it won't affect the popularity and demand for the food at Saravana Bhavan'. Might be true!

Ananta Roy,"Rated Yes, its not a 4 or above 4.5 . I visited this restaurant at a very odd time , early evening and hence missed out on their meals which I desperately wanted to try. And to my dismay, their speciality dosas too had run out of stock. So I settled for the Rava Masala Dosa just for the sake of comparing and deciding for myself if its anything extraordinary going by their ratings. I had to wait both at the entrance which is a normal affair here, as well as for the order for about 10 minutes. The oil glazed surface of the dosa caught my eye. It was really a tad bit oily with the masala inside totally damping the crispiness of the Rava. I had expected them to serve the masala separately. I had a quick run through the taste of all the chutneys. To my disappointment, sambar was average. It was not a proper sambar. There are some little known restaurants and sometimes stalls serving better ones. The only plus point was its thick consistency. The red chilli garlic chutney , green chutney (maybe a dash of pudina and lots of crushed peanuts and coconut chutney were pleasantly wonderful. The red and green chutneys had all my attention and they are the best I have had in a long time. However, the Rava dosa again was average and I have had better ones than this one. It was an average experience. This place always has a rush ,so its a bad idea to even think of having a meal at your own leisurely pace.There might be other items which could give an idea of this highly rated restaurant.

Long enough to enjoy coffee at madras coffee house a few stores away. The second time I visited, was this Sunday morning. I was surprised that there was no waiting time Even more, when I fell in love with their mini tiffin. It's a small meal that leaves you satisfied and full stomach It has a mini dosa, sambhar, yummy yummy chutneys and mini idlis. All of them had an explosion of taste and flavours.

Foodyyyyyyy,Rated This place is synonymous to the phrase 'Over prices and over rated south Indian food'. I used to hear a lot about this place serving great south indian food. But my experience was pretty much the opposite. This place serves average south Indian at such expensive price that you would lose the trust in south indian food.

Anurag Chandna,"Rated I have heard a lot about this place that this place serves best south India food in Delhi. I don't agree with this statement at all. I went for a dinner at this place. I wanted to try something different. So I looked in their Specialty Dosai section. I wanted to order Kora Dosai but it was finished by that time. So I ordered Panchhavarna Uthappam. It had 5 different types of Uthapams with sambar and chutneys. All were small and are sufficient for one person. Problem was with the taste. Out of 5 only three were okay. Rest two were terrible. I did not find anything special about that dish. This was not all. I also ordered mix fresh lime soda. They brought lime juice, sweet syrup and soda separately. I had to make an effort to make it. And when I made it , it was awful. I would have liked them to make it on their own and serve it like it is done in all other places. Rasam was average. This place is the costliest south Indian Joint. Cost per person would be 300. This place is rated 4.4 on Zomato. I don't concur with that after my experience. I would rather give it a 2.5. I am not going to this place anytime soon.

I have posted a photo below of uncleared tables. That is during a peak lunch time when there are people waiting outside. The staff was taking their own time to clear the tables. Rasam is served in a beer mug. I had to ask for a bowl and the waiter looked surprised. Food Best south Indian meal is served in Chattisgarh Bhavan period. So this comes close.

The Rava Masala Dosa and Plain Dosa were served with generous helping on sambar, tomato chutney, coriander chutney and coconut chutney. The sambar and chutneys were excellent and as authentic as it good get. The dosas also were crispy and full of flavour (but the butter or ghee dosas taste definitely better!). The Appam, though huge in size, lacked the sponginess and crispiness on the edges. It tasted more like a dosa, than an appam. But the vegetable korma, with cauliflower and tomatoes in spicy coconut gravy, was rich and an excellent side dish to soak the appams before eating. The filter coffee, as expected, was the star! With over 30 restaurants in India and 56 restaurants worldwide, this three decade-old restaurant chain is the best in Delhi, when it comes to South Indian vegetarian cuisine. Don't miss the juice corner and the savories and sweets counter! I picked up a packet of Kai Murukku (handmade murukku) and couple of packets of spicy banana chips.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Seema Bhoi,"Rated Had there been an option to rate between 3.5 and 4, I would have rated 3.9 :) Wondering why there is a waiting line everytime you want to try this place. After 6-7 attempts I managed to hit them early morning. The meals served are fresh and waiting time on the table is not much. Taste is fabulous however not as great as it is hyped. May be because of the affordable cost. Or there is no other place around that serves south indian? Tried the onion dosa and rice idli.

A lot more fancy compared to its South Indian chains, it's located close to my office so I end up going here quite often for a quick lunch. The service is fine and the servers are sweet. Even more so if you speak Tamil/Malayalam =) Some of the things I order usually are: Mini tiffin: great for a meal for one if you're hungry and don't want to choose. Has button idlis, a small dosa (home size), upma with too many dry fruits and some halwa. Standard taste, standard choice. Vadas: excellent! Amongst the best in Delhi. Soft, fluffy and served with the right chutneys and sambhar. Appam and veg stew: delicious soft and fluffy but they need to give more than one appam in a plate! Rava dosa: big and delicious. Served with a range of chutneys. Masala dosa: really delicious and filling with potatoes. Sambhar refills are unlimited. The rasam is served in a beer mug which is pretty cute.

Being a Sunday this place was over packed, which was expected and so we had to wait for around an hour to get a place in here. After around 45 minutes we got the table. So being a South Indian restaurant we ordered a lot of stuff. From Idlis to Dosas to Uttapams, we ordered a lot of food. First up we ordered Idli, Masala Dosai and Onion Utthappam. All were very well cooked and delicious. Excellent Sambhar, served with 3 different types of Chutneys. Superb. Than we called for Rawa Masala Dosai and Panchvarna Utthappam. Again wonderful. We had our taste buds wanting for more, but alas we were full. But how could we not order Filter Coffee here. So we went ahead and called for a Filter Coffee. As expected was delicious. Typical South Indian Coffee. A great finish to the scrumptious meal. Overall, I was glad that I did not miss out on this place and am wanting to come back for more.",Rated 4.5,79,233,??

For me the place is the best south Indian outlet so each and every dish we had is perfect and I am pretty much confident of the fact that any thing on there menu would be great to taste and among the very best. Would personally recommend trying the ghee/butter prepared dosas for the extra ordinary flavourful treat. They put in perfect amount of both ghee/butter in the preparations and I love them. Do give a try to the ice creams, which I had for the first time and was simply blown away at the very first bite. They are simply delightful and different from the usual stuff we get at market. And not to forget the best filter coffee at the end of the meal The one and only negative I feel here is the service just coz of the inattentive servers. They are not much of help in either recommending anything or catering to your needs immediately, so decide>locate>call>and place the ordern it will come to the table on time> ENJOY the FOOD :) Over all the place has such delicious food that overpowers any other negative facts so for me it was and is the best south Indian food joint",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Akshit@ Wanderer Dilettante,"Rated Well i landed up here on a sunday morning after fun filled rahgiri day after a lot of recommendations and find out there's a waiting line because the management has not opened the complete restaurant for public. After about 20 minutes waiting we are seated, order was taken and served quick( the only positive). Despite at not its full capacity, the waiters were unattentive and did not really cared about what the customer is asking for. After the food, we wanted to have a desert and are not allowed to taste the ice-cream even. No coordination between the cashier and the attendant at the counter. We are asked to pick a dessert of their choice because they don't have what we asked for and cannot change the bill once charged (like seriously). The manager cannot comunicate in english or hindi and so we can't explain him our situation which is really bad for this kind of an outlet. A really bad first experience.",Rated 1.5,47,112,??
Sumit Kapoor,"Rated Simply Marvelous !!! Have been reading a lot about saravana Bhavan via friends and on Zomato , so on one early morning while on a visit to holy gurdwara nearby...we decided to go visit this place and was indeed worth a visit. Place wasn't much occupied as have been reading here, we were indeed early 8 am!! Simplicity was the thing i felt here, i am a traveler and have been to south india n number of time, from chennai to cochin. the only thing with south india is being simple and plain. ( the thing missing here was the cold shoulder feeling which u get in south india towards north indian , no offense to anyone ) so it felt much comfortable and welcoming. Now moving towards food : We ordered > a plate of idli , one piece of vada , Appam ,rawa masala dosa and last but not the least filtered south Indian coffee. Idli and Vada came first which were served with 3 chutneys ,my fav gunpowder and sambar, right after the first bite i felt wow, am i really in delhi? just amazing flavors from each and every chutney , my fav of all was green one. ( 5/5) Appam : which wasnt exactly the same as u get in south india, much thicker then the original but taste was good to go with side dish served with it. ( 3.5/5) Onion Rawa masala dosa : Another dish which was amazing and upto real south indian flavors was this masala dosa. big and tasty. ( 4.5/5) A special mention is sambar which was just astonishing, I am not a big fan of having sambar anywhere in north india, as it not at all good as my standards for sambar have been set high since i had awesome sambar in cochin . Filter coffee at the end was just like cherry to the cake. reminded me of my first filter coffee in Coimbatore though it was mere Rs 15 in Coimbatore and 80 bucks here , anyway it's a must try if u are here. (4.5/5) Overall really satisfying and fulling experience , Indeed a must visit place",Rated 4.5,83,493,??

Sakshi,"Rated Sarvana bhawan is a place which feeds not only your hungry tummy but your soul!! I have been to both the outlets in CP zillions of times and have always left this place with a big smile on my face. The entrance to this restaurant is forever crowded with people waiting for their turn to go inside, which speaks volumes about the quality of this restaurant. This well maintained place promises and delivers absolutely lipsmacking, authentic and hygienic south indian food. From their dosas to the uttapams, to their thaali, to their rava kesari, to their parottas, everything is droolworthy without being too heavy on the pocket. On this visit, i ordered a masala dosa, a rava masala dosa and a buttermilk. The masala dosa was just as it should be. Crispy on the outside with a percectly seasoned potato mash on the inside. The rava dosa was a bit too oily for me but tasted really good nevertheless. Something about the food here that steals the show are the extremely delectable chutneys these guys serve the food with. The classic coconut chutney is creamy and fresh. Then there is a coriander coconut chutney which is my personal favourite. The third is the authentic onion tomato chutney. These, along with their delicious, aromatic sambhar are a treat to the senses. The buttermilk is really good and is flavoured with coriander, chillies and ginger making it the perfect summer cooler. But this time, i felt that the buttermilk had been diluted. The service is mostly quick and prompt to manage the large number of customers in and outside the restaurant. The service on the newly constructed second floor is a bit slow though. Plus, while i was happily gorging on my food, a mosquito materialized out of nowhere and decided to dive right into my green chutney. When i showed it to one of the staff members, he replaced my half eaten dosa with an entirely new one!! Whoa!!! P.s. If you are an idli lover, do not forget to order a plate here. I swear the idlis seem to be scooped straight out of the clouds. Extremely soft and light.

Once you get in the attitude of the staff is not good. Lets talk about most important part that is food. The food is decent, nothing special, nothing to do wow about. Once you have ordered the food the staff will stand on your head so that you can quickly finish your food and get you a**es out of there.

We went around at noon, so it was a lunch hour rush. Ordered Utthappam, Paneer Dosai, Plain Dosai, Mini Idli Sambhar and Filtered Coffee. I loved the Paneer Dosai and their Sambhar in the mini Idlis, it was served in ghee. Their recipes takes you far away to Hyderabadi experience; of course their Biryani is famous. The restaurant could fit 100+ people at a time and when we left we could see a long que of people waiting outside the restaurant to grab their delicacies.

Waiters completely ignore my request every time and its just not me they were behaving like this with every other customer . 0 Star. Pricing : Its very cheap. I guess this explain the popularity and miserable service. Us 4 guys bill was 938 Rs, we ordered 4 different dishes and 4 different desserts. Full Star. Ambiance : Ambiance was okay, nothing special to write about it. Half Star.

Sarvana Bhawan never over promises so never under delivers. Their staff offers a consistently unsympathetic indifferent hospitality and I'm saying it in a positive way cz after the first time you never go there with expectations. With a long waiting on weekends Sarvana Bhawan at CP or Janpath offers consistent taste and my personal favourite has always been Appam with side dish. I prefer the white side dish served only in the morning over the yellow one in the evening. I have gone their alone, with office mates and with family and somehow I do remember each of a zillion occasions that I have been there.

Uday Pratap Singh,"Rated I visited this place with my friends at Connaught place. 1. FOOD it was good in taste like every south Indian cuisine but not as best as i listened earlier about Saravana Bhavan. May be it is over hyped. In some dishes they used very large amount of oil and ghee which makes it more greasy. But it looks hygienic and pure. The Dosai they served was good but sauce and samber could be improved. Small idlies looks heavy and greasy but may depend people to people. South Indian filtered coffee was very heavy as a result, it tastes bitter. 2. AMBIENCE I waited more than 15 minutes at the gate to have seats inside, well it could be because of heavy crowd load. It looks clean and hygienic. 3. STAFF I had to ask many times to the staff for the things like spoon, water etc. Management is very poor. I suffered many times. Waiter took very long time to take the order. Staff is south Indian so you may suffer with language. VERDICT You can visit Saravana Bhavan if you are eager to eat some south Indian stuffs. Food is not so costly but not worthy also, even you will face long queues for seats.",Rated 2.0,2,3,??

Kunal Narayan,"Rated If you are looking for really good South Indian food at exiting prices then Sarvana Bhavan is the place to be. Located next to Shivaji Stadium, it is very easy to spot. I have been here many times with friends and family and have not been disappointed even a single time. The menu of Sarvana Bhavan is laden with the list of South Indian delicacies. There is long list of dosas or dosai as it is referred in their menu. The ones to try are the Onion Rava Masala dosai and Onion Masala dosai. The way these dosas are presented is mouth-watering. You get three types of chutneys out of which mint and tomato are my personal favourite. The dosas itself are laden on the banana leaf to give that authentic feel. Another of my favourites is their mini idli sambhar with ghee. The small delicacies can be gulped in go and added ghee gives it that extra flavour. I also tried their panchvarna utthappam which is like an assortment of five small utthappams, each having a different flavour. To end the meal I would highly recommend their filter coffee. It will take you back to Chennai if you have had a sip of filter coffee there. Last but not the least they have a snack bar which gives access to number of finger foods and banana chips from there is a must try. All in all a great experience for your belly. But beware, that there is so much rush during peak lunch (1-3 pm) and dinner (7:30-9:30) times that the waiting times run into 30-45 minutes. On top of that, the way Sarvana Bhavan manages the waiting line will surely put you off if you visit in the deadly peak hours. I mean its high time they get advanced and get a counter system at least for a start. This is the only reason I am cutting their 1 star.",Rated 4.0,4,1,??

On weekends you have to be part of the queue for some time but the food they serve worth waiting. The food will take little bit time but they serve you hot and thats a plus point for me. Dosai and Vadai are great you can eat them any time, Sweets are too good try kesari halwa and beverages are fine. For me they serve one of the best doasi in the city, dosai stuffing is well mixed and they know how to cook a perfect dosai. Sambar taste like heaven, Thali and Mini tiffin are worth trying.

Anuj Karolia,"Rated Overated !! After hearing so much about this place I was taken aback a little as it didn't match the expectations which I had. Reason being the staff and the food ofcourse. It was a fine sunday afternoon and when we saw that there was no waiting outside Saravana Bhawan, considering ourselves fortunate, we decided to witness the reason of it being so popular. But our happiness didn't last long as the staff was not at all paying attention to us when we were standing and waiting in their dining area. I must say that the guard was more courteous than the waiters who were not even responding to us. Coming to the food, we ordered roasted butter masala dosa, idli and filter coffee. The dosa was big enough though the filling was not even sufficient (a big disappointment) considering the size of dosa and the Idlis were fine. I was eagerly waiting for the filter coffee and the moment it came my excitement turned into sorrow as there was bo froth in it. It tasted reallynl nice but how can you serve a filter coffee without any froth in it. Simply unacceptable. Had there been any rush I would have ignored these things but there was no rush in the restaurant and they could have easily attended us. First experience there and a bad one.",Rated 3.5,52,59,??

Although most of times you have to wait outside for ur turn but the wait is worth. Paneer Dosa is the master blaster served by them. Best thing is they serve 3 chutney I.e. Cocunut, Green Herbs & Tomato, which adds a tremendous taste to your meal. Another good thing is they serve juice n shakes as well (although most of the time they are not available).

We ordered rasam and papads, fresh lime and asked for extra sambhar, it was not a dinner but one of those days where even when not hungry, you want to get a taste of the food you love. The waiter was outright rude while taking the order. My friend wanted to charge his phone and asked him if there was an outlet he could connect to, the waiters response was ""reception pe jake khud laga lo."" Worst experience.

Neha Singh,"Rated It's easy to recognize sarvana bhawanz outlet. Infact one doesn't need to ask anyone abt its location either. Scores f people outside (even during lunch hours during weekdays) , eagerly waiting for their names to be called out for a table...easily indicates its presence to you . Outer circle of CP was not that famous for restraz before (recently only it has started to boom with restraz and lounges) and people used to prefer eating at any of the places in inner circle only . But Saravana used to stand out even that time also like today , when people will hop outer circle to eat at this particular outlet . This outlet is located in P block in CP , and is a walk away from gate No. 8 of rajiv chowk metro station. The minute you step-in, it's like time travel. You are instantly transported to the Madras of the 80s/90s, thanks to the aroma of sambar and the light background music in the form of Tamil classics. The interiors are minimal with just furniture , a sweet shop and three floors of seating. There is hardly any south Indian restaurant which can boast of being a truly ""authentic"" other than Saravana Bhavan. And this can be visibly seen in the most comprehensive coverage of almost all the south Indian delicacies, let it be from Andhra, Karnataka, Kerala and of course, TamilNadu. On my visit here with my family , we got our table after one hour of waiting . We ordered a South Indian thali , a Mini tiffin , ghee roast Masala dosa , Rava Masala dosa and 2 filter coffees . South Indian thali offered 6 dishes along with pickle , chutney , curd , 3 pooris , one bowl of rice , papad and sweet. All the dishes were simply made but scrumptious . Infact , thali itself is enuf to satiate u more than enough . Mini tiffin consisted of mini idlis , a mini dosa , upma , rawa halwa , sambhar & chutneys . Idlis were soft and light ; the dosa was crispy and filling was heavenly and tasteful ; upma was like a home.made one ; rawa halwa was delicious and was full ghee . This mini tiffin was one mini south Indian (food)world in itself. Ghee roast dosa was super.crispy and had a light and thin base and is a MUST HAVE here as per me . Rava Masala dosa was no less than amazing too . I am a self.proclaimed coffee addict and saravana's filter coffee is one of the best I have ever had . The presentation depicts the simplicity yet great - a small steel glass of coffee in a cute little bowl. A bit strong & perfect flavor , their filter coffee is a must try for every coffee lover. All this comes at a very easy pricing . Service is very quick & staff is polite and friendly. I have visited Saravana umpteen times in past many years and what has surprised me the most is that the quality of food and taste never deteriorated in any of its branches (3 in Delhi) . A truly amazing experience . MUST VISIT !!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Still Roch insisted we visit this legendary place to try some light brunch. We visited on a Sunday afternoon and there was moderate waiting for 10 mins, which surprisingly increased to 30 mins after sometime, as we entered. This clearly shows the popularity of the place. The service was prompt and the place is neat. We ordered Onion does, tomato onion uttapam and regular idli vada. The dosa was nice but became soggy after sometime. I'm used to eating really crisp dosas down south. The uttapam was filling and delicious. I specially loved the buttermilk which had a hint of mint chilli chutney to it, and light and tangy. The entire meal ended with the customary filter coffee which seals the deal. :-) Overall a very economic place to have legendary South Indian and must visit for anyone who visits CP.",Rated 4.5,175,779,??

We were 4 people and hence ordered Medu Vada, Onion Dosa, Idli, Tomato Onion Uttapam, butter milk and the signature filter coffee. I must say none of the dishes disappointed us. Vada and Idli were super soft, as I like them to be. Idli was so soft that it was just melting in my mouth. Sambhar was just the right taste along with all the chutneys. The taste of chutney in butter milk was pretty tasty. And the steaming hot strong filter coffee....just freshened me up.

Their mini tiffin was what I always ordered but sadly they have compromised on their quality. The ice creams were not available.

Aakash Sahai,"Rated This place is one of the fav veggie of my list, though everyone has to wait for around 15-20mins almost to get a seat ;p Had been there so many times, I can't even remember. But everytime first thing on my table was/is RASAM. Apart from RASAM, I tried everytime new things. From mini idly to dry fruit dosa(don't remember exact name). Dry fruits dosa is best dosa I ever had. Though I don't like dosa and uttapam but still I was able to eat it with lot of interest. Only once I got the opportunity to have thali because of timing problem, otherwise still I m looking for thali. For sweet tooth recommendations are, BASUNDI, rose dessert, and kaju dessert.

Sangharsh Borse,"Rated My love affair with south Indian food started when I moved to Bangalore and continued to flourish during brief stay of two years. To satisfy my craving for authentic food, decided to visit saravana bhavan. Ambiance is simple. Actually this may be termed as feature of south Indian restaurants even in Bangalore. Food :- I settled for mini Tiffin meal and ghee poli . Mini Tiffin includes ghee pongal, mini masala dosai, mini idli, sooji halwa. They serve it with sambar and two chutney (coconut and pudina). SAMBHAR here is authentic. At other places they serve dal with sambar masala and some vegetables. After so many days I ate idli dipped in sambar with tasty coconut chutney. DOSA was thick and soft. GHEE PONGAL is bit average. GHEE POLI reminded me of puran poli(famous Maharashtrian dish). Best part is fillings in ghee poli was jaggery base. As I always prefer jaggery over sugar, it was perfect for me. One of the best restaurant for authentic south India food.",Rated 4.0,50,301,??

Still desperatly I threw a treat and it was nice. One bad thing is queue. The waiters need to bit more mannered. Need to ask from the guest about the mode of Payment before billing rather they expect us to inform them about card payment. Nice for people who can't survive without south Indian.

Getting a table here however is nothing short of a challenge...it's almost like a queue for rationed kerosene oil! So we ordered Mini Tiffin, Mini Idlis with ghee and Sambhar and Sweet Lassi. Mini Tiffin consisted of a small portion of Mini idlis, a mini version of Masala dosa, upma, Rawa halwa, Sambhar and chutney. The dosa was crisp and the filling was flavorful and packed with curry leaves. The upma wasn't great, I've had better. The rawa halwa..pure love :D Mini Idli.. 14 melt in the mouth coin sized idlis dipped in fragrant, delicious, spicy Sambhar and topped with desi gheee..no, it doesn't get better than that unless you find a purple unicorn that shits money! The sweet Lassi was thick, not loaded with sugar and refreshing. We also got a complimentary portion of another sweet dish that was floating in ghee and tasted like jaggery.

Sinchita Kar,"Rated Type of Visit: Personal Wow!! Finally the D Day comes! Heard rave reviews about this place and never got the chance to try. On Independence Day, I decided to meet two of my good foodie friends. So we opted for Saravana Bhawan as one of my friends can't have outside food due to jaundice. Thus, this seemed the perfect option. AMBIENCE: We entered the restaurant at 10:30am and unbelievably it was jam packed! I didn't even expect people to get up so early, come here and breakfast. This raised my expectation that I'm gonna have an awesome morning meal here. FOOD TALKS: Upon seating, within 5 minutes, they served us complimentary halwa. It impressed and the gesture touched me. I guess they gave it out because it was Independence Day. Since I and my other friends had lunch appointment somewhere else, I decided to stick with sweet lassi. Whereas she was famished so she ordered mini idly. My other friend ordered mini-tiffin. The sweet lassi was really good. It was thick, smooth and perfectly sweet. Amazingly, it didn't overpower the sweetness as some outlets do. The mini-idli were good. 14 soft idlis dipped in sambhar. Yummy!! The mini-tiffin was really a good deal worth 125rs. It had two types of chutneys (coconut and mint) along with dosa, upma and Rawa halwa. Upma fell a bit short on expectations. Although dosa was flavorful and Rawa halwa was the showstopper, indeed. SERVICE: It was prompt. Impressed they could manage such a big crowd early in the morning! Overall, I had a good experience because the food is such just simple yet flavourful. Very rare to find!

Usually a white chatni & sambhar is served. Tasty food! But little expensive, I have purposely rated this one .5 star less as it does not fit into the value for money category restaurants. 140/170 for a dosa is certainly not less money though quality of the food is good & no one can complain about it.

They also have a savories counter downstairs which has a great selection of mixtures and namkeens, the onion pakoda is very nice and so is a daal bhujiya kari leaf namkeen.

I found it difficult to make a choice but then I zeroed on ""Rava Dosai"" which was served in a short while! There were tomato sauce, a green chilly chutney infused with rye and coriander and with a pinch of pudina , general but perfect coconut chutney and sambhar. Rava dosai as a layman I deduced to be a crunchy variant of the legendary masala dosa but it doesn't make you feel too full or bloated. Sambhar was slightly mediocre and lacked Imli and amchur greatly. Apart from these, ice creams have myriad choices! The names of these are also catchy along with the taste and flavour. For eg.

The parotta wasn't soft, they have reduced the size too. The kurma was spicy. The idlis were soft, the sambhar was hot with the desi ghee enhancing the flavours all the more.

I like the service provided by the restaurant.Within few minutes your order is served hot.One doesn't really have to shout for extra chutneys or Sambhar. They also serve few dishes like appam which is not common in restaurants like Sagar Ratna. Try filter coffee and some south indian sweets. Also i like the Namkeen bought from here.

Although I've heard many complaints (from South and North Indians alike) about the variety of food served here, rest assured that the dishes that ARE served will not fail to please your taste buds. I've been to the CP outlet in Delhi, which always seems to have a crowd waiting outside. Waiting is the only major downside to this restaurant.

I asked him to get a very crispy masala dosa he got a soft one. Taste of dosa was good texture was nice, the color of sambar as well of dosa was appropriate. Chutneys were not that good.

And after that I try to grab this opportunity in any city. The kitchen and service staff is always on toes during lunch and dinner time. Butter masala Dosa, paneer uthapam, filter coffee are a must have. For quick delivery order Thali that is sufficient to give you all tastes and good quantity plus variety.

Piyush Verma,"Rated After listening to alot of praises from my friends, I finally decided to visit this place. This place is a MUST visit for south Indian food lovers. It is located on the main road of outer circle near Hanuman mandir, Cannaught place. We entered the place with gate keeper and a waiter welcoming us with a smiling face. Ambience was very nice with effective AC (you observe the air first if you visit any place in summer afternoons) and then waiter will offer you water with menu. We ordered a masala dosai, sambhar idly and a mini-tiffin. Food was looking simple yet elegant and full of colors. All the items served in similar looking thali with banana leaf at the bottom. It took a bit long in the service and we waited almost 10 minutes for our turn and when we were finished, it took almost 15 minutes to find a waiter to ask for a cheque. Masala dosai was very nice with soft and spicy aloo ki sabzi. Tomato chatni and coconut chatni with sambhar were complimenting it perfectly. Tomato chatni was my favourite with perfect balance of sourity of tomato and salt giving it a thumbs up. If you want to have a proper south-indian sambhar, this place would be the final destination. Mini-tiffin condosai contained mini masala dosai, mini sambhar idly, rava khichdi and sooji halwa along with green and white coconut chutney. Mini masala dosai was just like a small version of the original dosa but the idlis were like melting in your mouth once you took a bite with sambhar. I personally didn't like the khichdi but it was looking very nice with lots of dry fruits. Sooji halwa was the best especially for those who need some sweet at the end of their meal. To complete your meal and have a perfect day, I would a recommend a pan from Pandey pan bhandar in north avenue to relish your evening. There's extra charge for additional sambhar. It should be removed as a small katori of sambhar cannot handle a huge burden of dosai :p. Mini tiffin recommended.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Tejas Shah,Rated Amazing south Indian food so far. The blend of spices in sambhar and chutney is just out of the world. In deserts litchi with ice-cream is must try. Staff is cooperative too. Service is fast looking at the rush they manage each day.,Rated 5.0,3,51,??

Sailesh Ganeshan,"Rated There's no need to tell how good saravana bhavan is for those who are used to south Indian cuisine, as the name is synonymous with mouth watering south Indian food! However, (selfish) reason why I'm reluctant to give it a fiver is that the pongal here is not the best, not as good as the one you'll get down south, but the dosas n idlis more than make up for lost ground!

Wether its the manager, the server or the person who take away the dishes back.. all work like a team.. highly sync with each other.. the moment you sit, first thing come to your table is water and menu. It is the manager who takes care of your comfort. Sometimes getting a place might be a problem especially during lunch hours, but it is not always. The quantity of food is good.

The staff here is all purely south indian who added all the more added to my illusion of being in one of the small towns restaurants of south india! Talking about the food, i ordered a Onion Rava masala dosai with a soft drink which took ages to cook but the wait was totally worth it! The dosai was served with 3 different types of chutneys white, green and orange red along with sambhar. As compared to the price , the dosai was quite large which could be concluded as it fulfiilled the tummies of 2 persons .. Me and my mom.

Sometimes the yoghurt based items like the Thair Vada or the Dahi with the Thali are extremely sour and old. As an example today both the Thair Vada and the Curds served with Thali were extremely sour and stale. I have also seen them push cold stuff and wrong orders to customers at times. On complaining the guys ignore customers at first and then to the persisting customers they tend to push the same stuff with minor adjustments like reheating the same half eaten stuff - not a south Indian tradition. Once, I also had the experience of being sweet Dahi vada when I ordered salted one and the guys insisted that I had ordered wrong. On the whole the management is arrogant.",Rated 1.0,2,1,??

And there was no crowd, maybe because we picked the right time to go- around 9:30 am. We easily found a place to sit. We ordered the ghee roast paper masala dosa and the onion uttapam. Both were pretty decent. Being a South Indian, I keep comparing the food I eat out with the way my mom and Naani cook. Dosa, I felt, was pretty good. The masala inside was one of the good ones I've had in my life. The uttapam was a little burnt. The onions were cut too big. They should've been finely chopped. But the taste was decent, apart from the burnt thing. The chutneys and sambar were okay. The tomato chutney was exceptional though. Rest was okay. Definitely recommending the paper dosa. It's too heavy, so those who can't deal with that should go for the plain ghee roast paper dosa.",Rated 3.5,103,594,??

The badam halwa is to die for. They have raised the bar of south indian food so high that I have started disliking the south indian served in some other restaurants which I found to be okay earlier.

Shivam Khanna,"Rated Located near janpath metro this one is an easy to locate. Its a heaven for people who like the south indian cuisine. You would often have to wait to get a seat at this restaurant. Once you enter a waiter with PDA will be before you within minutes to take the order. You may find a lot of varieties of dosais and south indian dishes to try. Starting with the paper and onion dosa they are really crispy and cooked in desi ghee (which makes them heavy). The idlis are really soft and fluffy so as to easily absorb the delectable smabhar served along with. Also in the south indian meal thali, served with 12 katori of items is reallt worth trying. The pudding, smabhar and baked chilli stole the limelight. Just keep in mind that the food served is heavy, so always order dishes one by one to avoid wastage.

The moment you enter the restaurant, it feels like south India. Whether it's the staff, the music, the aroma, decor, everything reminds you of the South. The coffee served is great. It arrives in a small steel glass(a convention of the south). The entire course is delicious. All the dishes are served with 2-3 varieties of chutneys.

Vaibhav,"Rated Truly Legendary ! Though many don't have an epicure for south Indian food but trust me, this is the place that they should try once in their lifetime. According to me it is a ""KINGDOM OF CHUTNI"", every spice is so balanced and perfect that even god knows that there might be food scientists not chefs working down in their kitchen. Those who are peculiar in food eating will easily notice the texture and the spices put in. The place is so crowded always that I have to wait whenever I had visited here plus for the food also. The place is clean, well air-conditioned, 2 floor, 3 sections which makes it an ultimate south's food galore. We had a mini-tiffin, a masala dosai, dahi vadai sweet, gulaab jamun, uthappam and Idlis. I am not a hardcore fan on south Indian food but it the only place that promises the authentic taste of the peninsula. The mini tiffin includes rava khichdi (sounds boring but it is super yumm ), mini dosa, 5 mini idlis and halwa with all the regular chatnis (3) and a bowl of sambar. Note : Gulab Jaamuns : I guess people living in delhi particularly the rajputs and punjabis wouldn't like gulaab jaamun as they are small and too soft though they like them slight bigger and little harder ones. But I have been to a south Indian wedding and their method of preparation doesn't allows to size them up or make them hard. PLUS they don't levy service charges too.",Rated 5.0,100,345,??
Amrita Saurabh Garg,"Rated good food although the quality and quantity seems to be going down slowly....the service is quick as is in any south indian joint...the food is tasty and flavorsome....the ambiance is basic although clean on most occasions....I like their various kinds of dosas and utthapams, dahi bada, butter milk...do try their pan if you like a light one!..you can also buy murukku & mysore pak from their packaged stuff...overall a great option any time of the day for a south indian fare!",Rated 4.0,110,57,??
Siddharth Singh,"Rated Visited this place on a Tuesday night along with the missus expecting to just waltz in however there was a queue at the entrance, just that fact alone should tell you how good this place really is (we got a table in 2inutes btw). SB has a great spread of South Indian dishes, for this trip unfortunately we stuck to the staple choices covering masala/rava dosas however the appam and mini idlis ordered at other tables looked very appealing, the ghee roast dosa would get top marks from me however you better plan an extra hour in the gym just to balance out the added fatty goodness ;) Overall, gets a solid two thumbs up from me, the only word of advice - beware of CP parking and the huge queues!

The price is pretty reasonably priced but I think they could work on the food front a bit more! The service was pretty quick, they cleared off our plates as soon as we were done.The servers were fluent in Tamil, English as well as in Hindi. The prices are also really upto the budget.

Aninda Bose,"Rated Saravana Bhavan has changed the way Delhites used to eat South Indian dishes. They serve authentic South Indian meals with variety of chutneys and other accompaniments. The essence of this place is that they serve quickly and food is authentic and hygienic. The challenge is to get an immediate entry as there is always a waiting period of minimum 15 minutes. Nowadays, whenever I feel like having South Indian dishes the destination is Saravana Bhavan. Our order normally includes Rasam and Butter Milk to start with. I prefer their Rava Masala Dosa or a Mini Tiffin (which includes all varieties in small sizes). Another option is Special Thali but it is little too much for a single person, otherwise one can definitely share if in group. Khichdi is also very good. For dessert, it is either Rava Kesari or Badam Halwa. If someone really wants to freak out then one can have their Dilkhush Lassi. It is too sweet and pretty heavy. Overall a delightful place for the lovers of South Indian food. It's worth! It is always full stomach with no extra loads on your pockets. PS: One can also visit the place to enjoy the filter coffee. Today (6 Aug) I went to Saravana Bhavan and had a new ice cream - Kaju Anjeer Ice Cream - it is really nice.",Rated 4.0,63,290,??

Since our third friend (who hates south indian food) wasn't with us, we thought of trying their food. The place is very spacious, ambience is nice, staff is kind. As we looked at the menu card, to our surprise they serve maximum varieties of south indian food in Delhi (as far as our knowledge was concerned)! After trying a good number of south indian restraunts in Delhi, there were many things which were new to us. But there was one thing which took my attention 'extra sambhar'. :( Yes, they charge for extra sambhar. While, I was planning in my head that I will come again with family and here this thing made me like leaving the place. I don't know about others but me and each member of family have around minimum of 3-4 katoris (bowl) of sambhar whenever we eat south indian food. Well, we ordered rawa onion masala dosa and masala dosa. Both we sinfully yum, with each dosa you get two servings of sambhar and 3 types of chutneys, viz, coconut, tomato and a green colour (it was coconut + mint, I guess). The other things which we didn't like at all was stuffing in dosa. It was way too less than what we generally see in dosa. While the place is nice, centrally located, highly praised, with international outlets and serving delicious south indian food. I feel the two points which I mentioned bring a lot of negative feedback. I will give 3 on 5, .5 being deducted for stuffing and 1.5 for extra charges for sambar policy. I request the management to think and bring changes in their policies.",Rated 3.0,7,55,??

Have always been a regular customer for a quick breakfast, a peaceful lunch or a light dinner. The food was always fresh and delicious. However my last couple of times have been very disappointing in terms of food, that we gave as a feedback also, only to be ignored. Hope they get the same quality and taste back.

Whether Im here for breakfast, or lunch, or dinner, it never ceases to impress me. Im a regular here, visiting here more than 4-5 times a month and their quality has just never thwarted me! Yes their dosas are a little oily, so watch out for that! But their mini tiffin is amazing, personally, for the price and the stuff they serve, real good! Ideal for a good, satiating breakfast, that HAS TO end with the Tamil breakfast staple, the filter coffee :D I'd give this place a perfect five! Works for me :)",Rated 5.0,12,25,??

Mehek,"Rated This review is not going to please many people, but here goes. Saravana bhavan is one of the most famous if not legendary restaurants of the capital city. This was my very first visit and I don't really have any memories attached to it either. So what i judged it on, was the food and nothing else. The food I must say is alright. Just alright. But the problem is, when you are serving such a simple and traditional cuisine, alright doesn't cut it. The things I did like were their authenticity, chutneys, the sambhar, filter coffee and the rava khichdi. Now for the things I did not like. The dosa- i tried both the paper roast as well as the normal one, but they were way too oily for my liking and honestly, they did not make me go WOW. The idli- this i must say is my all time favourite dish. But unfortunately, theirs was hard and dry. Not what I like in my idli. So as a first timer, all i would like to say, is that there are some restaurants that make you travel miles and you don't regret it one bit. But this, is not one that I would like to come back to unless I was just in the area and had a real bad craving for south indian food.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The dosa, sambar chutney everything tastes different and kinda authentic. Whatever it is but it tastes good nonetheless. Very hygienic food good ambience reasonable prices considering the location. Quantity is low and you get charged for extra sambar. You pay for the experience rather than filling your stomach.

Vibhav Dwivedi,"Rated I visited saravana bhavan on 13th june, after hearing alot from my knowns.. Short 1. Amazing food, one of the best south indian food you will find in north India 2. Only south india dishes are available. 3. Service and managment is a serious concerns. 4. On your visit do have Badaam Halwa, it has been shortlisted in the 60 must have dishes in Delhi(#43 on list) Detailed Afterw being to so many fun and cool place's pubs n'bar and instead of picking drinks and junk food, a group of 4 college buddies reached SB, located in the outer circle (the block opposite to PVR Rivoli and on outer circle road, it will fall on your left side, immediately after Indira Chowk) to have south india food, Initially I ordered a cup of filter coffee as i simply love coffee along with that we ordered masala dosa and rava masala dosa.. Sambhar was awesome along with the other chutnies, the flavour was too good, you usually don't find here easily.. the taste of dosa was ok types, i didn't find anything special about that.. Most of the dishes that we wanted to order, were missing so we had a very limited to eat, even the person serving us was not willing to help us.. The waiter from the other table helped us..in understanding how the dish is prepared, or how the taste would be.. After finishing these two, we ordered one onion tomato uttapam and onion masala dosa, this is when i got my coffee, after asking it for 3 time.. These 2 onion dishes were a fail, nobody liked it much, and coffee was an ordinary coffee nothing special about it.. The samething happened in the sweet dish too, there were a couple of items written, but they didn't had it so finally we had to take abc(forgot the name).. it was ok types and can be ignored Then came the very special badaam halwa, it was a 40gm small pack, i just loved it.. the content of sugar was perfect, though there was an access of ghee.. They have huge sitting area, with two floor divided into various compartment..

Apart from the regular idli, dosa, uttapams ( highlight for me being the lip-smacking green and red chutneys), one must try the appam and vegetable stew ( available select hours only). The stew is beautiful- the perfect balance of light spices and creaminess of the coconut milk. ""Cauliflower Chops"" as a side dish which is spicy, goes very well with appam and stew. The Parrotas and side dish option is also great with 2 flaky malabar type parrottas that can be enjoyed with the spicy veggie side dish. The quick service is a spectacle in itself. One can also buy certain pre-packed items to take home- the dry onion pakoda and various varieties of murruku make a great tea time snack any day!",Rated 5.0,5,0,??

They are definitely my one stop place in CP whenever i get a South Indian craving. And most of the time, I go for their thalis, it gives me an option to have a nourishing, fulfilling meal and a taste of different things I really miss. Coming to min tiffin, it is their breakfast thatli, which has pongal, a buttery velvetty breakfast khichdi of rice and dal, kesari-sweet semolina, crisp masala dosa, mini idli with sambar and chutneys. Delicious and wholesome. Their lunch thali is also brilliant witth roti, rice, sambar, vatha kuzhambu, koottu, beetroot poriyal, sweet/payasam,appalam(papad), moru(buttermilk),naaranga oorgai(lemon pickle) and they even had something which tasted like a cross between panchamritam and jam!

Service is fast, hygiene is paid attention to and most importantly the food has flavour. The first time I visited this place I was pleasantly surprised by the burst of flavours of the fresh spices and ingredients they use in the food. Even the ubiquitous dosa is nothing like just any other place. Vadas are crispy from the outside and soft from the inside. You can distinctly taste the spices they use in their dosas. Sambhar is just as tasty and I could smell and taste the freshness of the green coriander they had used in the sambhar. I was never a fan of uttapams but their panchavarna utthapam changed that.

Idlis were soft..pretty standard.Upma was really tasty, it had dry fruits which were crunchy and not soggy.The sweet was suji halwa which was again amazing with a hint of kesar in it.It was not too sweet and had the perfect taste.

Aakash Budhiraja,"Rated The only thing I might have disliked about them in all my visits is that the queue! Its a scene one has to see to gauge the popularity of this place with hordes of people waiting for their turn. The ambience is soothing, nothing very specific to the food, but it is a neat and clean place. Quickly, coming to the food, for starters one should try the sweet dahi vada. Moving to the dosas, my favourites have been the steam dosa and the mysore masala dosa. Lying at extreme ends of the spice spectrum, they are a delight to savour, depending upon ones taste buds and gastric moods. The other regular South Indian dishes are pretty good as well. But, what really clinches the deal for them is the assortment of chutneys they serve you, namely the coconut chutney, the mint-coconut, the tomato chutney and the legendary podi or gunpowder as it is commonly known as (and they'll repeat them as many times as you want! :D ) And finally, to smoothen this panorama of spices, you can dig into their halwas and sundaes, and both are good.

Shayak Victor Munshi,"Rated I went to this much hyped place and everything about this place has changed my opinion from my last visit a few years ago.To start with the ever growing and frustrating waiting lines which gives a impression from outside as though some tamasha is under progress.One has to wait anywhere from 15 mins to half and hour and excruciating an hour or maybe more than that and wait is not worth as I further go with the review.We ordered a masala dosa,dry fruits dosa,nimbu soda,lassi and badam halwa.The combination might not sound good in drinks but we ordered what we felt like.To start with the frustration of waiting outside and then getting a table and then ordering till the time food arrives on table you almost feel dead.The service is very very poor and slow which needs to improve not that I say that the food arrives immediately when food is ordered but 15mins waiting plus waiting Outside adds more to the frustration. The masala dosa was good but the filling inside was less probably the less than a quarter size of the dosa not that I expect a roll with filling everywhere but it should be In a decent amount. The dry fruit dosa and lassi was something that my friend had and he didn't enjoy as it was not upto the mark.Both were horribly terrible as per him. The lemon soda was disaster and the way it was presented was like some DIY kit.The lemon juice seems like they squeezed the most sour one and then sugar syrup was so watery seemed like a in house speciality and this could have been replaced either with the sugar cube or sugar free as both dissolve faster than the normal sugar used,expecting honey would be like extra money. Last but not the least the sweet which was the ""badam halwa"" which Itself is a delicacy but the way it was presented which you will see in the pic wouldn't look appealing.It was wrapped in a butter paper almost looked like a melted 50gm local butter from dairy,not a single sign or trace of any visible badam!!! All I could see was a strand of saffron in it which probably explains the color of the halwa.I expected a bowl full of it with some chopped nuts but all that I got was ""babaji Ka thullu"". If you think that people are mad for your food and that's why there is a queue!!!!

Be it a deli or a sit down or a lounge the smells always suggest how clean and fresh the ingredients or the food being served there. However I loved the food here. Had ordered for the sumptuous thali and along with being wholesome it was also delicious. Do try the packed dry take away like chaklis, coconut and other assorted sweets, roasted nuts from the take away counter. I want to go back to try the other fares on offer.",Rated 3.5,27,60,??

The south indian served here is one of the best I have had and the service is amazing as well.

Kislaya Srivastava,"Rated Following the much hyped pomp and show, I decided to visit the place, primarily because I am a huge fan of South Indian cuisines. And quite honestly, the place deserved the hype, minus few shortcomings. The restaurant remains crowded most of the time, and you might be required to register your name and wait in the queue for a few minutes. Only for a few minutes, though. Boasting of sophisticated interiors the ambience is quite comforting, with three air conditioned floors equipped with fine dining and a good concern for privacy. Now, let us talk about food. I ordered 14mini idlies with ghee, Sambhar and chutney, and a completely different area of my tongue was reinvigorated. The taste was unique and was different from any other place where I had had idly sambhar. Plus the ghee applied was the cherry on the cake. Everyone must definitely try this item that they offer. This starter was followed by the main course- the Tamil Nadu Thali- which was equally impressive. Several types of curries were lined up in the plate along with curd, raita, sweet halwa and pickles, which were served with poories and a bowl of rice. Now the menu reads that the Thali items are limited, and the quantity served explains for it. Everything is served in sufficient quantity such that a person with a fairly large appetite would return with an overloaded belly. The taste was exquisite, similar to the taste of authentic south Indian food and the number of curries (dal, Sambhar, rasam, veggies etc.) were sufficient enough to make you think as to which of them or how many of them to include when you take your next morsel. The service though, once you get seated, is a bit poor, that had put me and my partner off to an extent. The staff would serve your order on time and then strangely forget that you're still eating. Nobody filled up our empty glasses with water unless we asked them to, and that too by repeatedly asking them to pay attention to us while they were busy catering other people. The staff members to number of tables ratio is quite less I think, as almost all of hmm were busy taking and delivering orders. They must pay attention to people even after serving their order so as to ensure that anything else, if needed is listened to. Overall, the food was excellent, the ambience et al was good, but the staff service was a bit below the mark. Hence the rating 3.5/5.",Rated 3.5,1,27,??
Joydeep Hazarika,"Rated This is another iconic restaurant of Delhi. It is a bit expensive but serves perhaps the best South Indian dishes in the city.

Everything they use are either disposable or ruggedly usable. Which implies ghat ghey use steelware at all times and disposal printed paper for under the plates. If you are one for sophistication, then this might take you back a step. But ghat makes it very easy to clear the table for them. The service: The service is prompt and clean. They don't waste time at all as they have high tech gadgets to place the order directly to the kitchen , from your table. The food: As I said earlier, this is a pure south indIan delight.

So as we took the delivery of my new car (happy to announce, not bragging), and thought of eating something nice we zeroed in on this place. We reached here at around five o'clock we were amazed to see that it was full on the basement floor,but we got a table easily. We ordered Onion Rava masala dosa that really tasted nice with sambhar different from other South Indian places to eat. Ghee roast masala dosa was another dish that we had and the size of this particular dosa was way too big for one person. The mix uthppam and sambhar idli also tasted decent. DESSERT For desserts we had the golden fantasy that was alphonso mango ice cream with a bed of sponge cake, not being the original choice it did justice to my dessert craving somehow. Service needs a bit of improvement as we ordered onion uthppam and received mined uthppam that too 25 minutes later after the order was placed. Worth a visit for sure, as I said it's like pilgrimage for South Indian food lovers. With Akansha Kalra",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Nischals,"Rated I frankly don't understand what the big deal is about this place and hence the review. I went there after I had heard a great deal about its authentic south indian food. Then I saw the lines outside and thought to myself- this must be great food or they must be offering free food because they lines outside were as big as in front of hanuman mandir nearby. Then I sat down to eat- their mini idlis, dosas, 5 dosa combo platter and south indian thali- and I am still trying to figure out what the fuss was all about. Their food is decent- not too good, not too bad. Its a bit different in taste from the slightly punjabi meets south indian version served at Sagar Ratnabut its not mind blowing at any level. The service is quick & efficient since there is always such a rush, so don't expect to eat in peace, since there will be servers zipping past you, shouting people asking for water, children crying. The hygiene standards are pretty low, the dishes are not properly washed sometimes and their tables & couches are quite a sight. In that respect I found it a little worse than Sagar Ratna.

RishWish,"Rated I fail to understand the hype about this place. The food is below average. I judge a place by the Thali it serves. I sampled the thali here and apart from two dishes nothing tasted good. To make things worse, almost all the dishes on the platter you see in the picture were cold. The saviour for me was the Rasam which was piping hot and strongly spiced as it should be. Speaking of other dishes, the Appam looked fresh and so did the Dosa. Not sure about the sambhar and chutney it was served with. As far as the portions go, they are moderate. The prices are okay. The place lacks hygiene - the floors were dirty and the tables boasted of glass rim stains.",Rated 2.5,73,235,??

On our way we started talking about Sarvana and my friend was shocked to know that I have never been here. One of the finest place to have south indian food. You will surely have to wait before getting in but its worth it. The ambience is very much peaceful and people are just doing nothing but enjoying each and every bite of the food. The food was very fresh and true the name. If you order a ghee roast or a ghee sambar, you will taste some good amount of ghee with amazing sambhar and the red chutney is not to be missed.

Ambiance: typically south Indian. The mograwala who sits outside adds upto the ambiance of the place. Beside the food you can buy south Indian condiments and delicacy from there. Food: quiet good. We tried the thali which was good, apt for one person or if you are a light eater or watching your diet it can be seen as a meal for two as well. The mini idli were fantastic. The best part was sambhar it tasted like homemade sambhar.My 7 year old loved it. I ordered Pongal with ghee. Very nice but a bit heavy on my stomach since I am not a frequent ghee eater. The butter masala dosa and idli were usual. Coffee served tasted like typical filter coffee, I had such in kerala and bangalore. Service: Extremely prompt. They way they operate is very impressive.

Spread across two floors this place has huge seating to offer, but still every time I visit there is a waiting time of minimum 10 mins. The ambiance is decent with soft instrumental music in the background always being played. The service although is quick, but the staff is not hospitable and warm. They will hurriedly attend to you and even after repeated calling will pass by you as if you dont even exist there. Food talks: I have tried more than half of their menu and have never been disappointed on any occasion. The dosas are their speciality but I also love their mini idlis served with sambhar and ghee, curd rice served with pickles and coconut utthapam. After your hearty meal dont forget to have the famous filter coffee. I relish their ice creams as well and love their banana sundae. The place also serves south Indian sweets and savouries which you can get packed from here at a reasonable rate. I devour their coconut ball and special laddus.

Surprising part was that the place had vacant tables on the upper levels but it seems that the person at the door isn't aware of the same. Even when we finished and came down, the upper level was quite empty. However, we saw people waiting outside. We ordered for vada sambhar and a butter dosa. The dosa was crisp and tasted good. However, the vada was not crisp at all. When I asked the server about the vada not being crisp, his answer was because it was soaked in sambhar. Yes, it could be if it was soaked for more than an hour and not if soaked when we ordered. We then asked for fresh lime soda. Here, I was amazed. Look at the picture. Everything was given separately and we had to make it ourself. Hmmm. As I thought, mine was not as drinkable. We also ordered for Kara Dosai. This was stuffed with vegetables and very good. Enjoyed this dosai. We ended with filter coffee - top class.

The place serves you dishes from the state of Tamil Nadu which are both high on taste as well as quality. The first morsel only would tell you about the freshness and the good quality of ingredients. I had their fixed thali and a rava masala dosa for my lunch. The dosa was indeed crispy on the outside, served with 3 chutneys - a red one having tomato and onions, a green one having corriander and curd and lastly one white coconut and dal chutney and an amazing piping hot bowl of sambhar. The thali sported numerous Tamil dishes like poriyal, rasam, etc which were equally good. The butter chilli and coconut sweet in the thali are worth trying. All of these were served with a fried papad, 3 crispy pooris and a reasonable amount of rice making it a scrumptious and filling meal.

Overall the food was nice...really liked rasam which spicy n tangy, Kara dosa was something different to have, ghee paper roast was crispy n delicious and even the dahi vada was good What wasn't nice was the utthpam which was very thick n not even that great in taste, the pineapple juice suggested by the server was tasteless... But the only thing that disappointed was the service...the order took a long time to come plus all the main course want served together , n drinks came after we had finished the meal...

In our most recent visit, we were roaming around their 3rd floor seating area for 20 minutes, no one asked us what we wanted. No one responded to our requests of finding us a seat for 6.

There is lot of rush and very difficult to find a place, we have waited almost half 'n' hour to find a place their. We ordered Rava Masala Dosa and Ghee Roast Masala Dosa from main course and it was simply awesome and the quantity was very good. We also ordered Panchavarna Utthapam and it was too delicious. It is basically combo of 5 types of utthapam (Mutter utthapam, Tomato utthapam, Onion utthapam, Coconut utthapam and Cauliflower utthapam) with all of these they serves delicious sambhar and chutnies. I also tried 'Idiyappam with side dish' it is not very tasty, It is made from rice flour and served with cauliflower gravy. As we were very hungary we also ordered '14 Mini Idly Sambhar & Ghee' and this one is another super duper delicious, the taste of this dish is ultimate. Fliter coffee here is surely not to miss. They have very fine desserts, 'The Kaju-Gulab' is one of the best.

The dosas here are worth dying for and with passage of time I have tried almost every one of them. This might be the best south indian restaurants that you might find at such pocket friendly prices. A dosa will cost u anything between 90 to 150 and apart from dosas you have many other countless dishes that u can eat.... With those delicious spread of chutneys.

Subhajit Basu,"Rated Authentic South Indian food which hits the soul. Have tried the 3 outlets in NCR but this one,by far beats the rest. The mini idlis with ghee and sambar is ideal for breakfast while the thalis served for lunch are definite too die for but not for the little bellied here. Special applause to the friendly staff who are friendly, courteous and prompt with their little ""ATM type"" machines which place kitchen orders in seconds. +5 if evaluated only on food and ambience ; however two small cons to this store : a. No or little parking space b. Queues are often long during the rush hours even on weekdays. Limited attention given to manage the queue often results in confrontations/quarrels between customers and/or waiter(s) ; something which could be avoided I guess. However, a must visit if you are in Delhi and happen to be in CP hungry for a big meal !!! And oh...I almost forgot...the filter coffee is to die for...if you want a show...ask one of the servers to mix it for you!!! Believe me...you are in for a treat.",Rated 4.0,5,33,??

I have never had a dry fruit dosai before and it was fun to find raisins, cashew, almonds and pistachios in the dosai giving it a unique sweet flavor.

Simran Dhaliwal,"Rated Been there done that. Yet, you come again and stand in queue, waiting for your turn to be seated. The place seems to be equally famous for food and its waiting time. But guess you do not have too many good places to choose when it comes to good south Indian at reasonable price. Once you are inside, everything seems to be a bit mechanical. You sit. Someone comes to put paper mats. Then comes water. Order taken. And the moment you finish someone is waiting to clear the plates. Prompt or intruding is a debate going in my head for some time now. Come here for just a good south Indian meal. (Not so authentic going by some south Indian friends). Have tried their thali time and again. I am not a fan of south Indian rice thus usually opt for puri only thali. It comes with sambhar, rasam, dal, a very sour yet tasty curry (I still dont know whats it called), an option of beans cooked in coconut or chakundar along with raita, curd, pickle, papad, and a sweet. Leaving dal, I like almost everything. Even though am finicky when it comes to eating vegges yet I relish the preparations they make for thali, specially the ones cooked with coconut, along with puri. The idlis are fresh and soft. The dosa light on tummy and amazingly crisp. Along with sambhar it is served with green, tomato, gun powder and coconut chutney. This happens to be the only place where I manage to finish a dosa myself. They are generous with extra serving of chutney and sambhar. On my last visit we had appam with gobhi sabzi. This was just too good. Between three of us, we ordered 2 more of it. The appams were very light and perfectly cooked. The side dish was a bit on the sour side and tasted good with appams. I wish they start serving appams separately. The dahi vada is cool and refreshing. Even though I have always had a good experience as far as food is concerned, I sincerely feel they can work a bit on the ambiance of the place, and the staff can do with some occasional smiles. Till then the saunf that comes with the cheque is a good option :)",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

I just love love love the mini idlis here. It is a very yummy dish with small sized idlis dipped in sambhar and topped with some ghee. A must try. Their dosas are also nice. The rawa masala and paneer dosa are yummy. Because they have a traditional preparation, their uttapams are thick and very different than the ones you usually get at other south indian restaurants. Nonetheless, I like their onion uttapam. And the chutneys they serve are also very yummy. Once we ordered a thali and it came with items we had never heard of or eaten. Maybe the flavours weren't adaptable for a tongue used to the spicy and tangy north indian food. However, their rasam is really nice and feels nice and warm while gulping down the throat.

It took me some time to figure this place. I ordered a Rawa Masala Dosa ( well that's my favourite ). What do I need to say about that. I had the best dosa in a long time in Delhi. It was crispy and the filling of aloo was terrific. The ambience of the place is simple, clean and very much hygienic. The food was served at the earliest and I didn't have to wait much. The only think I kind of dislikes was the waiters were a little tough to crack. Moreover at this price there is no good food available in this area.

My favs include Ghee Paper Roast and Onion Rava. The former is amazingly crisp while the latter has a fantastic flavour. The lemon rice is always a good side-dish.

Sukhmani Sakhi,"Rated As mentioned earlier in my reviews, South Indian Cuisine happens to be my least favourite but apparently Sarvana Bhawan is ""the spot"" that is popular to be serving the best South Indian food in delhi, as I have been told. Was this information correct? No, not for me at least. They serve good, clean food but there isn't anything legendary in the flavours and concoction. Ambience: The restaurant is made to deliver a homely humble eating experience. They have a big enough sitting area and small cubicle like spaces which manages to give an almost private feeling. There is an open area is well and the restaurant has an upbeat and cheerful vibe to it. Service: The servers are smart and well spoken. The orders are quickly taken and efficiently delivered. Food: The menu is interesting consisting of the standard traditional South Indian dishes as well as some modified versions to serve a greater customer base. Paneer Dosa was well made filled with flavourful paneer filling. I loved the different chutneys that accompanied it. The sambar tasted very ordinary and the Dosa was pretty heavy ! Tomato coconut Uttapam was cooked fine. Mild flavours and decent on the palate. 14 mini idlis with sambar and ghee were just sad. The flavours weren't the best and the dish was hard to eat. Lemon rice tasted ordinary again. Masala Rawa Dosa was made well and crunchy. The flavours were adequate ! Sweet Lassi was just funny. It was almost like they poured curd into a glass and called it lassi. Verdict : This restaurant serves just about the usual South Indian food that is available anywhere in delhi. The hype around it is just in vain. I have definitely eaten better. Cost/ person : Rs 300 Will I visit again? No",Rated 3.5,136,1168,??

Sonal Mahendru,"Rated Another gem for vegans, Saravana Bhavan is centrally located in Cp. We went in a group of seven and binged on the food like anything. It's a paradise for dosa lovers. Not only they have masala dosa, rava dosa and ghee roast dosa but also, dryfruit dosa. *surprise surprise* They have branches across the world and their menu card is bombarded with variety. Quite literally! From idli to khichdi, from vadas to uthapams and dosas to curd rice - every other dish is delectable. They also have some options for sweets and drinks. The ambiance is great! They have comfortable arrangements and lively surroundings. Service is quick! The food comes too fast and instantly takes over the hunger pang. Price of the dishes are economical, a big hit at this price. And lastly, food - as hinted above Super Delicious. Final scorecard: 4.5/5 (0.5 less for the staff who seems too busy to educate the customer for options, and for being a bit harsh on cleaning AS SOON AS you end your meal - as if to hint you to pay and leave.) yummydelhi.wordpress.com",Rated 4.5,80,3911,??

If you want to go into more authenticity, please try Iddiyapam which is like a rice noodle roti - very light and refreshing. Their thali is also good with quite different tastes like a yellow dal in coconut base, a dry subzi (generally the highlight of the thali) etc. The problem is that the sambhar they used to make at their initial years of opening in delhi (with hefty amount of shallots and very nice blend of spices) has gone down in quality ( still it is good and distinct than other south indian restaurants). Also try to go in the morning because their is a minimum wait of 15 minutes in peak hours.

The sambhar was just right, not sweet,not very hot,in mumbai the sambhar is more sweet to match the taste buds of a few communities who like it little sweet., I missed trying their lemon rice.Make sure you read the menu as they have their authentic rice dishes on particular days.

Ghee Pongal was good lots of ghee was there. Halwa was normal. The taste was there and you can figure out all the ingredients separately after putting in your mouth. If you are an regular eater of South Indian food, then i wouldnt suggest, as Dosa and idli you can find in your neighborhood.

In Drinks :- I try and enjoy only one thing over here i.e. Filter Coffee (while I am sure there are other outlet's which serve better coffee than this ) however they have their own aroma and taste . In food we ordered :- Rawa Dosa, Plain Dosa , Coconut Dosa(It was pretty different and good as well) The sambhar was also nice (not that thin and not that thick ..I would say the proper mixture) We also ordered Mixed Uttapam .

Price: 4.5 Based on the food they serve the prices are pretty apt. Although, i suggest to give a visit durung lunch hours as there lunch thali is quite cheap and easy on pocket comparitively. Ambience: 3 I found it Not very cleanly maintained might be difficult due to the high number of people visiting and given the crowd i noticed the place seemed smaller and did had a waiting line at that time of hour. Staff: 3.5 Were busy mostly and were trying to work fast to deal with the demand. Not very humble. Locality: 3.5 Well in cp how difficult can it be to fibd the place.

On the ground floor along with the seating, they have a counter where they sell their goodies. We ordered for mini thali, onion rawa masala dosa, plain masala dosa & a filter coffee. Their mini thali is really great including - sambar rice, curd rice, chappati, dal, rava sheera, lemon rice & papads. Only the dal was a little disappointing rest every thing in the thali was awesome and is as good as home cooked south indian food. The dosa is served with sambar & 3 types of chutneys. Filter coffee was the perfect south indian filter coffee. The quality & quantity of the food is really great. The place is nice & clean. The service is really quick & the food is value for money.

Ashish Shinde,"Rated Went there yesterday, place wasn't crowded at that time. But, I had a feeling that it is going to blast in few moments. Everyone in the staff seems to be in a hurry (it's expected!). We got a nice corner table, we ordered - 2 Plates Vada, 1 Masala dosa, 1 Onion Rawa Masala dosa and 1 Ghee pongal. And, we sat and sat and sat for approximately 20 mins which is a long period of time (especially when someone's really hungry). Finally the food arrived, I was having Ghee pongal. I was disappointed by the quantity of pongal, I felt like I can finish it in three bites. The taste was okay, not great. (There was no ghee in ghee pongal). Dosa's and Vadas were fine (I didn't have them, this is for my friends). Then I ordered a Onion rawa masala dosa, it was good. What I really good felt about was the sambar, the taste was great however it was missing the veggies. The coconut chutney was great too. And, we finished it off with filter coffees, I requested them to pack it, the staff was really generous to pack it with spoons and sugar. However, I asked specifically keep it strong which it wasn't. Full of milk! Which i don't particularly like. Finally the cheque arrived, I think the price was okay, give it a try if you like authentic south Indian food.",Rated 3.5,3,7,??

Ameya Bothara,"Rated Perfect weather, no endless crowd even on a Sunday and my ferocious appetite for South Indian snacks brought me here today. Great ambiance, fast service and delicious offerings will continue to make this place a legendary South Indian breakfast heaven. We tried the sambar vada first, which I expected to be batata vada but got medu vada instead.( They also have a separate listing of medu vada so I assumed this one would be batata vada, now realized only the Uduppi ones have batata vada). The sambar vada was delicious with their sambar and chutney preparation being on point. We also had the Mini Tiffin which had most of the specialities like the masala dosai, mini idlis, pongal and kesari. Dosai and mini idli were fabulous. Ghee pongal was a little bland and I was considering it to be the same as an Upma or Uppit. Kesari was a nice desert rich in ghee and cashews bidding farewell to an awesome breakfast. We wanted to try the coffee here but considered going to Indian Coffee House (big mistake: decent coffee and hours of wait, not worth it). I tried Idiyappam which is a sevai prepared like a roti. We had it with korma and it was delicious. But as in North India, I find these places which have reached cult following charge a bomb for their offerings. Mini Tiffin was the VFM and rest all was unnecessarily expensive.",Rated 4.0,84,316,??
Nitin Santhosh,"Rated Went here yesterday for the second time. There was a long line outside the restaurant to get a table. I was astonished seeing the diversity of the guests coming in for a South Indian fare. We finally got a table after 15 minutes and were ushered to our seats. The service was not prompt and we had to wait again. We ordered onion rava dosa, idli, dahi vada with sugar, plain uthappam and watermelon juice, but they did not have any watermelons, so I took the pomegranate one instated. I gotta say, the sambar was very salty, and the tomato chutney was bland. The dahi vada was good, albeit in the form of a dessert. The idlis were not well made, still doughy. The pomegranate juice was as usual very refreshing, but I was disappointed that they were out of watermelons. We got the bill after the bearer dawdled for 10 minutes.

We got a table for four without fuss and menus handed over. Then we witnessed the down slide. The food was ok -- all the dosas were a bit oily, the lemon rice was super! But the service was dismal, cranky and sulky. A meal for four that would not have taken more than 45 minutes stretched infinitely and this is after numerous complaints.

I ordered a Dosa and it was good as always, but the red chunky chutney that used to be given with it wasn't there.

Can I ask the restaurant to perhaps get feedback on that chutney and bring back the same chunky chutney, or at least give an option to the customers? Original Review: ========= Can I say something about this place that hasn't been said over and over already? This is a place that I have travelled a 100 KMs to go to in my college days.

It's hard to pick a favourite from their scrumptious menu but their Thali wins hands down! Drown the Thali with a steaming glass of filter coffee or freshly squeezed juice or cold coffee (It's difficult to make a choice! ) While here it is a crime to not begin the meal with a steaming glass of rasam with crispy poppadom. They have recently done the interiors and expanded the lower seating area to accommodate more people..I would still prefer the old look instead of the new 'just arrived' look though.

They don't just play non-pretentiousness (which frankly I don't care much about if your food is as good as their's) but they have this rude cold decorum. I took a friend with me and they absolutely hated waiting outside all the more because the door people are extremely rude. No, girl it does not matter if we both are females, you are NOT touching me. They need to understand they are in the hospitality business. Now that I have said that, do not miss their Kara Dosa.

Mysticpragya,"Rated A good place. I like to go to this place when I need to get some breakfast and I head out of the house early. Usually they open around 7.20 am and you wouldn't find too much crowd until I guess 11 am. Now this place opens around 8.15am.( Edit) They serve good South Indian, pretty authentic. Their best sellers are onion masala dosa and paneer dosa. We tried the plain masala dosa, onion masala dosa, idli and vadai sambar, filter coffee and tea. The onion masala dosa has just too much onion in it and it's raw so it's not really cooked. The masala dosa is nice and pretty decent in portion. The aloo they put in is quite less, although if you run out of it you can ask for more! I want to add that I have had a better masala dosa elsewhere, like in Mayur Vihar. The idli and vadai's are good. It's light and fresh. They always have delicious sambar. The tea is very good and the filter coffee is okay. The paneer dosa seems to be a high seller although I'm not a paneer person so didn't get to try that. Overall the cost is efficient and reasonable. Food is also above average and some items are good, like idli and vadai. This place is nice to catch up on some early breakfast when no other place is open.

They were too good. The only restaurant in Delhi that serves the South Indian Rice. Crowded, the waiting time is too much (You wait for longer than the time you take to eat).

The appams taste like they're directly from kerala. The wide variety of chutneys they offer is excellent. The service can be better however it feels genuine.

Shilpa Malhotra,"Rated Almost all the reviews would talk about the long waiting at Sarvana Bhavan and that there is. Hungry and angry, you definitely tend to order more than required. What follows is the most pleasant medley of South Indian flavors in a North Indian style. You soon find the soft and steaming idlis waiting to get dipped in the delicious sambhar and chutneys. Or try the crunch filled Medhu Vada and the crusty rava dosa is a must try. And for those with a larger appetite, the thali offers an interesting mix of South Indian vegetables served with tangy pickles and pooris, if you like. And further if you want to totally die of glutton guilt, try the badam halwa made of nothing but ounces of ghee. One spoon can definitely add a kilogram to your weight. Indulge in the south Indian delicacies as much and end up paying a nominal bill.",Rated 4.0,66,360,??

One must definitely order the malabari paratha. It was mind blowing. The idli was exceptionally soft and the dosa was huge. Do try all the chutneys they serve. The uthapam was soft, though the extra onions might be something you would want to know in advance. For dessert we had gulab jamuns and i cant describe just how soft they were.

Smriti Suresh,"Rated Any place which reminds you of good 'ol home cooked food, is light on the taste buds and yet rich in taste HAS to be brilliant right? Wrong. Despite having a menu that packs in quite a punch and food that manifests it's value with queues running up to miles, this place misses the bus when it comes to service. Waiters are often seen to be pushing the bill much before the meal is over and the service is incredibly slow even on days/hours when the perennial rush has died down. Although a place as popular as this will definitely be prone to such logistical glitches, a customer who values the food and yet is dissatisfied with the service may choose another place the next time. So HSB, if you're reading this, please do something about that so that the next time I review you guys it is only about the glorious dosas, full meals, mini thalis, hearty uthapams and not about that pesky waiter who JUST wouldn't wait for me to finish gulping down my glass of rasam.

Apart from all the delicacies served here including the dosas, rasam etc, it was the filter coffee that interested me the most.

The service is quick considering the rush that always keeps them busy. Every time I have eaten here, I must have waited for atleast 30 mins or so to get in.. But the wait is always worth the wait. Because you get such nicely cooked, neat and stunnigly presented south indian dishes. Sarvana Bhavan gets 9/10 for its flavorful food. I only wish they get a bigger space to manage the customers.

The ambiance itself was purely South Indian with the aroma of sambhar and spices challenging your your saliva glands till you hit a table. I tried out the thali, which they serve in small kotoris. The thali was above average considering I tried these in lots of South places. Interestingly finding a Tamil guy speaking fluent Hindi was a surprise to me. The servers were fluent in Tamil, English as well as in Hindi. I must admire and suggest everyone to try Ghee Roast Dosa and Mysore Dosa as they were complete delights. I was disappointed with the filter coffee they serve. Overall experience and food was awesome and a must visit place for tummy striving for south indian course.

Bhawuk Garg,"Rated Everyone was singing praises of this restaurant which made it obligatory for me to visit it and I was nothing but delighted to have done that. First we had to wait outside for little while as it was the weekend. It took around 15-20 min. Now after entering the first thing a person notices is ambiance of the place which was not so stupefying. The staff was well-behaved and courteous. Coming to the food, the first thing which we ordered was Rasam with Appalam and believe you me, it was the best Rasam I have ever had so far. After that we ordered 14 idlis in sambar with ghee and the idlis melted the moment I put it my mouth. Amount of spices was more than perfect. Id kill for those idlis and sambar. After that came Rava dosai and Ghee roasted paper masala dosai which I felt took away the charm of the moment. They were not as crispy as one expects them to be. I felt that they were a bit under-cooked. So Id definitely not recommend the dosas. We ended our meal with dahi vada which was quite overpriced for its taste. Then came the filter coffee which I have always loved. The service of the restaurant was also good keeping in mind the number of customers they handle. So in a nutshell it was a good experience even though I didn't like the dosa but the other things made up for that.",Rated 3.5,16,74,??

Priyanka Singh,"Rated Saravana Bhavan is a name which stands aptly for an option which serves really the best and authentic South Indian food in Delhi. I am quite fond of South Indian flavours when it comes to give a change to my tastebuds from the regular routine food. And no other place can be a better option to try my hands than Saravana Bhavan on South Indian cuisine. So my desire ended at it, it is in the heart of Delhi ie. Connaught place. When i entered there the very first thing which caught my attention was the very unique decor which comprises of golden colour interconnected kalash or can say lota or small matki kind vessel which was providing an edge to the whole look. It was like wow and in my mind i was wondering if i get to sit there and then suddenly the manager asked us to sit there only, it was like super wow coz that space was having seating of two only and rest of the seating was like any other south indian restaurant . Then we ordered my hubby's favourite Ghee roast dosa, 1 mini tiffin which included one mini masala dosa,5 mini idli sambhar, rawa kesari ie. Sooji halwa n rawa kichadi. The Ghee roast dosa was superb in taste n it was accompanied by three colourful chutneys which were also awesome in taste but my favourite one was the green one. Next was the mini tiffin thali which was having my favourite masala dosa, perfectly done n crisp , the idlis were very soft n sambhar was also just right. Rawa kesari was very flavourful n sweet which i liked a lot, the essence of kesar was coming out quite well. The service was quite good , the manager himself attended us n he was also quite polite n willing to make us taste their best delicacies, so we asked him to suggest us the flavours of icecream which we should try, so immediately he answered mango n dry fruit which was exactly our choice also. So we went with the same, the icecream was also quite good n otherwise also i like them more in winters. The authenticity n the hygiene are the two keywords which i observed for the Saravana Bhavan n on that basis it is a strong recommendation for those who really love south indian flavours.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The Feast That's Life,"Rated This place has its loyalists, and that can be seen easily from the long waiting line that is almost always there outside this restaurant. Without intending to offend any of them, I have to say this place is very disappointing. I remember going here a long time back, and enjoying the food, though even back then it wasn't my favourite for south indian. But after having gone there recently, I have to say, the quality of the food has gone down a lot over time. I ordered idli, vada, kada dosai and butter roast dosai. The idlis were soft and fresh, but the vada was too oily. Same goes for both the dosas- they were way too oily. The kada dosai has this red chutney spread on the inside, which is supposed to be spicy as it made of a mix of red chilies and a few spices. But it was not spicy at all and I just didn't enjoy it. The sambar was also slightly sweet, rather than being tangy. Also, the service, though quick, is not warm at all, and it just seems as if they are in a hurry to get you out and get the next customer in.

Quick they are, but you get a feeling they can't wait for you to leave. Food tastes average compared to Sagar Ratna. The waiters offer unsmiling service like they are doing you a favor! Portion size is not very generous. And as ambiance, wait a minute ... what ambiance? It has a cheap railway canteen feel. No music. Tables placed close enough to knock elbows with other diners.

Although, nothing beats the classic Masala Dosa and Vada-Idli platter. Team up your food with Filter coffee and finish it up with Sooji ka Halwa. You can also try the other Desserts and Juices. The Thalis are amazing and absolutely value for money. You might have to wait for a long time during peak hours and weekends, be ready for that! Also, you will end up sharing a table with total strangers, but it's all good as long as what they serve you is mouth-melting and that, it is.

Love their superhot and soft appams with delicious gobhi suzi, their flaky porattos smelling of sweet ghee with side dishes, their khichdi, nutty upma and of course their vegetable laden soft and crispy uttpama and amazingly textured dosas. Their thalis are famous for the wide variety of lip smacking accompaniments and chutneys. Their halwas are just rightly sweet and this is one place where you will not miss any chocolate desserts. I am a fan of this place like many others and would suggest all you foodies to try their other offerings instead of regular dosa, idli and uttapam (though these are great too). South Indian food is so much more than these usual dishes, and this place is where you can safely experiment. Servers are very fast, at times slightly snappish, but hell..that's ok! It is unintentional an their hearts are in the right place. Go and try this legendary place!",Rated 5.0,51,479,??
Rohit Sen,"Rated One of the best places in Delhi to have authentic South Indian food. Though Savarna bhavan is legend in itself but I don't understand why people are so so crazy about this place. Everyone in Delhi knows about this place-almost everyone. I hate the waiting time here but what not for some authentic south Indian food. Food is really good quality wise, authentic and their service is impeccable as everyone knows. The servers look like they have decended from a James Bond movie busy with their work, each person is aware of his surroundings. They have a plus point because of their location. Perfectly managed place- kudos for that. Definitely recommended for South Indian cuisine. Happy eating!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Everything we ordered tasted okay! The only Great thing about the place ironically was Sweet Lassi and Butter Milk!

Their managers come up to you with machines in hand as if they are going to give you a ticket, but its their sense of humour, they are their to take your order on those fancy machines. They usually take some time to deliver, because people are so find of this place that they are always running high on orders. If you feel like eating south indian, you can go here.

Well to tell you the fact somehow the taste just does not go with the kind of South India we are use to eating, though not bad but not among our favourite places firstly cause the waiting is not kind off justified with the hype of the outlet in terms of food per se.

Kartikeya Tiwari,"Rated Few days back, I was to go to Andhra Bhawan on Sunday, which offcourse I did but to my displeasure it was riots there. It seemed that entire Delhi was queuing up to eat there, which made me quickly find another place in nearby vicinity, and that took me to Saravana Bhawan. I was with few friends of mine, and we ordered our regular stuff there, one masala dosa, one rawa masala, one Onion vada, and one rava khichdi. Well Dosa is known as DOSAI there, Rava Khickhi means upma, Vada is known as Vadai here. Sometimes I find it tough to judge the quality or taste of south Indian vegetarian food as the difference between good and bad is very less. The cuisine just doesn't have anything bad in it. Nevertheless the food here was pretty nice, like majority of south Indian joints in Delhi we had to wait as there were many people outside, the wait was offcourse not so much, our stay was short and sweet as somehow all South Indian places are QSR's ( Quick Service Restaurant ), the food is on your table within 5 minutes of the order.

What makes the dishes more special and tasty is the Green and tomato Chutney that they offer apart from sambhar and coconut chutney. Also tried and would recommend South Indian Paratha which comes with a vegetable side dish, Thali (Good enough for one person). Any dosai from the menu wont disappoint you at all. For Desserts: Fruit crunch, Choco crunch. Ambience : Simple yet elegant with south music playing in background giving a total feel of restaurant. Two floors of space caters for the amount of the crowd that comes in. Service : Visiting on weekend evening expect a delay of 15-20 mins in getting table.

Deeksha Tandon,"Rated I was a huge fan of this place having visited it since childhood even in Chennai. When it came to Delhi, I was thrilled. The first few visits were delightful. But I recently went there again on a packed Sunday afternoon and the experience wasn't so good. First of all, the never ending waiting. We made through that and finally entered the joint. Without looking at the menu ordered the standard dishes, masala cosa, uttapam, etc. Well, surprise surprise! The sambhar wasn't hot. The dosa was rather thick. Uttapam was so so. The drinks came when we were about to finish our food. I don't remember the rest. So basically, after waiting for abt half an hour, sitting an overly crowded place, with excessive chitter chatter all around, the experience was not so great. The food was disappointing and having to wait for ages before a waiter showed up at your table did it help either. I would definitely go back, being a lover of south Indian food. But maybe I'll give it a break for a while and visit perhaps on a working day at an odd hour. Hope to receive better service next time, fingers crossed.",Rated 3.0,155,507,??

Getting a table can lead to long lines and an hour wait but you will definitely not regret it. Service is almost quick and pleasing .They serve 4 variety of chutnies which are usually the highlight to relish the food along. rava or rava masala dosa is amazing but a bit oily so you will end up soaking tissues over it ...

Absolutely, Not an aorta loss of quality in the food. People who have been to Chennai Outlets would know what I'm talking about. Also, It never dents your pocket. I took 15 of my office colleagues (6-7 people good voluminous eaters) and still i paid only Rs. 2800 only. We had everything.

Rajat Arora,"Rated Location: Both the outlets located in the heart of Delhi (one at outer circle - Shivaji Stadium block, next to McDonalds, the other one at Janpath, again next to McDonalds) , it is easily accessible from all parts of Delhi, parking is a concern at the CP outlet, though there is sufficient parking available at the Janpath outlet. Timing : Though it is open till 11 PM, but if you really have to avoid long waiting, please bee there before 8.30 PM. Also, the signature dishes like the SOUTH INDIAN PAROTTA is not available after 10 PM. Food : If you really want to taste authentic south indian food, this is the place to be...for those who want to come here and toast for any occasion, a glass of Rasam with papad is a perfect way to start your evening and enjoy with your family and friends. The traditional dosas have the perfect blend of south Indian flavor, but you must also try the appam with a side dish and a south Indian platter...which serves small portion of idli,vada,dosa and utthapam. A perfect way to end your meal is to have Rava kesri halwa which though is a bit heavy on stomach (considering they use Desi ghee), but it is a must have during winters alongwith the standard filter coffee- served and stirred in the 'south Indian way' Price: A value for money way to enjoy authentic south Indian food right in the heart of city, the per head price varies between INR 150/- to INR 300/- depending whether you opt for drinks and dessert, but always a value for money. Ambience : This place is mostly crowded, so you can avoid this place if you are looking to take someone special to spend some peaceful moments, as you will always be bogged down by the food ordered on table next to you. The orders are punched in on a swipe/touch pad which gets automatically transmitted to the kitchen...so the chances of missing on your dish is very remote On a whole, it's a must visit if you are looking for the genuine south indian food, though the waiting time during weekends is a show stopper sometimes.",Rated 4.0,17,30,??

(Pongal is a South Indian version of khichdi) The parantha kurma is also yummy. Try their ghee roast dosa if you love crisp dosa. The only con is that a lot of the items are over by 9 pm..including the pongal :( so get their early,Rated 3.5,20,57,??

Impressive? The way they take orders on their machines. My technology love blossoms to it's fullest when I see restaurants being so efficient & savvy. Ambience? Simple and hygienic. Staff? Friendly What's bad? There's always waiting here, so be prepared for that. Also the place has been designed to accommodate as many people as possible so you'll have strangers sitting absolutely next to you (though on other table joined with yours).

I had a terrible experience when I went to this place the first time, but looking at the positive reviews here on Zomato, I decided to give it another shot. This place has done the improbable - manage to piss me off, twice in two visits, though I think of myself as a customer not hard to please. I don't have any complaints from the food; it's wonderful. The service is at the other extreme. There is a complete lack of courtesy right from helping you to a table to taking your order and getting the food. On my latest (and obviously last) visit, the waiter gave me the ugliest look when I asked him to shift us to another table, which was before our food arrived, and went on to refuse this request with the argument that we shouldn't waste time in moving tables. At this moment, I should have taken his advice of not wasting time and left the wretched place, but stayed as my family was along and they were famished. Needless to say, I won't ever be heading back there again.",Rated 1.0,1,99,??

Ordered my favourite appam with coconut milk, roast masala dosa and parotta with subzi added up with fresh lime soda. The food as usual was very delicious and high quality. Not a place where you can sit for long and eat at your ease as people are always waiting outside in great numbers. One thing is for sure..Saravan Bhawan will never disapppoint anyone and has a big menu with lots of options.One thing that didnt appeal to us was that we were offered soda, lemon juice and sugar juice and had to prepare the fresh lime soda on our own.

Vasundhra Gupta,"Rated My group of college friends and I came here for a birthday treat, with a few of them skeptical about having authentic south Indian food. We walk in and our stomachs are grumbling crazily from the rich aroma the cozy restaurant is filled with. We ordered a variety of things, from a range of dosas to the enormous platter (NOTE: is definitely not for one person). Truth be told, it doesn't matter if you're being served in everyday steel plates and cutlery, because this place teaches you what GOOD food should taste like, shows you the way you should be served with humbleness and warmth, and ofcourse, this place teaches you the definition of simplicity. Without worrying too much about the materialistic fancies, I really appreciate Saravana Bhavan for being hygienic and a pleasure to feast at! The fun part of the experience was the second helping of sambhar being served in beer mugs, which my friends became a big fan of! We all walked out unanimously agreeing that this place was a DELIGHT. The only downfall for which I reduce half a point is that the place has been discovered by those near and far, so you'll have to stand in a queue for HUGE amounts of time before you get your turn. So don't go if you're starving. But again, it's worth the wait! :)",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Samarth Verma,Rated The name was heard a lot. So i finally found a chance to vist. Entry normally takes a time during weekends as you have to wait for your turn because of the crowdyness here.

Now, I know the specialty is something else, but since everyone knows that South Indian fare here is lip-smacking, we decided to try one of their 'Fantasies'. And yes, it did justice to that name. Rich, lovely texture, fresh cherries on top: absolutely divine! Kara Dosai, Onion Masala Dosa, Medhu Vadai, Filter Coffee: No need to even mention that every item was an answer to why this place is still a legend. I personally liked Kara Dosai the best. Lovely tangy-spicy filling in a crispy yet light dosa, delicious! Filter Coffee? Coffee lovers, do not miss this! Yes, this is Dev Anand of the culinary world. Justifiably Evergreen.

Having proudly etched their name among the who's who in the culinary world, Saravan Bhavan dishes out the best in terms of quality and class. North Indians and of course South Indians flock to it in hoards and you will always find long queues and waiting lists of people during peak hours. A thoroughbred vegetarian place, it is spotlessly clean and upholds its standards in hygiene, service, and quality of food. Hearty thalis, idlis, vadas, all the dosas, uttappams, kesari, are the superstars of the menu. And all this will never be complete without washing them down with the filter kaapi!

The taste of food is much better than regular south india restaurants like sagar ratna, and the taste is more authentic. They also have dishes like iddiyayam, aapam etc on their menu which generally other restaurants lack. I would recommend trying mini tiffin, panchvartan uttapam, dahi vada and do try one of their ice cream sundaes. Obviously there are some drawbacks...usually the restaurant is jam packed and you have to wait for some time to get a table, the condition being worse on weekends.

The food was quite good no doubt and had a standard....but not as extraordinary as is hyped to be (there are other places serving equally or almost as good food).....we had ordered what we generally order at a south indian place; idli-sambhar, medu vada, rawa masala dosa (they do not have the option of mysore masala dosa), onion and tomato uttapam....gulab jamun for dessert and filter coffee which is a must for me....:) everything tasted fresh, hot and good...including sambhar and chutnies....:) gulab jamun could have been softer.....filter coffee had the taste and the kick...:) service was quick, i think they were hurrying their guests a bit but no let down on courtesy really..hygiene was a big plus....prices are reasonable...ambience is good again, wooden furniture, well lit, had a big display counter for sweets and savouries, a little cramped for space but i'm not complaining....... I definitely think more visits are on cards for me....so next up i want to try....parotta, rawa idli, lemon rice, some sweets (mysore pauk, ladoo, halwa) and banana chips.....

The dosa is good. Probably among the top 20% of the ones you've had. But why so much hoopla around it? It is a big chain and all but the taste is hardly remarkable. (OK. I'll confess. I've stayed in Bangalore and I just can't find a better dosa than what I had at MTR and Vidyarthi Bhavan.) Also, when I order cold coffee at such an outlet, I'd expect it to be made out of the filter coffee extract but what I was served here was the typical cold coffee made with instant coffee.

Rohan Pratap Singh,"Rated Arguably the best place to eat South-Indian food in the city. Sarvana Bhavan is an out and out South-Indian Delight. Right from their services to menu everything exudes South-Indian culture to it. First of all one advice if you are planning to go there on a weekend either book your table in advance or you may have to face a long waiting list. I have been to a lot of family dinners to this place and we always come out smiling. The icing on the cake is it doesnt make a hole in your pocket. The food is tasty and quick service is provided on whatever you order. The South-Indian thali, Rawa Masala Dosa, Paneer dosa and the mini-idli dipped in sambhar are must tries on the menu. Also if you want to try something different try Appam and the mix uttapam. The rasam and sambhar they give is just mouth-watering to say the least.

Though many a people and my friends appreciate it but if you are into having spicy foods, then this place is surely a hell for you spice lovers. Had to wait outside for getting seats but still I don't understand why people praise this place a lot.I have eaten a lot of dosas from other places but if authentic south Indian food tastes like this then I am scared how are some of my cousins and friends are surviving there!!!!In nutshell, spice lovers please don't torture your taste buds here and if you are into eating that no salt no chilly food, you might end up liking this place a lot.So the choice is yours!!!",Rated 2.0,8,54,??

Both tasted great. The service is quick and the food is fresh. Overall its good value for money. My tip - 1. Those who are used to north Indian flavors in south Indian food might not be fully satisfied. 2. Reach before 1 pm to avoid queues at lunch time.

The only bad part of the whole experience was the first scene of crowd waiting outside the hotel. With some courage I also got my name noted down in the waiting list and after that everything went fairly well. The entry for the crowed was being managed very well and luckily my number came within 15-20 minutes. We sat on 2nd floor. The ambiance was good and a light aroma of authentic south indian food was there. We requested to replace poori's of thali with chapatis, which they did without any problem. Rasam was mouth watering and better than buttermilk. Kara dosa was somewhat close to butter masala dosa, but was a bit more crisp and evenly stuffed. We asked for vegetable dosa also, which was not available at that time... so we replaced it with another kara dosa. Falooda kulfi was infact something like fruit cream but was good.

Swati C,"Rated My entire life my acquaintance with South Indian tiffin food like dosa, idli etc has been mostly through Udupi or Andhra restaurants. The two exceptions would be the late lamented Madras Hotel in CP and the original South Indian Hotel in Karol Bagh both serving Tamil style dosas, vadas and idlis. Both I liked a lot more than my 3-4 meals at Saravana Bhavan. Clearly there's something l'm missing about this place - because it is wildly popular in Chennai so they must be doing something right with respect to Tamil food. What really gets my goat is how stingy they are with chutneys and sambhar. Makes me really miss the generosity of Madras Hotel's unlimited chutney and sambhar refills and service with a smile. Also, Madras Hotel used to have a women's only section where you could sit undisturbed without the prospect of two strangers plonking themselves on your table and staring at you through your meal because that's just the way things are.",Rated 3.0,51,404,??

Karan FoodFanatic,"Rated South indian food is generally synonymous with sambhar and that is probably the heart and soul of south indian dishes. Saravana bhavan is an icon for all those south indian restos out there and it serves up some really good quality food. Be it their dosa, idly,vada or uttapam, everything just somehow manages to give you real authentic flavour. The entire ambiance that is created,along with some good quality food gets a bookmark from me in the book of good south indian food stuff. The service is just about ok, it takes a while sometimes but i reckon we should ignore it as that time lag is definitely compensated by their food stuff. However,i am not very happy with their coconut chutney as i have had better chutneys elsewhere.

Apoorv Mahalwar,"Rated Saravana Bhawan is the Mecca for south Indian food lovers. This is the best way to sum up the food here at Saravana Bhawan. Everything from the Dosai's (this is how it is written in the menu) to the sweet dishes is very awesome. Among the dosai's, the ghee masala dosai and the butter masala dosai are a real treat. The flavour of these dosai's is very different and these are must haves here at saravana. The mini idlies and the onion vadas are a real treat too. My personal favourite at saravana is the south Indian parotta. The closest north Indian relative of it is the lachcha parantha. It is served with an awesome poriyal which is delicious and well balanced. Among the sweet dishes, Basundi is a must have dish. It'll be too hard to resist for sure if it suits your taste. I would like to suggest that you should go and try something else apart from the dosai's and idli's. I am not saying that they are not good or something like that. But try something different for sure too. The ambiance, the staff and the service are all superb. You wont have a bad experience in these categories for sure.

Ardhya Bhatt,"Rated Good food, but ive had better. To start with the waiting scene was absolutely hilarious. The waiting time crossed the open time of the restaurant. It had worse scene than the Indian Railways Ticket counters. Finally I had to tell them that I'm here with two NRIs (Who actually were two random college friends trying to make up with accents supporting my back)... And they let us in (We got our level uplifted in trolling ain't it?) Anyways. We went in..got ourselves seated. Went for ordering food. Another funny thing, a south Indian restaurant DOESN'T serve rice? Like... Come on dude... What? And even Rasam was over... This was the first restaurant ive seen which RUNS OUT of food. The idli was delicious, Dosa's were dipped in ghee, Sweet was not so sweet and coffee was nice. Over all I would say if you haven't been to Mumbai's Cafe Madras this MIGHT delight you (After all who eats south Indian in the finest north Indian city eh?) Cost for 3 is 1,000 bucks (wth....) Over Rated I would say.",Rated 3.5,305,1387,??
Ruhaan Je,"Rated I have lived in Tamilnadu for a few months and honestly, I didn't care about Sarvanna Bhavan much around that time. In Delhi, however, I can't get enough of it. I find myself here on most weekends. Coming straight to the point- Idiyappam (rice noodles served with veg korma), malli rice (coriander rice) along with the usual hits- uttapam, dosai, are my favorites here. Most dishes come with gunpowder chutney, in case you dish doesn't have it, ask for it. Badam Halwa, Filter coffee, watermelon juice are some of the other things i love here. The food is tasty, service is fairly quick even on the busiest day. On weekends and some evenings, to get a table here involves waiting in a queue for anywhere between 10-30 mins. Delhi being Delhi, people crowd up outside the gate, they argue to be let in first, they announce their own and others pedigree and so on. Sarvanna Bhavan, might want to invent a way of avoiding this ruckus at the entrance. The ambience itself is pretty simple. This is not the place where you will take your first date. If you love south indian vegetarian food or want to try something beyond aaloo, paneer and / or pasta, do bring your family here :)",Rated 4.5,28,71,??

Gurjot Singh,"Rated Well, the hype about sarvana bhavan as the best south Indian restaurant must be among a large proportion of folks but in my point of view it fails to be the top score grabber in its respective cuisine ! The rawa masala dosa was a complete delight to my palate . the chutney had the authentic flavors too! Unlike the other big south Indian joints out there in the city, you actually have to pay here for every extra sambhar you order! Not only I thought that its a good way to make good money but also the small portion of sambhar in 1 serving would automatically compel your inner foodie to ask for more! I really didn't find onion uttapam good in taste! Well it was completely devoid of salt and failed to impress! The vada is comparatively smaller in size as what u get at other South Indian restaurants! I wasnt really pleased by looking at that! The only thing which lifted my mood at the end was the badam halwa! It was great in taste but again the problem was the portion! I ate it all in just 1 bite which forced me again to order another one! A very crowded place indeed and the waiters work here in a complete haywire manner! Which was not a very good sight for me!

My all time favourite is 14 mini idlis with sambhar and ghee. 14 idlis dipped in tasty sambhar along with coconut chutney..its just mouth watering and absolutely delicious. All its dosas are quite nice but my fav is inion rava masala dosa and plain paper masala dosa. Uttapams and vadas too are good but its more famous for the idli and dosas.

Vatsla Rohit,"Rated This place was on my wishlist for a long time, finally wen there yesterday. I have heard a lot about long waiting time to have meal here, so i called them in advance to know how crowded it is. Being a weekday the attendant told its not that crowded today. Well to my surprise on a weekday also it was full. Luckily we got a table of four on arrival & we dint have to wait for our turn. Now if you ask about ambience, looks like a normal south indian restaurant. Nothing catchy about the decor. They have 3 floors, ground floor is sweets section, if you just want to have a scoop of icecream or want to try authentic south indian sweets like alwa, you can sit here and enjoy your sweets or you can buy something to take home. About food, they serve lipsmacking south indian dosa's. They have masala dosa, ghee roast, onion masala dosa, coconut dosa etc. And some special dosa's. We ordered thali, onion masala, butter masala and karai dosa. Karai dosa has filling of fried potato n onion, n it tastes delicious. Thali has many vegetables like aviyal, bringal, sambhar, rasam etc to be tasted with poori and rice. Thali includes curd and sweet too. Thali is a must have if you visit here. As it has many south indian veggies. About the service, well service is fast. They use a PDA device to take orders so order comes in around 10 mins max. Being overcrowded, the place is quite noisy. Otherwise everything else is good. All in all, a good south indian junction to have authentic south indian food. Try to visit on weekday!",Rated 4.0,53,118,??

Even on Sunday morning, it had huge rush which could be due to Raahgiri Day being held in CP and people rush to breakfast soon after Raahgiri is over. As it is one of the few restaurants that open early in CP even on Sunday, rush will increase with Raahgiri getting popular in Delhi. Even though there is huge waiting list, it gets cleared easily within 15-20 min depending upon your luck. Ambience is ok. Waiters are quick to take orders and service is pretty good. Sittings are cramped and close by but still comfortable. We ordered Masala Dosai, Medu Vada. They were really good and vadas were fluffy and soft. Sambhar and Chutneys were so far the best we had in Delhi. Sambhar had lots of vegetables which made it taste great. Pricing is bit on higher side though.

With the south indian restaurant located in the heart of one of the happening places of Delhi aka CP. Easy to locate as you will always find a queue standing outside the restaurant waiting for their turn to settle down and enjoy the delicious south indian food, just on a walking distance from Rajiv chowk Metro Station. The restaurant is in a multi storey building in the outer circle of CP. Having sitting arrangement on all the 3-4 floors. Ambience of the place is nothing very special but it's good, service is a bit slow might be due to the large number of people keep on hitting the place. Had been there with my brother as he was keep on telling the Big size dosa story of this place, so i decided to check out what the fuss is all about.As soon as you settle down the service person will put up a paper in front of you having the details of all the branches Sarvana Bhawan have across the world.Till the time your order will be served to your table you can have a look to them. We had orderedDahi Vada as the starter and Masala Dosa in the main along with Golden Fantasy as the dessert. Masala Dosa served on the Banana Tree leaf along with Sambhar and a couple of chuttney's was really huge in size as compared to other ordinary South Indian Food points, but the stuffing of mashed potatoes wrapped up in the Dosa base was moreover the same what you will find everywhere, nothing special except for the size in their Masala Dosa but overall the taste was good.Golden Fantasy was good with perfect amount of sweetness, cherries and fresh cream on top of it.Dahi Vada was the thing i had never tasted before anywhere, and tried it as a experiment, which comes out very quite well as a mix tangy and sweet flavor combo tastes really good.

Shafina Segon,"Rated Every great story starts with a bang!! So did Sarvana Bhawan!! They still serve great food, I must say. no complaints there. But what i do not understand is over pricing of food items that are served. a few things that i have constantly observed over the years that i have been to this place are as follows: 1. The rasam is over salted!! Please do something about this. 2. The amount of oil used in dosas and other recipes is erroneously huge! Please cut it down. 3. Can you get your staff to smile and not be so rigid in saying no on the face of the customers? this is Delhi and delhites love to be pampered!! Please!! 4. Could the cleaning lady not stand on your head and circle around you while you eat? it is not Chennai restaurant - where one dosa is Rs 20. this is connaught place where one dosa is about 80 plus rupees. so when we pay for it, we would like to enjoy it too!! 5. I have no idea why in the mini tiffin, one maida uncooked dry roti has been included with salty daal?? it just doesn't make any sense!! please bring the earlier mini tiffin back!! I still am in love with this place but change is the only constant in life and i would love to see them innovate a little bit",Rated 4.0,7,27,??

Nis,"Rated Saravana Bhavan - It is one place that I know like the back of my hand. There are some places that are a part of our growing up , and this one of them for mine. THIS PLACE HAS THE BEST SOUTH INDIAN FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD IN DELHI. 1) To begin with , there is a huge waiting in this place , be it 12 pm or 8 pm. ( which is worth it). 2)The service is really fast and efficient. 3) it has a very fast-food joint kind of a feeling. so it is a good place if you are looking for a quick bite. 4) it has a huge array of options - a) its sambhar is the bomb ! I usually end up having 3 servings of it alone. b) the chutneys are to die for - specially the green one and the gun powder masala they serve with idlis is delicious too. c) rasam is served hot and is very refreshing . idlis are really soft and delicious. the dosas are the typical long ones and have a lot of variety. my favourite one is the standard masala dosa but the paneer dosa , ghee paper masala dosa are nice too . d) boiled version of dosa -appam - is also cooked nicely . It is very light , not at all heavy to eat . so you can opt for it if you don't want to go for heavy dosas. e) the fresh juices are also very refreshing and should be definitely tried. f) in the end , don't forget to try coconut barfi for the dessert. :)",Rated 4.5,12,13,??

I found the Janpath outlet a bit better quality wise though this one was not poor by any means, ambience was on par in both the outlets. One thing is for sure that after trying their dosa's, I don't even entertain to spend any money or time on any other dosas. Coconut rava masala dosa is hand's down my favorite! And paneer dosa is great too..and their unforgettable chutneys, those all are just bloody brilliant and on top of that their service is amazing! We also tried their uttapam this time around but that was lackluster in front of the dosas. Their sweets dishes are first class too..especially the soft hot gulab-jamuns!

The menu have all the good south indian dishes which u still cannot manage to get in other south indian restaurents.The food makes up for the wait and you end up eating more then planned, all in the budget and very economical.

Or, start with rasam and paapad and move on to the mini idlies (that comes with a dash of desi ghee). Though heavy with a large dose of desi ghee, the mysore ghee is worth a try. Pair the food with a glass of freshly-squeezed juice - have the refreshing pomegranate juice or fresh sweet lime juice. Finish off the meal with a cup of South Indian filter coffee.

Half Thalli Full,"Rated My dad and I had breakfast here this past Sunday. And even though we were at the restaurant pretty early, it was almost full. This goes on to speak volumes of the popularity of the restaurant and also south Indian as a good breakfast choice. The decor is typical of south Indian restaurants, with simple plain interiors and like some south Indian restaurants, has a fresh fruit counter too. The service again is typical, fast and efficient. However the order taking process in pretty high tech, with the orders being taken on digital devices which directly and immediately place the order in the kitchen, as soon as it is punched in. A couple of things i would like to mention, the juice is served in a miserly manner, the glass is barely half full. Also any place that charges extra for sambar and chutney sort of stands out like a sore thumb. The sambar and chutneys were pretty great though. Anyway, we ordered the following: 1) Sambar vadai: Two small vada's and two small bowls of sambar. The vadas were crisp and fresh. 2) Rava masala dosai: The dosa was nothing great.

Neelav Samrat De,"Rated Whenever I am in Chennai I visit the Saravana Bhawans. They are located all over town. You have the upscale restaurant near Krishna Sweets and you have the others which are non AC and you order and stand and eat. So I visited the Saravana Bhawan in Delhi as I had Southey pangs recently. I did not go for the regular dosas or idli or uttapam or vadas. So I went straight for the Saravana special thali. It had 7 items from the dry and gravy type curries, rasam, sambhar, 4 puris and a bowl of white rice along with payasam. Offcourse, you had accompaniments like curd, papad, chutney of tomato, and mixed pickle. My comment- all thalis taste the same. Be it Chennai, Delhi or Mumbai. So my rating- Food-3 Ambience-2.5 Service-3.5 Monotonous taste- 4 Value for money-4 Even if you order other ala carte items, the taste could be a tad different here and there. That's it. Nothing more nothing less. Yes, the thali is a huge affair so go on an empty stomach if you want to be consume everything easily.

Vridhachalempillay Subramaniam,"Rated Dear Managers of SARAVANA BHAVAN in CP., NEW DELHI. I wish to whole heartedly record my deep appreciation of your Services in all departments. 1. I go regularly to collect weekly stock of snacks and sweets from your Restaurant in "" P "" Block in New Delhi CP area. On 17th of May after collecting the snacks and sweets in two carry away cartons I rushed out to engage an Autorickshaw to travel all the way to Subroto Park in the Delhi Cantt. area. In that process I lost or misplaced my Rayban Googles. On reaching home I was terribly upset. My wife suggested to me to ring up the Telephone number given in the receipt. I gave my complaint. I had lost all hopes of getting it back. Last SUNDAY we were there as a Family for a dinner. I spoke to Mr. T.S.SRINIVASAN, ONE OF THE FLOOR MANAGERS. He checked up the register of Lost and Found Notebook and my name and telephone was there recorded. He brought it and handed it over to me. Everyone was pleasantly surprised at my good fortune. I thanked him profusely and promised to record my deep appreciation of the Values of honesty in SARAVANA BHAVAN. 2. I want to add a humble suggestion : On crowded week end days, please follow the TOKEN System and Electronic-MOBILE- Contact system to avoid chaos and confusion and misery due to anxiety of Customers.

As per my experience best time to have food there is in the evening 7-8 since u will find minimum rush in these hours plus u would be able to enjoy your meal pretty comfortable. Avoid this place in the lunch hours only because of high footfall in these hours. I'm not sure but it seems that this restaurant has a parent branch in Chennai as Saravana Stores.

It was late and we were hungry, we were confused about the restaurants when suddenly my French friends came up with the name, ""Saravana Bhawan"". I had never heard that name before and it seemed like a boring restaurant, i was further disappointed when my friends told me that it was a veg restaurant, since i am a hardcore non veg :D. Though i was not really interested, i went along just to try it once. But we lost our way, as my friends forgot the block where it was. We walked for almost half an hour to reach the place, lol .. When we reached the restaurant, it was already full, the queue was long and i got lil irritated for being made to wait for a veg restaurant and while i was trying to get in into the fast joint nearby, our turn to enter came all of a sudden... Atlast, we entered, went to the next floor and ordered for our foods, truly a long menu, all veg :P... Since we were around 8 guys, we ordered lots of foods, different varieties of dosas and other many food items and ended the diner with deserts... The food was real gud and the Dosas were the best i've ever tasted. Everyone was satisfied and the price was decent too.. It was crowded but it didnt mattered much since the food was gud. The only thing we didnt liked was the drink, masala milk or something, which one of my friend wanted to try out, which no one could finish, lol and yeah i didnt knew the reason why the waiters were starring a lot while we were eating :D :P.. In the end I ended up surprised about how these guys, who were from France, for whom the place was more new knew about this decent veg restaurant while i didnt, even after residing in the city for almost 4 years.. Anyways i would considering visiting the restaurant soon again.. :)",Rated 3.5,9,30,??
Vivasha Govinden,"Rated My very first review on Zomato and it can't belong to none other than Saravan Bhavan. Saravana Bhavan is for me , personally a second home. I still remember I ended up there by coincidence on my 19th birthday.I was all thrilled to see Tamil written everywhere. Since then, I've been a regular customer. To be frank, I go there, not for the food but for the atmospher; but nonetheless, the food is amazing. I know the menu by heart. Starters: There is no better starter than the onion vadai. The first thing the waiters will tell u when you order a plate of onion vadai is that it will take 15 mins to get ready. But it's totally worth the waiting! The only issue I have with is that you get only two vadai for 100rs. But, still, it's the best vadai I've ever eaten! Main course: (1) If you are more of a 'rice' person, I would recommend the QUICK LUNCH, which unfortunately is available only from 10am to 3 pm. (2) The thali is another very good option. I find it too filling for one person. But, I have often seen people finishing it all by themselves. I recommend the puri+ rice option over the only rice option. But that is a personal choice though! (3) All the dosais are good! There is only one that I do not like, the vegetable dosai. But the rest are just awesome. North Indians do like the paneer dosa a lot. And, something amazing that is unique to saravana bhavan is the ghee paper roast dosa. It is huge when it comes. Just huge! What makes Saravana Bhavan dosa unique are the chutneys. My favourites are the coriander one and the tomato one. (4) Mini tiffin is the best option if you want to have a variety of all southindian food. You get idlis, dosai, rava khichadi, rava kesari in only 105 rupees. I personally believe that's the best deal they offer. Beverages: Some people like the sweet lassi, others the lime soda. I am usually fie with the water they give ;) The coffee is a must-try item though! And I often tell the waiter to do the process of cooling the coffee in front of me :) Icecreams: SARAVANA BHAVAN has one of the best icecreams I have ever tasted!!! Try the banana scoop all by itself. The wild strawberry along with the chocolate scoop is a killing combination. The chococrunch and the badam bonanza are good choices too! Out of all my saravana experiences, there is only one dish I didn't like.. it was the south indian parotta. But that I had tried in Chennai, I never dared try it here in CP. And all of the above recommendations are based on the saravana bhavan found in cp, p-13, near Nalli Silks, just adjaent to Mc Donalds! Have a nice time in my second home. And if you are a kanda sashti kavasam fan like me, go at 6pm. They play it at that time. Listen to it with a south indian coffee in hand. You feel you are in TN :)",Rated 5.0,7,10,??

It gets even more amusing when you see a rack of people standing outside a VEGETARIAN restaurant, that too a south indian one and in the hardcore north indian city, Delhi.

I love southern Indian cuisine ranging from andhra to Kerala. you judge a punjabi restaurant by its dal makhni, i judge a south indian restaurant by its sambhar. Here, it is the best you can ever get and with that consistency. Food is light, clean, simple but full of flavours. After all it is the most flavourful cuisine of the country. I go there any time, whenever i feel like, breakfast, lunch or whatever. Desi ghee podi idli, onion uttapam, rava masala and all are of prime taste and quality. Rava kesri is so yummy.

When all this walking makes me hungry - one of the reliable eating spots on days I stick to only vegetarain fare is Saravana Bhavan in CP. I usually stick to the mini meal or the mini tiffin option in the mornings as they are good enough to satiate hunger and we also get to taste a little bit of every thing.

Ashish Gautam,"Rated Over a thousand ratings and still the average is above 4, this place deserves a try even after considering the fact that I don't usually like south Indian. Prime location in the heart of City makes it a regular visit by a large number of people. Three big floors all dedicated to dining gives this bhavan a huge capacity. But still in reviews I have seen complaining people that they had to wait a considerable time to get a table for them. But today in eve it was quite deserted with one floor fully empty. The real reason was that crowd here increases exponentially after 7 PM. The ambiance was very light, sober and classy. Lighting was quite bright and in whole the environment comes out to be very suitable for families. The staff was also very pleasing and assists you well with the order. The menu is very widespread with a majority of space occupied by sweet items, which is not a usual thing in any south indian joint. We ordered 14 mini idlis with sambhar, Vegetable dosa, panchavarne uttapam, medhu vadai, buttermilk and cold coffee. Order takes some acceptable time to come but is really worth the wait. Vegetable dosa was average with lightly cooked vegetable stuffing in the dosa. Same average remarks for idli, very average. Uttapam was great which consisted of 5 mini uttapams of different mixes i.e coconut, tomato, mango, pea and cauliflower. Each one was very different and the dish in whole was highly pleasing and no doubt, TASTY. Vadas were crispy and soft and quite above the line of average rating. Buttermilk as usual refreshing and gives a nice treat to your belly. Cold coffee was average and seemed low keeping in mind its price. Sambhar is good but chutneys disappoint. In all the food was better than average with very light spices and more stress is kept on keeping the food very sober and light. Still i will say Carnatic Cafe serves best south Indian in Delhi NCR but this is a really close competition. The bill for all this stuff was Rs 652 which was very reasonable. On a final verdict this place can be tried for its quality food and nice dining experience. My Rating: 1. Food: 3.5/5 2. Ambiance: 4/5 3. Service: 3.5/5 4. Value of Money: 4/5 neverknowsbest.in",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Saif Ali,"Rated Enakku idhu romba pidikkuthu. Sarvana Bhavan is a place of worship for the lovers of South Indian food. Serving the most authentic dishes, they really give the real taste of Southern parts of India. The maddening crowd speaks for the popularity this restaurant has gained since its inception. The dishes are amazingly delicious, and they are prepared according to the conventional methods. The combo meals like the Mini Tiffin allow you to taste a variety of dishes in small portions. Ghee Pongal, Kesari Bhaat, and Uttapam are some of the dishes that will make you salivate for months. The filter Coffee is another option on the menu that will please you to the core. The range of Namkeen available at the Cash Counter is irresistible, and makes you addicted if you have a habit of munching. Verdict : Please go and taste a piece of Heaven in Sarvana Bhawan.......

ANUPAM GOEL,"Rated Went there last Sunday with my college time buddies. The menu offered much variety, which made a bit difficult for us to choose. Unknown with the dishes, we tried our luck by ordering onion and coconut uttpam and iddiyapum with side dish. Uttpam was delicious and it was served along with 4 different chutnies( rai, coconut, tomato and green) and sambhar. The chutnies added flavor to the already tasty uttpam. The second dish was iddiypum with side dish. By side dish I thought it will be some sweet dish but it was a sort of sabzi. Iddiyapam was not that good, or I would say that it was not my types. Avoid offering it with side dish. Plus more interesting thing I saw there was weight measuring machine, do check yours ;) Service was good, and the ambiance will surely give you the south India's feeling.

Vikram,"Rated The real secret of getting absolutely fabulous food at saravana is..... Timing!! If u visit at a time when u don't see that hungry queue fighting hard to get inside, you r most likely to get very high quality South Indian food. However the chefs at saravana are not the ones who can handle performance pressure. Going during the peak hours u can be rest-assured, that the quality of the food will be inferior. Even the fruit juice that they serve seems bland and watery. And, when it comes to service, one dosent have much expectations to begin with. However, the waiters stare is worth a mention. It's rally crazy how the waiters keep looking at your plate all the time, and it's kinda fun to eat slowly and seeing their faces go red. But u can't blame them, there's that hungry quarrelsome queue waiting outside. But!! U do get great food there... U just need to be wise about when to go.",Rated 4.0,15,39,??
Abhijeet Yadav,"Rated Truly the best place to grab a bite to eat in CP. Super clean place, super nice feel, super food (do try the sundaes). Though the menu's strictly vegetarian, but you'll never get disappointed with the service and the taste. Though i'm not a particular fan of south indian cuisine, i am a big fan of sarvana bhavan. Recommended for any who go to CP, though you may have to wait for 30mins-an hour near meal times.",Rated 5.0,5,51,??
Aditya Goel,"Rated I honestly cannot believe that I havent reviewed Saravana Bhawan any sooner. I have lost the count of how many times I have been here (Thanks to a South Indian Food Lover ex). There are two outlets of Saravana Bhawan and this one located in P-Block nearby Nalli Showroom, Regal Cinema, My Bar Lounge and Restaurant, Hanuman Mandir and the list goes on. Saravana Bhawan is and always will be my backup plan always. Why? Consistently delicious food and pocket friendly prices. So for all you misers out there, who want to have good food in a restaurant without burning a hole in your pocket, take note please. I would strongly suggest the Paneer Dosa because its delectable, unlike any other dosa you have ever tasted and really pleasing to your palate. Curd Vadai, Masala Dosai, Onion Rava Masala Dosai, Vegetable Dosa and probably everything on the menu can be ordered and it will be high on taste, quality, hygiene and presentation. Now that I have mentioned presentation, they serve dosas and utthappams in these white plastic plates with banana leaf and inbuilt bowls in them which are reminiscent of my childhood memories. A special mention goes to Panchavarna Utthappam which basically is 5 small utthappams with different ingredients (My bad memory wont allow me to write down what those are but I remember 3 of them were Coconut, Tomato and Peas). Fresh Lime is more of a DIY here, theyll serve you with a glass, bottle of soda, lemon juice and salt but beware while mixing it, I have spilled it a lot of times because of the reaction between soda, lemon and salt. Other thirst quenchers worthy of try are Pineapple and Sweet Lime Juice, Butter Milk and Banana, Mango and Pista Shake. If you are fan of South Indian Filter Coffee, youll love the coffee here and even if you are not a fan of it, try it once. Now the most important factor- If you are thinking of visiting Saravana Bhawan during lunch hours/dinner hours or during holidays and you dont have enough time on your hands, do not. The waiting time here sometimes stretches more than 1.5 hours (Bummer, Eh?). One thing has always bewildered me here, the service staff. On some days they are so polite and treat you like royalty and on other days they will give you an unfazed look everytime you ask them for anything. You: Bhaiya order aane mein kitna time lagega? Serving Staff: Meh! But still that shouldnt deter anyone from eating out here and I am quite sure most of you people have been to Saravana Bhawan at least once in your life. Thank you for your time. Cheers and Happy Eating.",Rated 4.0,29,337,??
Nitin Joseph,Rated Lemme just start by saying that if you live in delhi a have a craving for South Indian food via a proper restaurant this is it ! Tad bit higher than the fair price but you won't go home with disappointment. Do try (of course) the masala dosa (4 variety's of chutney are at your taste bud's service). Filter coffee is a must try and the onion rava masala dosa is mouth watering. Even though the service is a bit slow the waiters are polite and ready to answer any question about the food you throw at them! The biggest problem is parking. This is the game changer as I had to pass on the opportunity to eat here several times because of this! Strawberry shake is identical to the thick shake of Haldirams!,Rated 4.0,6,732,??
Supreet Kini,"Rated We stumbled upon Saravana Bhavan really late in the night when roaming around Connaught Place. We initially entered a KFC, and left without really making our minds up as to what we wanted to eat, and walked around the place for like 15-20 minutes aimlessly. All three of us were unsure of what we wanted to eat . One of my friends suddenly had a craving for South Indian food and we decided to go to Saravana Bhavan. Well, Saravana Bhavan is to South Indian food, what McDonalds is to burgers. A large franchise all over the world, my friend was wowing about their masala dosa's. Coming from South India, I like my share of dosa's and vada's too, and considering I hadn't eaten South Indian in like ages, what better place than this to come to. Even at 10PM on a Tuesday night, the place was kinda full. We ordered a masala dosa and one of my personal favorites, an onion uthappam. I was impressed by the uthappam. It was just like how it should be, crisp, well prepared, and without the onions popping out from everywhere. I liked the coconut chutney and required two helpings. The masala dosa could've been better, but the good part was the potatoes were cut in little pieces, unlike it is usually, where they just dump large pieces of potato in the masala dosa. A scan into the sweet section took my glances towards the Mysorepak, probably the greatest sweet prepared by mankind. Definitely going to try it before I leave Delhi in a few days. Update - Tried the Medhu Vada, and was transported to the South. Amazing taste, crispy on the outside, and delicious coconut chutney to go with it. Also had the Rava Onion Masala Dosa and the Ghee Roast Masala Dosa. The potato is a bit less in the Ghee Roast Masala Dosa, but I liked the taste overall. The best part is unlimited servings of chutneys and sambhars!",Rated 4.0,89,527,??

So as soon as I shifted to Delhi for college, which...ahem...was almost a decade back I looked for a authentic South Indian restaurant. Saravana Bhavan was where my search ended. I have been going there all this while (~10yrs!) and they have remained consistent in terms of the food quality and quantity. Pick anything from the menu...it's bound to be good.

And if u still have some space in your belly, cap it all off with a strong, piping hot steel tumbler of filter coffee. Oh and dont forget to order gun-powder chutney separately.

The place is spread over three floors, servers rushing with order books and food, a bunch of cleaners- picking up the empty plates, keeping the place spik and span and a bunch of servers carrying around extra sambhar, chutney, papad, whatever you need! As soon as we seated ourselves, we were presented with a menu card- we ordered a portion of sambhar vada, a masala dosa and and an onion-tomato uthappam. We were presented with water in typical South Indian steel glasses and the food came in pretty quickly. The sambhar-vada came in first along with generous helpings of coconut chutney. The vada was good enough- steaming hot, soft, freshly fried. But it was slightly overpriced considering size of the vadas, and funnily enough, the vada was costlier than the dosa and the uthappam :P The uthappam came in next with sambhar, coconut chutney, green coconut chutney, tomato chutney and gun powder. The uthappam was mind blowing, a little smaller in size than what am used to eating but loaded with onions and tomatoes, super soft, cooked to perfection. Masala dosa came in last- it was like the best one was saved for last. A huge crispy dosa, with the most amazing potato stuffing accompanied by sambhar, coconut chutney, tomato chutney and green coconut chutney. Coming to the sambhar- it felt like I was having the real sambhar after a really long time- it was flawless- great consistency and awesome masala. The same goes for the coconut chutney- it was made out of freshly ground coconut, like the way they used to serve in Sagar Ratna ages ago. And I was having gun powder after oh so long- a friend of mine used to get idlis with gun powder back in school and I had a rush of nostalgia after seeing it along with the uthappam! The server generously gave us another bowl of sambhar and we gobbled it all up. By the time we were done with our meal- we were both full and completely satisfied! The place is very reasonable and a must try for South Indian lovers! :D chompslurrpburp.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The ambience is pretty decent, they mostly have soft music for the customers which forms a relaxing environment for a peaceful get together for families (I went with my family for the first time). The service is good considering the amount of people that flock in here. One can take the metro as it is very convinient to reach there and locating it is never a problem for first timers. The Filter Coffee (best drink on the menu) is highly recommended and the Butter Masala Dosa is my take, all the dishes contain very less oil, so don't worry about the calories! :D Meal for two costs around 400-500 if you have a more than the ""average appetite"" :P",Rated 3.5,63,150,??

I have had the opportunity to indulge in South Indian food across the country and I must say that Saravana's offerings are by far the most superior. Right from the presentation to the sheer taste of each and every item on the menu, the only competition in my opinion comes from a few restaurants in Kochi. I hope some day this group would expand its wings and open up more outlets not only in Delhi but other parts of the country as well.

Anubhav Saxena,"Rated If you ever forget the address, or for the first time you are been to connaught place or you are bad with numbers, no matter whatever your problem be, you will not feel impaired to find 'Saravana bhawan'. The universal tip is, take a round of C.P., the place with longest queue waiting to get in, is your destination. Isn't it simple? I remember it took me 7-8 visits to C.P. to finally prod myself to go and eat at saravana bhavan, the only reason which made me hesitated was the large crowd waiting to barge in.It was a mystic thing for me until I got to eat there finally. The menu is not pretty exhaustive, but is enough to choose from. Lets talk about portion size, it is enough to satiate a general-appetite person. I had classical items, so there is not much to talk about, but since I am here following are my comments over them:- 1.Onion masala dosai: Nice butter flavour, fervent masala(bhaji) and caramelized onion was a perfectly complimenting each other. 2.Idiyappam with side dish: Honestly I am not a big fan of Idiyappam, I feel they were little bland. But from my experience till now, they are supposed to bland so no offence.I associate noodles with spice-laden sauce hahaha,just kidding :P 3.South Indian parotha: An advice to who haven't tasted this dish, you need to develop your taste buds, before liking it.Dont feel awkward if you don't like it in first tasting.Nevertheless it came out exactly what was expected, good layers and brilliant astringent kurma(korma). 4. Badam halwa: This dessert is a winner, nothing can beat it. stay away if you are calorie concious, it is laden with dollops of ghee(clarified butter).In winters it sells like hot cakes due to its medicinal benefits. I have talked to some people who compare it to Dakshin(Sheraton,Saket), but I think it is unfair to compare a two. Dakshin wins when it comes to quality of food and plethora of unique dishes. But we have to understand the constricts of pricing in here. As far as issue of waiting outside is concerned, I feel the 'Bournville' tagline is apt for the food of Saravana bhavan, 'you cant buy it, you earn it' thank you so much for reading,I hope this review will be helpful to some.

Waiting time - Weekends and festive season is terrible. Minimum waiting time - 30 mins. Weekdays its comparitively better. Seating - Good.

Food - I had been in love with the ""14 mini idly sambhar and ghee (worth it)"", the name sounds as if, how big foodie a person would be eating ""14 idlies"" in one go, but the size of the idly is so small, you actually relish having each and every bite. A MUST TRY PREPARATION. Apart from this Butter roast dosai also holds a very good preparation. Dry fruits rava dosai was ok, though i personally felt that the quality of the dry fruit filling, should have been better. Mixed uttapam was just perfect for a change and quiet filling too.

Rohit Dassani (www.RohitDassani.com),"Rated This place might be difficult to find for first timers but its very famous and quite renowned and easily accessible on the outer circle of Connaught Place. The restaurant serves South Indian delicacies from Tamil Nadu and have outlet even outside of India. This outlet comprises of 3 floors and even have a sweet shop in the ground floor. Make sure to reach on time or don't be surprised to find lots of people waiting. The seating arrangements vary from easy chairs to sofa sets. The ambiance is standard and nothing unique to talk about. The waiter's carry PDA devices to take orders and the order is directly send to the kitchen for preparation. We ordered a Masala Dosai (i dont know why they add the 'i' at the end) as it is one of their favorites. The Dosa was soft unlike the usual crispy ones. They had 2 variety of Chutney, one plain and the other one with coriander. I loved the coriander chutney. Also had a tomato based chutney. The sambar was thicker and not very flavorful also the amount of vegetable in it was quite less. Even though it wasn't perfect, I had 2 bowls of sambar with the Dosa. Also ordered a Tomato & Onion Uthappam. The Uttappam was very soft and unlike at other places was made from the Dosa batter than the Sooji batter. This made the Uttappam extra soft. The Uttappam also had a generous amount of curry leaves and green chilli. Again the Uttappam comes with 2 chutneys, 1 tomato chutney and Sambar. The waiter are generous to replenish your sambar bowl every now and then. We also ordered a Fresh Lime Soda. The waiter bought a glass filled with juice of 2-3 lemons, soda bottle and sugar syrup. It was now up to us to see how much sugar we wanted in our Fresh Lime Soda. It was like experimenting on the dinner table. Very unique experience. The outlet is very famous for their natural fruit flavored ice-creams and the menu is filled with Sandaes. Well would love to try it next time. The verdict:- Food/Taste - 8/10 Service - 8/10 Value for Money - 7/10 Quality - 8/10 Ambiance - 7/10 Awesome south Indian food!

Vishal Garg,"Rated Today I was out for a lunch with a friend of mine and we were looking for some place in Connaught Place and then my friend said that lets have south indian food and me being a non-vegetarian was totally against it but he managed to convince me and we went to Saravana Bhavan, located next to Hotel Alka and opposite Rivoli Cinema. To my surprise, there was a waiting for minimum 20-30 minutes but finally we got our table and we sat on the Mezzanine floor. As soon as you enter the restaurant you will feel as in you entered some restaurant in South Indian city owing to the music and ambiance. On your table you will found paper table mats describing the spread of branches they have and I was shocked to see that they have branches all across the world be it UAE, Singapore, London or USA. Coming over to food, we ordered masala dosa and butter masala roast dosa and curd vada and I must tell you this was the best South Indian food I have ever had. Not only the taste but the presentation was superb and seeing the colours on the plate you yourself would want to eat that. They had 3 different chutneys with dosa, one was the normal white coconut chutney, although it terms of taste it was far better than what is being given at other restaurants, second was the green one which was kind of a mint one and was equally good and third one was the red one, totally different from what is given at other restaurants and definitely better than those. The dosas were perfectly crisp and bang on in terms of taste. The curd vada was superb. The softness of vadas and sweetness of curd were perfectly complementing each other. Guys, you should definitely try this one. And in desserts, go for Butterscotch Praline, although I didn't taste because I was over stuffed with my dosa but my friend did and he has recommended this. Guys, overall this is 4/5 and a must visit place for people who are actually bored of going to Sagar Ratna and looking for a change.

Durvankur Surendra Patil,"Rated By Day 2, I was already familiar with my surroundings in New Delhi and most importantly Connaught Place. Before heading for a long day in Noida for the Saturday qualifying of Formula-1, it was imperative to put some fuel in my tank. I had heard a lot about Saravana Bhavan, both from the reviews on Zomato and also from my friends who had travelled to Delhi before. Again, located on one of the blocks of CP, this time it was pretty easy to find this place. It was not because of the popularity, but because me being plain lucky to take the correct exit at Rajiv Chowk Metro. The moment you enter Saravana Bhavan, it is a stark different scene inside. You dont feel that you are in New Delhi anymore, but in some South Indian city, which is buzzing with the language and the aromas of its cuisine. It seems to be an ideal place and choice for people wanting to have a hearty and wholesome meal at any time of the day. Since it was breakfast time for me, I started with their Rava Masala Dosa. In Mumbai, even the best of the South Indian restaurants serve their dishes with Chutney and Sambar only. Over here, I was in for a pretty surprise, when the Dosa came in with Sambar and 3 different types of Chutneys. The Rava Dosa was made perfect, with the right amount of crispiness and holes on its covering. The masala was neat and fresh and exuberated its true flavours. All the 3 chutneys that were served had their distinct taste, which complimented the Dosa well. The accompanying Sambar was hot and fresh and with the exact consistency a Sambar should have. Still with place to fill up my tummy, Idlis seemed to be the right choice to do the needful. Huge, soft and steaming hot; the perfect way to explain the Idlis at Saravana Bhavan. Idlis came with one more chutney, apart from the 3, which was a tad-bit spicy, but just too good to eat your Idlis with. I am always fascinated with restaurants that serve their South Indian dishes on banana leaf, which gives it an authentic feel, if not the taste. After eating a good breakfast, I had to wash it down with a glass of Fresh Lime juice, which was the perfect choice in terms of heat and a gluttonous stomach. The service at Saravana Bhavan is pretty quick and you dont have to run behind anyone for attention. From the time you enter the place till the time you leave, they make sure you have a good time eating. It was nice to see that restaurants now a days take technology seriously and have touch pads to note the orders. My second day breakfast was far better than Day 1s breakfast at Dunkin Donuts.

The Janpath outlet is the most popular one (there are other outlets all across CP and delhi as well) - the serpentine queue outside at any time of the day or evening is standing proof of it. the food is fresh, delicious and served as you would be if u were at a local cafe south of the Vindhyas! Interestingly, the servers have become all tech savvy and they punch in your order in hand held tabs...very cool indeed! :D We ordered - mini tifffin, dahi bada, ghee roasted paper masala dosa and their famous badam halwa which comes completely drenched in gheee....mmmmmmm!!!! Please do not forget to shop for nadus, murukkus, bournvita/horlicks mithai, etc. from the counter downstairs. These snacks and mithais are just as yummy!",Rated 4.0,61,631,??

You will never be disappointed here, fresh steaming hot food is their USP. If visiting first time have their rava masala dosa and medu vadas and end your meal by a cup of original filter kaapi. And if you happen to be their early in the morning, its one of the best places to have breakfast and kick start your day. Please note: At any given point of time you will find all tables full.

Ankush Mohanty,"Rated Saravana Bhavan, opened, primarily to bridge the gap of the non existence of a quality vegetarian restaurant, has paved its way through history since the early beginnings of 1981 in Chennai. However, the Delhi experience is what I am going to talk about here. With its two branches in Delhi (Janpath opened in 2003 and P-Block, CP opened in 2004), one would rarely see any free space outside the entrance to the restaurants with people trying to get a seat. With McDonald's and Side Wok in the same lane, this place has held its own for a long time and none would be able to displace it quite soon. They truly carry forward the meaning of a Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) with the waiters functioning smoothly with a smile on their face. Starting with the Rava Idly (it is like the high end version of our normal idly with peanuts and cashew nuts on top with a healthy dose of curry patta and traditional herbs). The idly was so soft that it would melt in your mouth by the time you bring in sambhar / chutney to the frey. Having said that, you would not mind the absence of any accompaniments as the idly in itself is a complete dish.) We then tried the South Indian Paratha (Initially, I felt quite betrayed by the borrowing of the name tag however; this one did justice to it in its own special way. The paratha is made in circular layers and once you break a piece, you can see the actual threadwork. Served with the vegetable korma, the soft parathas go well alongside the curry which is full of vegetables with a dash of coconut milk). Moving on to the staple dish, the dosa. Ordered a ghee roast plain dosa. I had hoped for a couple of things 1. Crispiness of the dosa 2. The rich flavor of ghee The crispiness was there alright however I was let down by the flavor. The dosa did not have that shiny and glossy appearance which a dosa made in ghee / butter has. The look should have been so tempting that one should be compelled to eat half of it without any side dishes (one should try the Butter Plain dosa of any Sagar Ratna outlet to understand what I mean here) The tomato and the green chutney alongside were vying for my attention and both of them served their purpose of being so rich in flavor, that none of it was left on the plate..! You should go for the masala dosas, they would definitely fare better. They have different types of rice made on different days of the week like Monday (Lemon Rice), Tuesday (Tomato Rice) and so on.. All this and if the bill shows you the figure of around 450, then it is a win win situation..!",Rated 3.5,103,370,??

The big breakfast is not deserving of the title. 4 measly small mushrooms, a wattles hash brown, no condiments or butter, two small precooked sausages, 1 egg, and lacklustre bacon.

Theyoung Bigmouth,"Rated I am a Naivedyam pujari. When it comes to South Indian food, we have always made a trip there. Their South Indian village like ambiance and the dhoti clad servers beat the industrial efficiency of Sarvana Bhavan anyday. But a few days back, we went there with an American professor, who, refused to budge after entering the restaurant. It was 12.40, ten minutes before the official lunch time. So, we could walk in and find seats too. It is a completely vegetarian restaurant, so the menu is limited but you can find almost all veg items on it. There is no Bisi Bele Bhaath here, though. The interiors are like any other south indian place - bare, clean and sparse. The tables are basic and the chairs are not cushioned. But the serving time is less and the food is good. We ordered a parotta, idiappam and kurma, a thali and a mini tiffin. All of them items on the menu were excellent, especially the kesari halwa. But the complimentary rasam and papad were missing (remembering naivedyam) and the rasam that came with the thali didnt have the same kick. At 1.15, when we came out there was the same massive that you see everyday at lunch hour. May be, this is the reason why, the service is so hard pressed. Even before you have finished eating, the woman with the tub will be lurking at your table, ready to pick up the plates. She, actually, asked her two times if she can pick up a plate from the table. But, this is not the place for a lazy meal. You come in eat and go.

Abhishek Naresh,"Rated Vegan in the city of kebabs and non-veg delight ?? .Sarvana bhawan is the place to be. It offers typical south Indian (Tamil) cuisines. The restro is always crowded and one has to wait in a line for entry. But its very quick and will take only 15-20 minutes. The menu offers dosas, vadas, uttapam to thali. The standard thali is really worth every penny. It offers different types of curries. My favorite is the one cooked in coconut gravy. Rice, puris, papad, rasam, sambar, green veg. curry are some of the other thali dishes. If you are in the mood for dosas then must try is ghee roast. Its just insanely delicious. The food is served in dishes with banana leaves, which is a south indian tradition. The restro also includes a sweets section, if you want to just purchase sweets. The special ladoos are really a must have.

Also, chapati and parotta was not available. I ordered the Ghee Paper Dosa which was average but had generous amounts of ghee. The chutneys along with it were bland. The white coconut chutney was not spicy, the sambar was not sour (it was basically plain dal) and the onion chutney (I am assuming that was onion chutney) was rather watery.

Rocky & Mayur,"Rated Rocky's Carnivorous review: 3 / 5 - This chain has some amazing food in Tamil Nadu. In Delhi they fall short of expectation. The Chutneys, Coconut, Tomato Garlic and even the Gunpowder seemed just a little off. Saravana Bhavan, of all eateries should know that a Chutnney can make or break this kind of meal. For me it was broken. The Sambar too was average. The Dosas were decent and the highlight was the Rava Idli's and the Sambar Vadai. The juices are fresh but do ask them to skip adding sugar if you don't like them too sweet. I went there with great expectations, I returned disappointed. Mayurs Herbivorous review: 3 / 5 - If food was a 'Weapon of Mass Destruction' then Sarvana Bhavan would have been a world power. This chain with branches all over the world would not have not have had Delhi as it's capital though. They do a half-decent Ghee Roast Doasa and their Medhu vada is decent but the only thing that hit the mark was the fluffy, piping hot idlis. The eponymous 'S. Indian Filter Coffee' was just average which is shocking if you ask me. AMBIENCE: 3 / 5 - The Air conditioning works well. Its always full and there is always a line outside especially on weekends. The interiors are sparse and basic. Bathrooms could be a little cleaner. SERVICE: 4 / 5 - Extremely polite staff. They are a little impatient and tend to rush but we found them very polite and prompt. The prompt service is a big plus at the eatery. Interesting to see orders taken down and printed out on PDA's. VALUE FOR MONEY: 4 / 5 - A meal for 4 cost us Rs.1200. We all had at least 2 things and a drink each. Good stuff. OVERALL RATING: 3 / 5 - If only the quality was what you get in Chennai. I would be breaking down the doors every day. But it's not. The place has a great location and the constant crowds lead me to believe that they're becoming a little complacent. I hope they pull up their socks, this kind of food is my favorite breakfast in India and I really wish it gets better here, in Delhi.",Rated 3.0,52,1790,??

Ankit Chachra,"Rated After visiting Saravana 4-5 times, the only advice I would like to give is to avoid the place for dinner on a weekend or public holiday. Else you might have to wait for at least 15-25 minutes outside the restaurant. The ambience is pretty decent. The staff is quick and friendly. Service is lightning fast. Five minutes was all it took for them to serve 2 Uthapams. Taste-wise, the Sambar is unmatchable. Uthapams and dosas are very well prepared. The uthapam however, is a bit thin and can certainly be better. Someone fond of authentic South Indian food (like me) should find the quality of food remarkable.

Subham Sarkar,"Rated If you want to have authentic South Indian Dishes in Delhi NCR, this is one of the best and authentic places to get it. Ambiance : The ambiance is of the usual South Indian restaurant with music playing in background. Since having the food was the primary objective, the ambiance fits fine. But if you are planing to spend long hour there, you might not feel it so appealing. Service : Sometimes the rush is too much and you might have to wait a while before you get a table. And as far I know there is no concept of table booking either. But once you are inside the service is prompt. Amazing to see that the attendants are carrying their PDA and taking orders on them and getting the bills printed with the printer hanging from their belts. Order is served prompt. Food Quality : Completely authentic. That should sum it up for most. Its hard to find authentic taste in South Indian restaurants in and around Delhi. And they serve the tastiest and authentic array of South Indian dishes. So far whatever we have tasted have made us happy. Suggestion to Foodies : A must try. Try the sweets corner in the ground floor/basement. Mysore pak is a good one. So are other sweets. Don't go for the shakes or juices. They are not so special. Try some of the following 14 Mini Idli Rice Thali Almost any variety of Dosa (Specially Rawa Dosa and Kara Dosa) Sooji Halwa Ghee Pongal Idiyappam with Coconut milk (If you are into hardcore south Indian dishes) N.B. Some of the items are available only during certain time of the day. So do enquire before ordering. :)",Rated 5.0,21,63,??

The ambiance is great and the crowd was also nice, thanx to its proximity to one of the best locations of Delhi. Even after the ques of waiting people you generally get a place to sit very early and the service is swift. They have two floors in there and yet it remains neck packed all the times. The best dishes are Butter Masala Dosa (which is called Dosai), Badas and coconut uttpam. Their south indian pooris are also worth trying but If you really wish to have South indian pooris then Karnataka Bhawan cantene is just a KM away from it.

Now, being a southy restaurant, if you expect only south Indian visitors all around your table, then you are mistaken... You would find lot of Punjabi and Sikh crowd there.. even foreigners like to sit around and enjoy the south Indian delicacies.... totally a lively and cosmopolitan place... Food , I must say is very good... I guess this is the only place in Delhi that serves appam (which is probably the best item here), experiment with coconut milk Idlies, you can also try Thuvaiyal, kootu or kara kuzabu (i hope i spelled the dishes correct!) once in a while.. You can try their sundaes and ice creams to wash it all down... I think, through all these years, this place has carved a niche for themselves and north Indians love for their south Indian food will keep this place going like this in the upcoming years...

Overall he said it was nothing amazing. I had the Salmon Eggs Benedict which looked amazing, pretty tasty but alas ... somehow a piece of food plastic got in under my salmon as did two large bones. Coffee was great and the staff were friendly and attentive. I mentioned to the waiter about the plastic which he took away but obviously didnt mention it to anyone else as no one knew when I went to pay. I mentioned it to the cashier and she apologised and didnt charge me for that meal which was an appreciated gesture.

Pavneet Singh Chadha,"Rated I went to sarvana bhawan yesterday accompanied by two friends around 4 30 in the evening for a post lunch meal. The walk from metro station can be cumbersome but the experience is worth it.This being my first visit, i was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very welcoming and greeted us as we made our way on to the first floor. The waiter answered some questions i had about the uthapam mixtures in a very matter of factly way. We deliberated for a few minutes and placed the order. I ordered onion tomato uthapam, and the friends ordered onion rava masala dosai and hot idly respectively and 2 fresh lime sodas to chase the food. The order didnt take long, before i could look around and savour the easy listening background music, the food was in front of us. What was immediately striking about the food was the presentation and so many colours on the plate. The white coconut chutney, sambar, the red chutney and the green chutney. A visually appealing meal is a treat for the senses and increases the appetite. Another pleasant aspect was how of they let us make our own sodas with the appropriate mixture of the sugar syrup and soda according to one's liking. The uthapam had just the right amount of onion and tomato,although a little coconut wouldnt hurt. The friend (a regular here and an amateur foodie) who had ordered onion rava masala dosai said ""the taste was amazing"". Its her favourite dish on the menu. I would have liked details from the friend who had ordered hot idly but she was disinterested in food (bad day). To sum up, a nice place to chill on a lazy weekend afternoon. Good food,quiet and quaint,easy music,easy on the pocket,attentive staff and some terrific company.

Frankly, I dont really like the idea of eating at a south Indian restaurant while eating out, but all of my friends insisted and hence i found myself sitting at this overcrowded eatery. Now the Sarvana Bhavan does not offer anything new in terms of the variety of dishes. You have the regular fare of idli's, dosa's, uttapam's etc. We ordered a fixed thali, an onion uttapam, a paneer dosa, a plate of idli and a plate of tamarind rice. I really wanted to try the Appam,the only different thing i found in the menu, but due to some reason it wasn't available. The food was decent, not spectacular, but what i really liked was that it was not very oily.I also liked the service, which was very prompt. If you are a student, you'd find this place a little not so pocket friendly. If you are looking for some decnt south indian food, i'd say this is not a bad place.

The thali was excellent, all the vegs and sambhar rice was good to taste and I could feel as if I was in Chennai for a short time (food wise only, thankfully this place is well cooled:)). For a price of 185 I think the full thali is worth having it as it gives quite a number of veg and sambhar to relish with south Indian rice.

Divanshu Sarin,"Rated Hotel Sarvana Bhawan - Serving Quality South Indian Food from quite a few decades situated at the heart of the city next to a very urban food outlet McD is a heaven for not only South Indians but for everyone from the city . The Scene - A late Sunday evening , cars lined up and people thronging to the gate and a Guy from the Restaurant loudly speaking names of people with very wrong pronunciations. After about 30 minutes we manage to enter and get a table for us and we get a menu to see and then we place our order . The essence of the place is very fresh but the ambience is nothing special. The food is very fresh .. Rava Dosa , Tomato Uttapam , Idli and Medu Vada everything is a must try. I liked the 14 Pcs Idli with sambar and Ghee for around 100rs very awesome. Try their Papad and the sweets are typically south indian. Cost for 2 is under 500rs which is very cheap. The only thing that misses in this outlet is their service , you cannot see smile on anyone's face and it seems they are just doing their job.

Giridhar Pai,"Rated For South Indians either living at New Delhi or visiting it, Saravana Bhavan (SB) is like a slice of home to soothe them about what they might be missing from back home! I have been eating at this restaurant for many years and have seen it grow more popular over the years. That the restaurant boldly chooses to place itself next to McDonald's not just here but at several other locations tell us what the management thinks about itself! Even with menu offerings that are more expensive than at McDonald's next door (and in a city where McDonald's is quite popular), Saravana Bhavan at CP is a crowded restaurant at most times. They seem more than confident of being in any place as they intuitively seem to know that they shall attract customers by their reputation and more improtantly their great food. The menu is long and one will need many visits to get a good idea of the range of food available and to have a taste of most of it. I like their 14 idlis in sambhar with ghee - this is a very filling dish and each of the idlis is one bit size, making it convenient to eat them without having to chop up the idlis like we have to do with the bigger idlis. Their thalis are good too and are recommended for getting a good taste of all that Saravana Bhavan makes. The food at SB is expensive compared to what is generally offered at Udipi restaurants in other cities in India, but I guess the high price of real estate at New Delhi and the air conditioned ambience makes it necessary to price the menu as SB CP has done. The restaurant lists Rava Khichdi and Pongal among its favourites and these are worth a try. The Rava Khichadi is Upma named differently and Pongal is the south Indian equivalent of Dal Khichadi. The thali can be overwhelming for someone not used to south Indian menu or those with a limited appetite. The restaurant offers a Quick Lunch option which has fewer dishes than the thali and also a Mini Tiffin which is a platter of their snacks from which one can choose 4. The waiters are polite and helpful and SB at CP continues the glorious tradition of good food with great service that they have at their restaurants at Chennai.",Rated 4.0,192,815,??

Niharika.Loves.To.Eat,"Rated When I was a child, Saravana Bavan used to be the 'it' place in Connaught Place to eat South Indian food. These days, with Zambar in the Ambience Mall and Sagar Ratna in Ashoka, the whole idea of eating South Indian in a clustered, energetic and hustle- bustle environment has dropped. Restaurants like Saravana Bhavan that owe their popularity to this herd- like ambience have now been sidelined. However, this is not to say that their popularity has dropped and that they have vacant tables.They still are the #1 South Indian restaurant in New Delhi. What adds to their appeal is the pocket friendly and tasty food that they have to offer. Further, they have a variety that I don't get to see in most restaurants serving the cuisine. Appam, for instance is very popular in South India but here in New Delhi not many restaurants serve it. This one does. Conventional dishes like idli, dosa, uttapam and upma are available everywhere in thoughtful varieties; however, Rawa Khichdi and tomato rice are only served in a few places like this one. (Reason # 1) Apart from the food, another appealing factor of this restaurant is that it is centrally located in Delhi which allows crowds from all four corners to visit it. Moreover, it is near the Railway Station which allows busy travelers to have a quick bite. To add to that, foreigners who are busy shopping in Janpath and nearby areas are also seen at this place. This makes the place lively, friendly and cosmopolitan ! (Reason # 2) Saravana Bhavan has been able to maintain its charm all these years and I am sure that even with tough competition from the new generation of other upbeat and fancy South Indian restaurants in the city, it will be able to easily sail through. Must visit.",Rated 4.0,441,6711,??
Rahul Sharma,"Rated Food: 5 Ambience: 3.5 Service: 3 Recommendatory: Yes. Saravana Bhawan is the, albeit debatable, epitome of South Indian food in Delhi. Food: I came about this place around 2 years ago and ever since been a regular. I've tried almost all their dosas and liked every single one. The sambhar is very tasty and, unlike almost every south indian restaurant, is thick and NOT watery!! Love it. The three chutneys are always a thumbs up. Though I've not personally tried anything apart from dosa, idli and uthapam, I've been told that the rest are as good. Ambience: In comparison with it's other competitors like Naivedyam or Carnatic Cafe, Saravana Bhawan's ambience is somewhat ordinary with regular tables, instrumental music, glass/mirror walls and chattering noise. I've been asked to share tables but that is understandable since it is jam packed in the lunch hours. That being said, there is a possibility that you might have to wait outside, despite the two floors of the restaurant. Service: I'm highly dissatisfied with the behaviour of the serving staff. Their indifferent behaviour is very apparent. I have observed them ranting/making fun of people not accustomed to their style. And sometimes the waiter would make you wait when they are called. But despite that the food is always on time and hot.",Rated 4.0,1,0,??

We had appam with side dish which i must say different and very tasty. The side dish was a south indian preparation which consisted of steamed vegetables cooked with south indian herbs and spices. It was thick and tasty. We also had kal dosai which as the waiter explained was cooked not on a pan but in a kadai(a cooking vessel). It is softer and free of any stuffing.

Foodzie,"Rated Saravana Bhavan is the most popular chain of vegetarian restaurants in Chennai.I still have fond memories of eating in their first branch in KK Nagar.It was and it is still an excellent place to have lunch.So my expectations were quite high when I first visited this restaurant. Till now I have visited more than half a dozen times and my observations are -> 1.The connaught place branch is usually better than the one at Janpath, especially for lunch. 2.Dosas are not very good.From the plain dosa to the exotic Panchavarna Uttapam, I tried them all but I have never been delighted. 3.Appam is the best item.You should first try it with side dish and later can experiment with coconut milk.Idlies and other steamed stuff are also good. 4.Their ice creams and sundaes are good and provide good value for money, especially when compared with the prices of other items sold here.Luv Litchi is my personal favorite. 5.My major grouse is that the chutney and sambar served here are not up to Saravana Bhavan standards.Somebody must tell them that it is not enough if coconut chutney looks white and pudina chutney looks green but they should also taste well.The onion and tomato curry is relatively good. 6.Sambar is okish.But it is still better compared to other south indian restaurants in Delhi-NCR. The trick is they always serve it piping hot and the heat enhances the taste ;) 7.The meals is ok.The taste of its items fluctuates.You may try it once in a while for some items like 'Kootu, Kara Kuzhambu, Thuvaiyal' etc, but for regular eating, Andhra Bhavan is definitely better.Also the quantities provided here are quite small which makes you wonder if they want you to eat or to just taste the items! It lacks value for money. 7.Ambiance is okish.They play instrumental versions of tamil songs as background music. The problem is they don't choose the best melodies but play tunes of songs which you usually like to sing along.Now that's good if you are a tamilian and like those songs.But non tamilians won't like them as they are not the most soothing tunes. 8.It looks like 'Annachi'(proprietor of saravana bhavan) has directly imported the staff from Thoothukudi!(a place in South TN). Staying in an alien place and trying to learn a new language seems to have intimidated them.That's perhaps the reason for their ""shyness"" and average service.Speak to them in Tamil if you know the language.Else give them an emphatic smile and ask for the items sweetly/politely and you will definitely see a quickness in the service and they will also be happy! To sum up, I have deducted 1 point for the meals and chutneys and another half a point for the dosas! I would go back for the Appam and Luv Litchi, but for other snack items, I would prefer Sagar Ratna at Defense Colony!",Rated 3.5,28,26,??

RmST,"Rated Saravana Bhavan is a treat for any South Indian craving for a dosa or a thali meal. Located in CP, it's clean and always crowded. Sometimes, you might even have to wait outside for a while. However, it's definitely worth the wait. The dosas are simply delicious, and come with three different kinds of chutney and sambar. Though they cost double the amount for which it is usually available in the South, it's worth it because there are very few places in Delhi which serve authentic South Indian cuisine. The idlis dipped in sambar are also mouthwatering. So is the amazing thali. This restaurant is so good that even a passionate carnivore like me doesn't feel deprived of meat.

The factors affecting this judgement is not just the mouth watering delicasies they serve but also the friendly staff which is very helpful and cooperative, reasonable pricing which is very friendly to the pocket, ample seating space which makes the waiting time lesser and most importantly its location. I cant remember the number of times I have gorged on the Rava Kichdi/idlis/Rava Dosas (the list just goes on) after my shopping spree at Janpath which is right across the road.

You can try pretty much anything, and it will be better than every other place in Delhi, but I'd especially recommend the following: the masala/ onion rava masala dosas, the idiyappam, and the mini idlis. Yum yum. A couple of notes of caution: like the other Southie breakfast places, this place is not about opulence or atmosphere - it's only about the food. And the service, while decent, is not lightning-quick like Sagar Ratna, which completely spoilt Delhi-ites in terms of service times.

The interior is rather odd, the black table and chairs give a more fine dining or formal feel yet the huge wall mural and other parts feel like a lower end coffee shop. The bar and payment area has massive bright blinding lights right above your head which is very odd. Its not bad but I think they could have done so much better when fitting out this place. It has zero atmosphere. We ordered risotto balls to start which were quite nice but nothing special. Seafood paella which was dissapointing since the pieces of fish were virtually nonexistant, maybe 2 prawns,2 clams,2 calamri and whole swag of mussels which are a cheap way of filling a dish out. Also ordered a regular size pizza which apart from not being properly cooked ( the base was actually soggy) it was exteremly thin and to be honest I could have had a better pizza by selecting home brand pizza at countdown. The service was friendly and professional but overall the dining experience doesnt make me rush to come back",Rated 2.0,1,0,??
Abhishek,"Rated Delhi, for most people is all about Butter Chicken, Kebabs and Rumali Roti. A visit to purely vegetarian Saravana Bhawan located in Connaught Place quashes all such misconceptions that people might have about Delhi and Delhiites' taste buds. People lining up for their names to be called out on weekends bears testimony to the awesome South Indian affair this place is known for. All this, when you have at least one outlet each of all those famous fast food chains in the near vicinity. A simple looking menu lists for you a wide array of South Indian delicacies in a very organized manner which helps a great deal for those who are rather uninformed about the courses on offer. You can expect to be attended to as soon as you occupy a table by very efficient and friendly staffs that are willing to lend a helping hand to order the right food suiting your taste buds. I mostly start with steamed idly and medhu vada as both these are unbelievably light and melt-in-your-mouth kinds. Follow it up with appam (preferably with a side dish) which is made from a batter of soaked rice and coconut milk. It is very similar to a pancake, made from fermented rice flour. It tastes amazing with a spicy side dish setting the mood for the main course that follows. Being spoilt for choice isn't always a good thing and this place offers a never-ending range of dosa to choose from, which is both, tantalizing and confusing at the same time. I have a weakness for rawa dosa so more often than not, I end up ordering a dosa from category, favourites being rawa masala and coconut rawa. They also have a dry fruits rawa dosa which is on the sweeter side but somehow fails to impress barring the improvisation bit. Be it a dosa or uttapam that you order for main course, make sure you accompany it with butter milk. For rice lovers, there's no dearth of choices as there is different types of flavoured rice to choose from. They also have various options in Thali with numerous mini bowls filled with rasam, curd, vegetables, sambhar etc, each having its own distinctive flavour. If you wish to order one, do check for the timings they serve these Thalis as there is a different type of Thali for lunch, dinner and tiffin. To square up your meal, you may order a milk shake, my favourites being Sapota and mango. Coming to sweets, the badam halwa and rawa kesri is to die for and sweet pongal in case you are visiting there during lunch hours. On your way out, you may like to get a few sweets packed at the counter out of which saravana laddoo, coconut ball, mysore pak and muscoth halwa are definitely a few notches above the rest. 3.75/5",Rated 4.0,26,85,??

Subhashani Dewada,"Rated Nothing compares to the taste when you have eaten home cooked South Indian food in Kerala. But Sarvana Bhawan comes close. It definitely scores over Sagar Ratna which has lost it old glitter. I for one avoid stepping into Sagar Ratna. Just recently took my elderly parents out for lunch. Yes there is waiting but they are considerate enough to make sure that the elderly and physically challenged people do not have to climb to the first floor. The staff is friendly, smiling and courteous and they know their food. I like asking about the various ingredients that are being added or how my food is being prepared. The Fixed Thali is a good deal and can be shared between 2 people very easily and then can be topped off by a smaller dish like Idly or Vada or a sweet whatever you prefer. This time we tried the Kara Dosa and it had a very different taste which really appealed to us. The Dry Fruit Dosa is simply amazing. I asked for a non-ghee preparation of the Dosa and it was perfectly made, amply sprinkled with dry fruits, not sweet at all and I think that's waht I'll have next time I visit Sarvana Bhawan. I stay away from ghee as i personally do not like the taste. So I make sure to inform the person taking the order to not add ghee to my dishes. Badam Halwa, though heavy has an authentic taste. I was able to eat just half a spoon (yes ghee here was an exception). My Father cannot chew well so he went for the Lemon Rice with curd and that went down well with him. He did like his share of sweets and enjoyed the Kesari Bhat and Payasam. Though for me the Payasam was too sweet. Oops... How can I forget the Filter Coffee. Had one before meals, one with meals and one after meals. I love their filter coffee and don't mind drinking as much as I can. All in all we were four adults and ran a bill of Rs.1000/-.

Bala Kumar,"Rated The big plus is the variety of South Indian food they offer and the big minus is the difficulty with which we get a seat there - leave alone entering inside on peak hours. But the food is worth waiting. The amazing thing is that the consistency in delivering the same taste in all their outlets - may it be in India or abroad. They have to concentrate on putting up smiling faces to the customers including attending to the needs of ""allowing the customer to enjoy the food - taking a bit more time - rather than rushing through the food"" to allow them to sneak in more customers. Due to the popularity, I feel they should open more outlets so that the existing ones are not overcrowded and customers are not pushed to finish off the meal faster. My fav here is ""mini meals"" which has 4 different types of rice with a host of chutneys plus a sweet floating in ghee.",Rated 4.0,1,7,??

Purabi Dutta Chowdhury,"Rated Yesterday we went for lunch to Saravana Bhavan. Have been hearing about it for a long time now. When was in Chennai for a short trip, wanted to visit, but could not due to paucity of time. We had to wait for some time and it was quite hot. Maybe they should make a waiting area considering there is always a queue there. The ambiance was simple and service was ok-ish. But the food was really good. Dosas with all accompaniment were lovely. So were the Vadas. There are also a wide range of sweet dishes and snacks available at the counter.",Rated 4.0,78,542,??

This place beats its competitors like Sagar Ratna hands down, and I have been craving to go here again. Food: Their dosas are excellent. If you are not one to count calories, go for the Ghee Paper Roast Masala Dosai (they spell dosai as they pronounce it!). Their Idiyappams are the softest I have had in Delhi, and how I wish this place served non-vegetarian as well and I could my Idiyappams with Fish Curry/ Mutton Curry. Don't miss the filter coffee!

And apart from home-cooked South Indian food, Saravana Bhawan is the best that I have tasted. In an otherwise non veg-dominated life that I lead, their Porota Curry and Dahi Vada come across as the perfect flag bearers of the ""Green revolution"".

Sarvana Bhavan may not be as frequent a name on streets as Sagar Ratna but people who eat at this place definitely make more frequent visits than to Sagar Ratna. Their masala dosa is perched firmly back on top, and better than that at their rival across other areas. The sambhar here, too, is way better (and has always been) and spiced better.

TJ GULATI,"Rated I am not such a fan of South Indian food but my wife is, a really big fan, so I have to tag along, out of choice mostly. I am glad that I went to Saravana Bhavan, it was my first visit there, at Connaught Circus, CP, ND. It took us nearly half an hour to get in, as there was long waiting for that. But quality of food made up for that waiting period. It was the best Masala Dosa, I ever had. My son went for a Paneer dosa & he lapped it off quickly enough, otherwise he is a very fussy eater. My wife went for mixed veg Dosa, which had finely chopped veges & it tasted pretty different. She also ordered another Masala dosa & shakes were better than McD, a clear tribute to Saravana's quality. It was a total value for money dinner for us three. I wish to visit Saravana soon enough again, so that we can try more of their specialities. Kudos to Saravana. Gulatis Gurgaon",Rated 4.0,1,2,??

Prassenjit Lahiri,"Rated The best South-Indian food in Delhi. Whenever I'm around Connaught Place, I try to go here and have a Dosa. No one makes Dosas as good as them. Their 'Thalis' are good too, if you are in for a total experience of South-Indian cuisine. Apart from their Dosas, their 'Sweet Pongal' dessert is AMAZING. It's on the high-calorie side, but it's worth checking out. The prices are reasonable too. You don't end up overspending. You can have a big hearty meal, without digging a hole in your pocket. The only problem is it's always crowded, and you are going to have to wait for sometime to get a place to sit. But the food makes up for that, it's worth the wait. They also have some sweets and snacks, that you can take home, which are pretty good too.

Yummraj,"Rated In a nutshell: The best South Indian Vegetarian restaurant in Delhi Short Description - In case u r in a hurry: It's a pity that there is no Saravana Bhawan in Gurgaon & we have to drive 35 km to eat a lunch or dinner here. If u reach after 1.15 in the afternoon or 7.30 in th evening, u will b standing in a queue on the shaded footpath. They just opened up a second restaurant besides the earlier one recently. Food is excellent - Soft, fermented feel piping hot idly with some super cool accompaniments. Very nice & fresh medu vada, a huge list of tasty & interesting dosas, utthapams, adai, aviyal etc. In case adai sounds new, pls read the detailed description. The south Indian thali is very good & so r the South Indian dessert options. There r quite a few fresh fruit juices available & of course the filter coffee. Detailed Description - In case u have the time to enjoy reading: The idly is served soft, fermented feel, piping hot with the best green chutney in Delhi, a thick white tasty chutney, a dip of Gunpowder in ghee & a bit of a very interesting curried chutney. Murugan Idly of Chennai is better than this but this is the best in Delhi so far. Medu vada is fried fresh & served straight out of the kadhai - has a mild fermented flavor & a thin coating. The one at Murugan Idly Chennai had a better flavor & taste due to presence of whole black pepper & few other spices in the batter. The crust of the medu vada at Banana leaf Kolkata was better than the one at Saravana Bhawan. So once again there r others in other cities who do a better job but for Delhi this is the best & very good on its own if u do not compare to others. Dosas r very good - like quite a lot of them. Special like the spicy red filling Mysore rawa dosa & the Ghee dosa - fried with ghee. The potato filling served with dosa at Murugan Idly Chennai again beats the one at Saravana Bhawan hands down. The one at Saravana again is quite good on its own. Adai is kind of a dosa made with lentils. Very very tasty. The thali has rice, poori & a multitude of curries, dal, sambhar & rasam. A pickled & deep fried Red Chilli that is served with the food is unique & awesome. Ghee poli for desserts is superb - light sweet, thin 'sweet parantha'. So r a lot of other desserts. U can buy a wide range of sweets for takeaway at a sweet counter as well. The fruit juices r as fresh as they can get & r made in separate machines - So flavors of the fruit remain as virgin as possible. The 'straang' filter coffee is too good & I never have less than 2 at one go. Overall, it's the best in Delhi NCR - We travel 35km to eat here & if I am not mistaken, we wud have eaten at least 40 times in the last 7 years!!!!

Mrs. Kamla Chawla,"Rated I visited this South indian restaurant today for lunch, when suddenly I just felt a craving and wanted to have something having it's origins in down south. And honestly, I wasn't disappointed at all. Read on and i am sure most will agree just by reading my experiences of the place, just like my friend who accompanied me. LOCATION: The place is located on the Janpath lane, bang opposite to the various handicraft shops claiming to sell authentic Indian crafts. Now whether their claim is right or not, is something best left for their shoppers to decide, I can certainly say that Saravana bhavan indeed serves some of the most authentic South indian cuisine and even goes beyond while at it!! Any Parking problem: No, frankly because there is ample parking space right opposite the place and around as well. Also the place is in C.P. so easily accessible via metro too. Dining space: The place is well spread and divided in two floors..ground and first. We chose the upper one though, for no specific reason. Now the MAIN AGENDA i.e. food: We first went in for some very spicy n piping hot Rasam, duly served with large beer-like glasses and crunchy papads. For the main course, then we went in for Rava masala dosas which, atleast we both feel, were some of the best in town and going by our recent travel to South indian cities, I can genuinely vouch for it's authenticity and AWESOME taste. Then we went in for another round...and ordered Idlis this time.. and the really HUGE size of the idlis took us by surprise indeed, though a very pleasant surprise at that! And before i bid adieu to the main course, foodies as we both friends are, we also went in for a very very SCRUMPTIOUS DRY FRUIT dosa.. on sharing basis, though.. and what a delight it was.. it was a very colorful sort of dosa with red and green raisins, kaju, kishmish et al and had a different but very yummy sweet taste.... an awesome combination which frankly I never had before...not even on our trip to South Indian cities...Even their Dahi Vadas were very good and freshly prepared and I certainly recommend all to try them atleast once. Now for the desserts portion..where this place really REALLY EXCELS......... I frankly could not anticipate the wide variety of sweet delights available there and could not even ask for any more...Out of the plethora of options available, I went in for the BLACKFOREST MAGIC.. which is a very delightful combination of blackforest cake base topped with three scoops of choco-chip icecream and served with fresh cherries.. too good to even recall..... wow... My friend went in for the traditional Rawa kesari halwa and that too was very tasty and authentic. COST: Approx cost for 2 is very reasonable, at Rs. 600 including almost everything. So I would recommend this very fine South indian restaurant for its yummy food, very good ambience, rich feel and very reasonable prices as well...All in all a very very fun way to have a nice meal and nicer experience. SO ENJOY ALL FELLOW FOODIES COZ THIS PLACE IS A MUST VISIT. TRY IT AND YOU WILL REMEMBER READING THIS REVIEW. THANKS.",Rated 4.0,1,4,??

MANAV MEHTA,"Rated I used to be a regular till a few weeks back, but repeated poor service finally got my goat and I have not bothered to go back. First, you cannot choose a seat but will be made to sit according to the whims of the steward. Then, there's a rule of thumb followed by attendants - customers are overbearing idiots, so only listen to them when you feel like. The effort it takes to get a refill of Sambar or water corroborates this. Worst of all, you are not allowed to pause during a meal because the stewards are usually timing you on speed, and jump in unsolicited to ask what else is to be ordered. You cannot sit awhile and talk, and as soon as you finish, the bill shall come flying to you (again unsolicited) and then they begin cleaning off the tables leaning across even as you sit, clearly indicating that you are no longer welcome. The food was never in question (it's great), but the prices they charge are not worth the overall experience.",Rated 1.0,4,11,??
Sapna,"Rated It is an authentic South Indian restaurant but most of the delicacies are not available for dinner (Lemon rice, tomato rice etc). Certain variety of dishes are available only on certain days. I don't understand why any restaurant should do this?! The Dosas were good but the Dahi Wada was quite ordinary. The food although good is quite expensive and not really worth the price. They are very popular for lunch with the office crowd so may be are not paying much attention to the people who wish to enjoy a south Indian dinner!",Rated 3.0,6,18,??
