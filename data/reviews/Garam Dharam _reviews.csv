Kashish Bajaj,"Rated Over-Hyped Place! I went with my family as i heard its a restaurant with a desi pinch based on bollywood theme- dharmendra thats why its named Garam Dharam. Retro music, retro ambience was according to their theme but too much of the golden lights were not eye catching. Service was satisfactory. Food was not upto expectations. The quantity served was not enough and the taste dint tempt my taste buds. I tried their classic cocktail - shera (orange juice with vodka), nothing new! Their dahi ke kebab and daal makhani were average, paneer lababdar sucked big time. There is a lot of scope for improvement in the taste of food.",Rated 2.5,12,6,??
Foodie Singh (Pujneet),"Rated I went to this restro without any great expectations. I have seen 2.9 ranking on zomato and knows that my experience going to be average or below. - Went on Saturday night, got table for 2 in 10-15 minutes waiting time at around 9:30pm. - Restro is very beautiful, full of colors and energetic. - Restro was full with Dada dadi papa mummy and chunnu munnu means all age people was there. - Music was very very loud. Full of Bollywood tadka. Music was that much loud even service boys can't take food orders properly. Don't understand purpose of playing so loud music in family type restro. - Service was not up to the mark. I have found service boys not well trained. They were doing their best but something was missing. - My purpose of visiting different different restaurants to experience new things and food. - I love trying new things and that is the reason I have tried 3 different cocktail drinks - Basanti, Paan and Pyare which comes with 60ml of alcohol of yours choice. I liked all cocktails and these cocktails are the only reason I will go to this restro again. - With drinks I ordered Dahi ke kebab which was perfectly cooked. - MASALA PAPAD WAS THE WORST THING I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE IN ANY RESTRO. Papad was full of red chillies, taste less and waste of money. How can someone can put so much of red chillies on masala papad which no one can eat. I eat lots of spicy food but this papad was something to throw in dustbin. - I have noticed the quantity of main course is good and that was the reason I placed order for just Gobhi masala. - Gobhi masala was cooked very well and along with Gobhi I have ajwain and kasturi methi paranthas. I didn't tried their non veg food but for sure will have in next visit. Things that needs improvement are service & loud music. Food is just above average nothing great. They are opening a second branch in rajouri garden and hope they will come up with better plan in that location. Thanks,",Rated 3.0,89,272,??

Smarth Kharbanda,"Rated Horrible experience at Garam Dharam. The management is irresponsible and clearly doesnt know how to run a restaurant. You cannot get customers with just making good interiors, one has to serve their customers equally. THE MANAGER (ABHISHEK) SEEMS ILLITERATE AND IS CERTAINLY NOT FROM THE INDUSTRY. Doesnt know even how to talk to their clients. Maybe the customers have given them too many visits than they deserve, clearly their minds are above in the clouds.I got humiliated on the night of 3rd feb when I went there with a family of 25 people for a party. WORST DECISION EVER!!! I literally served my guests myself and running here and there for catch holding the waiters. 3 of my guest and myself did not have our food as we were busy serving our guest. On this the Manager told me please come next time and they shall serve better!!! not even an apology!!!Great going guys!!! A STRONG ADVICE PLEASE DO NOT RUN ANY RESTAURANT JUST MAKE THEM AND SELL IT TO SOME ONE WHO COULD BECAUSE YOU PEOPLE DEFINITELY NOT CAPABLE OF RUNNING ONE!!!!",Rated 1.0,2,28,??
Epicurean,"Rated Desi at its best. Truly justifies theka te dhaba concept. New one in cp but overcrowded even on a Monday night. Loved the idea of serving cocktails and mocktails in glass bottles that resemble ""pauaa"". Music might make you secretly tap your feet. Good stuff!",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Rishi Bhasin,"Rated Only saving grace is dharmender's songs, food nothing exceptional Stewards had such high attitude like they were doing favor to us, a dirty glass given to them was wiped and given to me ,no new glass no apology, dinner plates were given without spoon and fork , manager will not have time to go to any table and ask for feedback. Blistering hot where people were eating food whilst sweating With current average rating of 2 garam Dharam and attitude of staff,restaurant is not going to survive for long and bubble of customers are going to disperse to other better restaurants. Sincere request to get ABC of hospitality right",Rated 1.0,92,71,??

Grownfear,"Rated ""Garam Dharam"" a place which is solely based on a theme . Theme for a bollywood actor , ""dharmendra"". Hence , named garam dharam. The glossy sign board with the bulbs around snd flashing small led's. It starts with an a glass door entry with a heavy wood outings. The menu outside is placed on a old retro camera roll . As u go inside it gives u a glimpse of old superhits. So we went on a valentine evening , a fully jam packed nd we waited for about 5 mins (just because the owner is dad's freind). We were 4 people and were seated upstairs . The decor is nice , like the old dhabha look , and the walls painted sholey on it .the lamp shades are made from buckets and tea pots . This was the most exciting thing of all. Now we decided to order kadhai chicken and soya chhaap followed by a dal makhani . My fancy world did come to an end when i could see only 4 pieces of chicken out in a small kadai with loadszz of capsicum nd onions. The dal's quantity was not even spoon full for 2 people . This all could be seen on our table after an approximate time of 40 minutes. We could have said it a gala time but to my surprise it was just not the dharamrendra style or punjabi . Bieng a punjabi , taste and spices matters alot , but here in both were missing. The chicken seems to be boiled and then used . The curry was more of a chinese thing than to be added a flavoured touch for punjabi's . Daal definately needs a hand on and u could eat it better from a dhaba than from here. Soya chaap was the only thing for us which made us feel better and helped us enjoying our supper. Over all - a little over hyped place . In the rat race of the food chain it needs a definately touch up nd the staff needs to be more polished . Tip for the place- make sure if u are expecting it to be a place with a average ambience , seat urself down not below the speakers upstairs where in the base needs to controlled because of the extra treble that makes eardrums pain . Over all a 3 . Cheers..!!!",Rated 3.0,55,213,??
Akhilesh Ahirwal,"Rated The ambience was good. The hospitality and service were pathetic. The food was not worth for money. The waiters had casual attitude and delayed the order and the food served was not delicious. Music is too loud to sit and talk. Customers need to ask for basic things like chutney, bowls, water etc. No suggestion book for the customers. The restaurant is a hype on the name of bollywood star. Its better to go to a dhaba and enjoy food. ""Mere wastage of money"". Not at all recommended.",Rated 1.0,1,0,??

Rajat Vashishta,"Rated Awful place. Accidentally planned for a dinner here because of some rave word of mouth reviews - it seemed like everyone was dining at Garam Dharam! Ended up with a pathetic experience. Food: bad taste. Nobody liked it. We had paneer, chicken, dal, some starters and mocktails. 80% stuff ended up with a poor aftertaste. Except dal makhani which was good. 2/5 Ambiance: awful, overcrowded. There was a rat in the private area where we sat. There were 2 families there. After we informed the waiter they came back with HIT and sprayed it!! The main area of the restaurant was overcrowded. Music was dumb. It was like a kid on a console randomly tapping on any button and changing the song anytime. A 60s song followed by honey singh followed by Coke studio! 1/5 Service: was quick. 3/5 They are ruining Dharamender's name.",Rated 2.0,64,140,??

Anchit Jain,"Rated Visited this place for an early dinner and got a table of our choice without much efforts. The ambience of the place is quite nice which reminded me of bar scene shot in Dharmedra's movie ""Yamla Pagla Deewana"". We ordered a Kadhai Paneer and some butter naans. Naans were fine but the Kadhai paneer was a total disaster. It was high on spices and low on taste. Now coming to worst part - the service. The managers of this place are quite high headed and doesn't really care much for the customer. They are least bothered whether the customers are enjoying themselves or not. Though the servers were still good and even bought our food on time. This place doesn't tick even a single column whether it be ambience, food or service. This place can surely be given a miss with a lot better options available in CP!",Rated 1.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Special lights on top made out of old kettles n buckets !! Coming to service that's the weakest point... The servers are unaware of details if asked about dishes n speciality... We ordered drinks like lemon ice tea n watermelon lassi which were OK... starters veg seek kabab n tandoori chat.. 2 portions each they served 1 portion n said "" dusre Mein time lagega"" Taste of seek kabab was good but tandoori chat came as surprise to be tandoori pineapple which was too spicy that can be relished only if u can handle that much!! Coming to food or main course we ordered dal makhani paneer lababdar, tava chap , veg biryanis, Amritsari naan which where served with pundits choley.... In breads we tried tandoori roti, butter naan, also!! Dal tasted good but was not hot enough n biryanis had no taste to relish... Rest all was ok!!

Eat Style Shop,"Rated When you know that the restaurant is Bollywood superstar Dhramendra's our expectations rise. But does the place stand-up to all our expectations? Frankly, it doesn't. I have been to the restaurant twice now and my experience both the times has been different. The first time, I went for lunch with two of my besties and the food was great. Bollywood music was wafting in the background while the hospitality and food was amazing. However, the next time I went for dinner and the experience was bad. The place played Bollywood songs in full volume like we were in a club. After insisting a couple of times they just reduce the volume for a few minutes. The service was poor and food was mediocre. I guess for me there will be no third time here What we ate: We had Paneer Tikka, Murg Malai and Dahi K Kabab for starters Dal Makhani, Dal Tadka, Amritsari Choole (excellent), Butter Chicken and Paneer Lababdar(good). What we drank: One major issue here is that they don't give 30ml drinks. The minimum is 180ml. So if you are alone and want to drink, they will want you to get sloshed. How much we paid: The first time the bill was close to 1700 and around 4k the second time.",Rated 2.5,20,5,??

Anyway coming to the point... The food was tasty very tasty and we were having a really good time until a waiter misbehaved.. Waiters were so busy gossiping and so busy making fun that they forgot they were in a professional space and any mistake on their side could lead to the downfall of the restaurant's reputation and it did..,Rated 3.0,7,31,??

The interiors of this place are definetely impressive , the use of objects that old antique bike from sholay and posters of Dharmendar Ji movies are all good But when it came to food it was a big disappointment We ordered Kadhai Chicken , Dal Makhni and Paneer . I must elaborate that kadhai chicken is supposed to be spicy but in this case it was not at all , it lacked all that spicy flavour and paneer lababdar was sweet ( we specially requested them to make it spicy). Paneer was taken back and when served again it had big green chillies in it (i think thats the only way they know to make it spicy). Our order was taken back twice but still it lacked the real indian flavour. No idea whether it was just once or they do this with every order. I would not suggest this to anybody.",Rated 2.0,1,7,??
Sunakshi Koul,"Rated Well, as the name says ""Garam Daram"" the theme is based on the macho mann himself Darmendar. The cafe is setup in a way that you actually feel like taking a ride back in the time of Jai-Veeru!! The fun fact is they also have the scooter on display which was used in sholay movie by jai-veeru. With the mid-90's background tracks(Ofcourse all of darmendar) and all the pictures you actually feel the time passing by! A family restaurant! Must visit!! Although the food was good but *Special garam daram soya chap* was awful..they deep fried the Chap which made it look good but as soon as you taste it you are taken back I ordered chicken kalli mirch and spcl soya chap in starters. Kali mirch was fab but soya chap yukkk! Mocktails- Peach ice tea(Must taste) they also have basil one(can have that too! Must have *pyar di gutti* and flavored lassi!!",Rated 3.0,7,96,??

Shrey Mittal,"Rated Crossing the outer circle in CP, just near the M Block you see a long queue of people waiting, ""what is that?"" will be the question that will pop in your head unless you go and see it for yourself! Garam Dharam is a relatively new place for the enthusiastic Delhi diners and I had the opportunity to visit and experience the true flavours of Punjab! The dcor is chic and the moment you enter you'll be welcomed with a vibe of the desi theka, just like the one in Yamla Pagla Deewana(a Dharmender movie of course!) bullet or bult as its referred to and the furniture which just sums up the entire place. The colours of possibly every shade with a rustic touch of the elements like the Truck horns, the tumbi, not to forget the bar which is exactly the same as a theka which you'll find in Punjab. Beginning with the food (vegetarian) we ordered Paneer Lababdar and Mix Veg Korma along with Amritsari Kulcha which is served with Raita and Choley and all this with a basket of assorted breads. The flavour of the food will bring a smile to your face not because it's delicious but there's a party of flavours in your mouth! Perfectly seasoned and served hot food along with the essentials and Nimbu Masala Banta. We finished our meal with the Kheer and the Phirni. The Phirni is unlike any Phirni you'll have in the neighbouring areas of Delhi and since this place is heavily inspired by the theme of Punjab and the vibe of the superstar Mr Dharmender himself, it packs the punch of flavours! Service was impeccable! Considering it was a Sunday night and we were dining at 9:30 the quality of service and the attention of the server were top notch. On top of that, the pricing which is just perfect even when compared to the competitors offering similar cuisine in CP or South Delhi for that matter. It's a place that one MUST VISIT if you're a lover of North Indian food because there's so much to offer. Either you're going for celebratory meals or maybe just a nice time with friends and family. If you're new to this cuisine then there's no better place in CP to go to other than Garam Dharam.",Rated 5.0,3,59,??
Ashish Arora,"Rated I fail to understand the reason for the hype surrounding this place. This is no more than a punjabi restaurant serving alcohol. The place is true to its name. a dhaba with theka. It is decked up based on Dharam Ji and plays Indian Bolllywood of his times and punjabbi numbers as well. Food - Decent 3/5 Alcohol - Expensive compared to other places in CP. Service - Non existent In Connaught place of today where there are more bars than you can count, this is one of those places where you can go with Kids and Family for Dinner and Drinks probably that explains the queue outside this place., but this place will have to do a lot more to even beat Pind Baluchi, forget getting better.",Rated 3.0,11,1,??
Barkha Handa,"Rated In spite of the fact that this restaurant has just recently been opened here at CP, they have managed to keep the standards well! There is an interesting entry here and the place was mostly filled up but we got a seat eventually.

After entering the Restaurant the main attraction will be the amazing huge portraits of Bollywood Super star Dharmendra Paji, Old Bullet and the different Desi colours used in lighting and furniture. The main purpose for restaurants are serving delicious food. We ordered Chole-Kulche and Paneer tikka for starter. Paneer tikka was mouth watering and Kulche was nicely cooked but chole was not so good in taste. In main course we ordered Kadhai Paneer, Rumali Roti, Bondi Raita, Yellow Dal and Egg Curry. Starting from egg curry which was delicious, Kadhai Paneer is must eat, Yellow Dal was delicious,Raita was very disappointing. Over all everything was perfect from Ambience to Food.

Kamakshi Gupta,"Rated So we visited garam dharam after hearing a lot about! It did not match the expectations we had from overhyped place. Interiors are good enough but too much in such a small place which makes it more crowded. We have to wait for 50 min to enter the place which was may be because of crowded weekends. But once we ordered food it was such a put off. Service is too slow and we have to ask them after 15 minutes to serve water atleast. We ordered from very limited options from menu. We ordered dahi ke kebab, paneer tikka, dal makhani paneer lababdar amritsari kulcha and garlic naan. Out of which dal was better than the rest! Everything seemed to be served without salt.

Beautiful creativity and it actually felt as if walking into someone's personal treasure and walking down ""dharm pajis"" memory lane.

Winnie Malik,"Rated Before I begin with the review, I have to mention that this is strictly a vegetarian dish review. The ambience of the place resonates with the 1960's bar (lilly bai ka theka). The bar is covered in jail like cage with small openings to serve drinks. The order: -Drinks: Mango lassi, sweet lassi, salty lassi, lime and lemon. -Food: Dal makhni, mix veg, methi malai mutter, laccha parantha, tandoori roti. The usp of the place lies in how the food and beverages are served and not in the food. For the amount you spend on food here can easily take you to far better places. Pricewise, not wise at all with the quality and taste that they offer. Overall though its a place that one can give a miss; if you do decide to go, be prepared for a wait time of 20 -25 mins.",Rated 3.0,15,40,??

The service was very slow after serving us the drinks. It took a lot of time to come. The food was really very good. But, weren't satisfied by the service.",Rated 3.5,8,2,??
Fresh Lime Soda,"Rated So, you get enticed by the name. And so, you decide to check-out the place and its menu. Maybe just to see, how much semblance the legend has on the menu of the place. It was more or less the same with me too. On a balmy evening, I stepped into Garam Dharam and was quite awed by the ambience. Yes, the ambience is something that will appeal to your senses, the moment you step in. Well-lit, dotted with knick-knacks to complete the dhaba feel and overall, a big compliment to the superstar, Dharmendra. Going by what I heard in my circle, I wanted to begin with the famed signature mocktails. Amusing names and even more amusing tastes. Veeru ki Ghutti, has a nice sandalwood flavour. Refreshing, different and above all, a class apart from the myriad mocktails, I had at various other watering holes. Parimals Paan Gulabo as the name suggests is a paan flavoured mocktail, recommended only for those with a taste for the desi-post meal-must have. Pyaare Mohan, though has a lovable name but failed to impress me much, as it was way too spicy for my taste buds. But the one that took the cake is the watermelon Lassi. Keeping all the elements of a classic lassi intact, it has a soothing undertone of watermelon flavour. Delightful! Now, lets come to the starters. Kakori Kebabs, a starter that tops my list of desi appetisers, didnt live up the expectation. Found it a bit average. Next, in my order of preference was Dhaba Murg Tikka. With a hint of charcoal flavour, in its every bite, it was a marked deviation from the usual. But the Fish Tikka is something I will give a miss, during my next visit. Maybe, they should drop it from the menu. So, turn for the main course. Yes, I had space left for the main course. Envy me? Balti Meat, by now, is synonymous to Garam Dharam. This signature dish boasts of tender chunks of lamb in mildly spiced gravy. But theres nothing extraordinary about the dish. There are lot more eateries serving better versions of mutton, at a lesser price. The butter chicken, wasnt something that I would remember for a long time but then at the same time, cant labelled as never-to-be-ordered. Chicken lovers can definitely try it. Surprisingly, the show stealer was a vegetarian dish. Sarso ka Saag. With a myriad ingredients, this version surely finds a place amongst the best versions of the dish I had till date. Dont miss it! Overall, Garam Dharam is trip down the memory lane for hardcore Dharmendra fans. And while discussions at every second table reminisce the good old days and movies of the superstar, chances are you will find your favourite dish and topic too. So, basically, Garam Dharam is all about the ambience, a couple of mocktails and not much about its food and service. sweetfreshlimesoda.blogspot.com",Rated 3.0,42,446,??

Srj,"Rated Garam Dharam is the Garam hot place in CP these days thanks to the association with, and ode to the legendary superstar Dharmemdra ji, also because of its unique Dhaba and theka(bar) setting, and lastly for the very reasonable prices. My overall rating is a 3.25/5. This place too was on my must visit list for quite sometime and last night turned out to be an impromptu visit here. The place was packed, and had a waiting of more than an hour but that did not dampen our spirits, and we got our name on the list. The Sardarji at the waiting desk outside was helpful and courteous. Luckily we got a table within 30 minutes. Ambience: The place is huge, and gives a nice happy modern dhaba feeling. It beems with energy with lights and colourful theme all around, quirky filmy quotes, pictures etc. The legendary bike from Sholay also gets recreated here. Seating is good. The bar is nicely done up too. Don't miss the tree outside which gives a very desi feeling. I can safely say that this place is the most clicked restaurant in the city right now thanks to the concept. Menu/food & Service: The cuisine served is Punjabi/North Indian, and lots of options are available. We ordered a Dal makhni, paneer lebabdar, dahi kebab, boondi raita, and breads. Dahi kebab was brought in no time, and it had a crunchy taste on the outside and a melt in mouth curd filling inside but it tasted average as the curd was little too sour. The main course took a lot of time. Dal makhni was quite nice in taste but was served lukewarm. Paneer lebabdar was completely unlike what I have had at most other places. It was cottage cheese cubes dipped in a tangy tomato gravy which almost tasted like it was made using just tomato puree. So, just decent at best again. Raita and breads were nice. Our server was good with suggestions and was cheerful. Service was nice. Meal cost just 1400 which I believe is their main USP. Garam Dharam can be visited once for sure. Don't expect lip smackin food and if you go with the Dhaba expectations(but at a restaurant which is hygienic) then you wont be disappointed. The ambience and the music will keep your spirits up, and the theka will provide you with other spirits if thats what you are after... P.s: Don't miss the Tree",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

And music is also too too Loud that my ears started paining.. Now comes the food what the decor and crockery you are using just like dhaba style but atleast the food you are serving should not be Road side food I mean the quality was not up to the mark of a C. P resturant and after all this you are charging price for a 7 dining resturant.... Also its a request to tell your waiters that to be a bit polite with your customers and especially children's you are in a service industry guys and you are charging for it and when we are ready for our dinner your waiter should themselves change the plates instead we requested them to change which they provided for snacks In the end highly hyped and not recommended Ranu Gupta Aggarwal,Rated 1.0,3,5,??

However, it was dissappointing right from the start. The music, when we entered, was dull and sad. We asked the waiter and he obliged to change it though. Next, we ordered butter chicken and soya chaap masala with breads. Both items were served within time, but were very cold, not heated up upto the mark. It's a good enough turnoff, especially when you have put a part of the dish into your plate. And when we reported that, the manager was pompous enough to say 'toh kya ho gaya, garam karde na'. The treatment was not expected. Moreover, the food is certainly NOT value for money. When you a good value for the food, you expect a good service in return atleast with a good ambience.

Sawan Chalise,"Rated Garam Dharam - Dharam Dharam Yes Garam Dharam is an ode to a Superstar, an Actor, a Legend in the history of Bollywood. Yes Garam Dharam is a Bollywood themed restaurant, catering to the need of such theme which is lacking in spite of our entire country being Bollywood crazy. Yes Garam Dharam is warm, welcoming, serves delicious food and has a twisted ambience. But is Garam Dharam perfect in every way? Nahh!!!! Garam Dharam is an experience in itself with superb ambience loaded with posters of the Superstar. The walls are filled with movie names that Dharmendraji had started in. Garam Dharam has a tiny lorry that serves as the DJ's den. It has a buggy attached bike, reminding us of the Sholay days. The walls and tables do not give you a high-end restro feel. You literally agree that you are in a Dhaba that has been designed by some experienced interior designer who has an eye for everything Filmy. Even the washroom is not ordinary. The music that fills the ambience is one addition that makes Garam Dharam the hot spot that it is. Thank you DJ in the lorry. We had ordered for Dahi Chicken, Kurkure Bhindi, Kadai Paneer and Lachcha Parantha. We literally had no complaints about the food and every item tasted delicious and was worthy of the praises that everyone in the table was busy singing. Kurkure Bhindi was crispy and tasted fantastic. Dahi Chicken was something that I never had before and the debut happened in a great manner. Kadai Paneer was somewhat usual. For the five of us, the fulfilling meal plus a beer pint cost around 2100. Fine I would say. But where this fun filled restaurant lacked is its service. Yes, they respected our cry and agreed to shift our tables. But the order took a good half an hour to arrive. I am not really complaining as the time was well utilized. Another factor, the staff seemed to be in a hurry for us to finish our food and that is why not even a second after we swallowed the last morsel, our table was empty. The place is heavily crowded and jampacked at the weekend. So once again I would refrain from blaming the staff for the hurry. Food - 4.5/5 Ambience - 4.5/5 Service - 4/5 Value for money - 3.5/5 Overall - 4/5 ( or you can say somewhere in between 4 and 4.5) Note : Garam Dharam is every foodies delight and a pleasing experience for those seeking a unique experience. My only fear is how will they cope up with the increasing crowd. If privacy and quiet meal experience is what you seek, you better stay out. After all it is Dharam Paji's restaurant.

Nitika Bhatia,"Rated Visited this Punjabi themed restaurant twice in a week, once for dinner and other time for Lunch. And after both the experiences, I must say I was left totally impressed. Big poster of Dharamendra, a colorfull skooter, the famous Sholay bike and many other aspects of Dharam's movies and life reflect in this place, giving you a feel of pure Desi dhaba. In food we had ordered Matar malai methi, Daal Makhani, shahi paneer, naan and Gulabo Chuski for dinner which was sufficient for us 4 people. The food was delicious with the original taste and rich flavor of Punjabi food and the portions were decent. For my lunch outing as we were just 2 people, we ordered their Dahi kebabs, veg thali and Paan gulabo mocktail. Paan gulabo didn't impress me much but the food compensated for that. Only few restaurants in Delhi make delicious Dahi kebabs, and I would say Garam Dharam is one of them as they got the flavor and texture just right. Veg thali was really sumptuous with portions good enough for 2 people with a light appetite. If you want to taste the best dishes the restaurant has to offer, you must order their Veg thali which had Daal makhani, paneer tikka, kadhi, shahi paneer, chole, Mix veg, raita, phirni, rice and naans.

Though there were larger groups who were maid to wait for 10-15 min. +Ambiance+ Oooo.. The ambience is very hot.. Most of the decor is just like a typical Punjabi road side Dhaba. Small posters and wall hanging of Dharmender. Loud Punjabi music. And the best part was the bar. They have set up there bar in a pure highway side thekka(liquor shop) Huge sitting area. And Punjabi style cutlery, copper glass, big plate etc. +Food+ From the design and decor and the way of service we had huge expectations, but unfortunately the food over here is a pure waste none of the dish met our expectation. Means we were eating over breads with the mint chutney provided as sides. (#) Dal makhni: it was dal and no one can call this as dal makhni, nothing as such creamy, not that much use if butter or any garnish. (#)Kadhai Chicken: well it was much of onions and less on chicken there were medium to small size chicken pieces more over there was no leg piece in that, only a piece of wings. And as a Kadhai chicken expectations were of spicy chicken gravy, but rather the gravy was complete tangy, full of tomato paste. (#)Paneer Lababdar: and again, a dish in tangy flavour, the size of each paneer piece was good, but again something that I would plz don't order. (#) the breads were normal just like at any other place though the size of breads were very good. +Final Verdict+ A place that is easily avoidable, very high price and very low on quantity and poor in quality.

And everything in this place is a new experience as for cp.... As far as food is concerned.... I loved the food there.... Dahi ke kabab were delicious.... Very delicate and simple in taste...which I thought added to the class of it.... however it depends as some may prefer it more spicy.....dal, shahi paneer were up to the mark and hot served breads are always tempting.....

Pradeep Chamaria,"Rated Well, my visit to Garam Dharam - Dhaaba te Theka kept on delaying since its inception in Sept 2015. Hence it was a special occasion when I finally visited the dhabba last week. The dhaaba was full when we walked into it about 15 minutes before our booking time. It was almost 4:00 in the late afternoon but we found people still waiting outside for their turn. We still were offered a temporary table and a few flavoured lassi to cool us down. We tried Mango and the Water Melon lassi. Both were equally good. Perfectly thick and sweet. A lot has been said about the quality and goodness of food and drinks served here. But honestly speaking our views are slightly different. Garam Dharam has had mixed opinions about its food, but the interiors have been liked by everybody. The semi-dim lighting and the interesting interiors made me like the decor instantly. It was a typical desi feel"" that I was looking for. The decor was that of a typical roadside dhaaba on national highways and the walls had Dharam Paaji all over them. The dhaaba started by Micky Mehta and Umang Tiwari surely is going to be the talk of the town soon. The entrance, made up as a bio-scope in the podium form is decorated with posters of Dharam paajis films and it gives an idea of whats going to come next as one enters the dhaaba. Divided into two floors, it has a combined area of over 4000 sq ft. Spread out like an open area on a paddy field along a highway the environs are truly made up like a dhaaba. The DJ Console in form of a highway truck installation, desi (country) liquor bar, quirky dialogues from Dharam paajis films on the back of the waiters, bucket lamps, antique spool tape recorder, rugged wood interiors, village styled brick walls add up to the mesmerizing atmosphere. . The cental point of attraction was the Bullet motorcycle with a side car from the legendary movie Sholay which saw Dharam paaji and Amitabh Bacchan sing the meomorable Yeh Dosti hum nahi todenge. Lots of people were seen posing and clicking with the bike to make their visit memorable. The restaurant also has hit dialogues like Basanti"" and others painted on the walls as well as on the staff outfits. The typical dhaaba style cutlery, glasses and big steel plates made me very happy. But dont worry they also have the more modernised forks, knifes and spoons to help the more clean variety of people. The food and drinks menu consist of dhaba style food with a bit of twist. The menu itself is very simple and fun to go through. It has everything that a simple man would like to eat at a dhaaba. Tikkas, kebabas, makhani daal, and a lot of non-vegetarian options along with desi styled drinks. The desi theka styled quirky bottles (desi pavvas) to serve mocktails were the highlight of our entire meal time and my favorite was Paan Gulabo; a paan and gulkand flavoured drink. Pyaare mohan, Verru ki Ghutti, Chulbula Jugnu, and Kalakhatta flavoured Chuski were some other flavours that we tried. Next we ordered some starters from the Dharam ji Special page from the Menu. We ordered for Soya chaap, Tandoori Paneer Tikka, Dahi ke Kebaba, and Annanans (Pineapple) ki Chaat. First of all it was the evergreen Tandoori Paneer Tikka. The paneer was soft, was perfectly marinated and tasted awesome. Then came the Garam Dharam Special Soya Chaap, I liked it. It was a regular chaap with a twist. It was batter fried with alu masala stuffing in it and tasted great. I loved the Annanas ki chaat wich followed and asked for a repeat serving. The Dahi ke kebabs were a real disappointment though. The flavours were missing. I guess they need to work very hard to improve on it by adding more spices and modifications. I had nothing for my lunch during the day time and I was hungry and wanted the dishes to come quickly on our table, but the service was very very slow. This is one thing that the management has to work on a lot. We waited for the main course. I had ordered for some authentic Punjabi food, Martaban Dal Makhni, Aloo Gobhi and Tawa Masala Kumbh (Mushrooms). The mushrooms were perfectly done and tasted awesome. I finished up my Kasturi Methi Lachha Paranthas with Mushrooms only, as the Makhani Daal was just okayish, and I left the Gobhi sabji after just one bite. I really liked the authentic looks of the servings and only wish that the management pasy some attention in improving the tastes of its dishes also so that it gives a full traditional feel. Also it is worth mentioning here that the food here had less oil and for this the management should be applauded. Less oily means low calories and this shoul go very well with todays diet consoiuc clients. Now it was time for my favourite dishes the desserts. We had Dharam Veer kesar kheer, Gajar ka Halwa and Gulab Jamun. Well again lot of work needs to be done to improve the quality and taste of the sweets Guys (Micky n Umang) thats the most important part of a meal and if you mess it up then obviously one has to leave with a sour and spicy taste in his mouth. Please take care of this and your Dhaaaba will and will certainly pull me back..",Rated 4.0,19,38,??
Piyush Verma,"Rated A highway styled dhaba for family dine-in and getogethers. So when I first saw this outlet, I was pretty amazed with a semi circular huge entrance on which it was beautifully written ""Garam Dharam"" and the attendant was standing besides an old-school picture screening machine. How to reach ? Deboard the train from rajiv chowk from gate no.4 and its a 10 minutes walk which was just parallel to metro gate at outer circle. It has a huge seating on ground floor and a small 1st floor which was not operational. The whole outlet was dedicated to Dharmendra. It had a simple yet different interiors with chairs, tables, steel round plates, bulb hangings under a metallic parat or a big plate used in homes to drain water from wet fruits and vegetables. All the walls were covering up with old memories of him with Amitabh or his Dream girl and a bullet with side seater and an old scooter dummy that reflects the trademark of his Bollywood career. Service was not an issue and we were not having any major issues regarding the same. Drinks Veeru di ghutti - It was served in a 180ml small glass bottle that would appear as a domestic whiskey bottle or a ""tharra"". It was a combination of sandlewood, cardamom, kaffir lime and gin as the base. Mango lassi - It was a very sweet mango flavoured lassi served in a huge glass that punjabis are famous for to consume. Saffron and peach lassi - It was a great combination of saffron and peach in a lassi and saffron was overpowering the flavour yet it was a great drink to have. Food Paneer tikka - It was slightly disappointing as it was undercooked and we could feel the marinated spices in our mouth that should not be taken place in the ideal situation. Kali mirch chicken - It was served in a rectangular pan and was very much satisfying and was cooked and spiced nicely. Although the pepper was on a higher side, still it was not making any kind of obstructions to the flavour of freshly cooked chicken . Fried soya chaap - The soya chaap was looking very attractive looking which was fried and filled with potato mash. It was fried in musturd oil which was not heated properly and was dominating in chaap. Balti mutton korma - Served in a little bucket with 4-5 pieces of mutton and a spicy gravy, it complimented amazingly with cheese garlic naan. It was the best dish I had on the table as a main course. Dal makhni - The most common and traditional dish for any north Indian, this must be cooked amazingly to make the day end with a smile. Garam dharam was successful for cooking up creamy textured dal served in a cylindrical metal container. Desserts Phirni - It was the dish of the day. Served in a bowl made out of sand and silver coating above it, it was very much creamy with almonds topped over it. Overall vegetarian snacks needs improvement but yet it provides a unique theme from high class outlets in Cannaught place.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Sinchita Kar,"Rated Is it unique? Is it innovative? Definitely! No restaurant in CP, so far, had the theme based on a movie superstar. They are the pioneer in terms of concept. They dedicated the whole restaurant to Dharmendra with his pictures framed all over, the Sholay style bike (yes! The one where Amitabh Bachchan sat by his side), and fusing it with the dhaba-like atmosphere. You can just pinpoint the dhaba ambience right from the entrance. The typical light colours splashed with a antique style bar. At the backyard, they have a huge tree and totally aced in setting up the ambience. After all this, I had great expectations in terms of food and drinks. When I scrolled through the menu, lassi caught my eyes and I usually heard that dhabas serve amazing lassi. Wanted to see if Dharam Gharam can keep up to expectations and they gladly did!! I ordered mango lassi and it came in a huge glass. Cold, flavourful, creamy and perfectly sweet! What more can I say? Along with drinks, some more appetisers came. The PANEER TIKKA just let me down. Undercooked with uncooked spices clearly ruining your taste buds. The DAHI KE KABAB could have been more flavourful according to me. However the curd was fresh! The KALI MIRRCH CHICKEN was the best appetiser of the evening. Mouth melting with the black pepper not overwhelming. However, unfortunately maybe, I couldn't appreciate the taste of ANDRA CHICKEN even though it's an amazing original dish! After being half full, main course seemed daunting but their amazing dishes increased my appetite. The GARLIC NAAN was very well done. I loved the strong flavour of garlic which accompanied beautifully the accompaniments. The DAL MAKHANI can be further improved. The CHICKEN CURRY is the twisted version of butter chicken with less sweetness. Should try! the star of the evening was BALTI MUTTON which was spicy, flavourful. I think words fall short. Just stuck the right chords. Thank god the end went well because the DESSERTS were amazing. I absolutely loved PHIRNI and its worth trying! GULAB JAMUN and KHEER could have been improved. I highly appreciated the cordial service that it was given to us. Please incorporate some few changes in the food! My verdict?

They also have the Sholey bike with them, u can click pictures with it and make ur dining experience memorable. The food and dtinks menu consist of dhaba style food with a bit of twist. Over to food: Theka style drinks that we had were : Paan Gulabo With Whiskey : Paan pasand type flavour a bit on sweeter side but was good. Verru ki Ghutti : Oh ! What a drink. Sandalwood , Kaffir Lime and Cardamom. You can actually taste three of them in the blend. Must have with or without alcohol. Chulbula Jugnu : Vodka based Kalakhatta flavoured Chuski. Neither tasted kalakhatta nor Vodka. Food : Tandoori Paneer Tikka : The paneer was soft but the marination on it was not cooked properly. Turmeric was too much and can taste the rawness of it. Garam Dharam Special Soya Chaap: Twist to the regular chaap we have. Batter fried with alu masala stuffing in it. But a strong mustard oil smell hits when taken the first bite. Dahi ke Kebab : Flavours were missing as if balls of hung curd are fried and served. Needs spices and modifications. Murgh Kali Mirch Tikka : A fantastic tikka preparation with just the right amount of kali mirch and soft chicken pieces did the wonder. Highly Recommend. Andhra Chicken : Kind if chicken 65 taste. Was definitely good. With Curry leaves and mustard seeds giving a different flavour this dish is recommended. Lassi : Amazing Lassi. We tried Mango , Peach and Saffron lassi. Both were equally good. Perfect thick and sweet. Chicken Curry : More like butter chicken , was good. Balanced flavours but dhaba style. Balti Meat : Mutton Curry with no show sha. Soft melt in mouth mutton pieces which have soaked the flavours of the gravy. A must have. Martaban Dal Makhni : I expected more butter or cream in it but apart from that the dal was good. More creaminess required. Flavours were all balanced. Garlic Cheese Naan : Though I had a different picture in my mind and could not find cheese in it.But if you say it as garlic naan it was awesome. Lacchha Parantha : Soft parantha with methi on it. Was good. For Desserts we had Dharam Veer kesar kheer , Gulab Jamun and Phirni. Out of which phirni was the show stopper. Must order Phirni.

If you're here, id recommend the andhra chicken ( a desi take on chicken 65) and pyare mohan (that's a mocktail) . All other items i ate here can be missed out on! The afghani chicken tikka was passable. Dahi k kebabs were a let down. The mains made me sad. As i took one bite , each of the dal makhni, mutton and chicken, i wasnt in the mood to eat anymore.

The whole decor resolves around his movies and things that you typically find in a dhaba setting. I was at Garam Dharam for a review lunch, which didn't go as expected. For starters, DAHI KE KABAB : This is what you get when you simply deep fry mixture of dahi and other ingredients. Tasteless, Totally Avoidable! TANDOORI SOYA CHAAP : Soya Chaap was crisp on the outside, and high on spices. MURG KAALI MIRCH : I have always liked Murgh Kaali Mirch. And this was the best that I've had till date. Juicy, big pieces of chicken; with the right taste of kaali mirch kicking in! *Sip Up* I tried their PARIMAL'S PAAN GULABO, with WHISKEY: Paan tastic and quite refreshing, could hardly feel the whiskey; but definitely a hit. Loved the bottles in which it was served (See picture) LASSI : Going by the kind of place, I was excited to try on the lassi. Under Special Lassi, SAFFRON AND PEACH had little of peach and more of saffron, which was quite heavy as it came in a huge glass! Finish it up till its chilled. *Main Course* CHICKEN CURRY : The gravy was really sweet, It wouldn't be wrong to say that it was modified butter chicken! BALTI MEAT : As the name suggests, it was served in a small balti (bucket), and tasted delicious. Perfectly cooked pieces, with rich gravy. *Desserts* PHIRNI takes the day away!

When asked for a reason, simply answered 'restaurant policies'. What ? Are we a threat after 6 p.m. and not before that? Or is this a club where you need to maintain a sex ratio ?

Honestly, I liked the dcor and the whole dhaba scene and setting with a huge painting of dharmendra and quirky tables and chairs and good lightings. The food here was a little disappointing. The two starters that I liked was andhra chicken and Afghani chicken and the paneer tikka was okay-ish. Otherwise the Dahi ke Kebabs or the soya chaap was a good option for the vegetarians. In the main course I liked the chicken gravy a little and I liked the mushroom mix. Mutton gravy had a weird smell in it which was a big turn off. The dessert included gajar ka halwa which was not at all sweet and the gulab Jamun was good. I would like to suggest that you guys should improve the quality of food a little more and only then you will give justice to the name. The quirky bottles which are used to serve mocktails were the highlight of the entire dinner and my favorite was pyaare mohan.

Natasha Ahuja,"Rated Garam Dharam is located at one of the best locations in connaught place. The place is inspired by the glitz and glamour of bollywood Dharmendra in particular. The entire place is based on his movies and songs. With drinks like whisky fukrey and Chulbuli will simply blow your mind. The murg kali mirch tikka was absolutely delicious in taste,soft and juicy chicken goes best with drinks. The mixed seekh kebab was a new dish for me. It was good in taste too. The best dish for me was the Andhra Chicken it was basically Chicken 65 had the flavour of red chillies was delectable in taste. For main course we had Chicken Curry and Balti meat were good.

Saurav Bansal,"Rated Garam Dharam, a theme based restaurant with ambiance copied from Dharam bhaji's movies mostly from Sholay. The ambiance was good and the music as well. A huge waitlist and got seats only after 30 mins. Expectations were high after seeing the ambiance and waitlist. A disappointment show started as the place was over crowded with seat to close to each other. But still seemed that punjabi food must be delicious. Ordered some Dal/Paneer/Mashroom with high spirits to get spicy food as punjabi's like. The service was so poor that they served the food after an hour. After looking at the dishes all seems alike. The taste was also disappointing as it looks. None of the 5 dishes was good. In short a big disappointment. Bad service, expensive food, no tasty food at all and crowded place. Music and ambiance (Village touch) was good. Big no for the next time visit.",Rated 2.0,3,17,??
Sargun Matta,"Rated Amazing ambience with disgusting food and pathetic service! I visited the outlet a few days ago with my family, and we were made to wait for around 45 minutes before being allowed inside. The ambience and the surroundings were great! the starters looked great but were serve cold. And then moving on to the main course, we ordered chicken makhani, which was served to us without salt. And the paneer we ordered had strands of hair stuffed in it and by the time they could provide us with fresh food, the breads turned cold. When we informed the staff about it, and asked them to call their manager, they straight away ignored our plea, and turned a blind eye towards us. They made me question myself, am I a fool to pay so much for this quality of food and is this the kind of service I expect from a restaurant for which I had to wait for 45 minutes on the road. P.s-I feel that they should at least change their name and their interiors a bit so that they don't bring such utter shame to such a great personality.",Rated 1.0,1,7,??

FOODSTER,"Rated Garam Dharam , theka te dhaba opened up with a lot of buzz sometime bacK. The concept i believe is very innovative and is bollywood theme inspired of an old films style theka and dhaba seen in the movies of legendary actor Dharmendra ji. The walls adorn the dialogues and the pics of the Dharam paaji himself. The beautiful painting of Dharam ji is a highlight of the ambiance. The lamps in the inverted baltis too are quite unique The desi theka style drinking concepts are quite innovative as cocktails named , PYARE MOHAN , KHATTI MITHI CHULBULI , JAWANI BHARI GULABO are served in desi pauvas( small bottles). The alcoholic iced chuskis are also something one would love to try.The pricing of the alcoholic drinks are also reasonable. However , the punjabi food fails to impress. We in a group of 6 tried out a variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian starters namely CHICKEN MALAI TIKKA , TANDOORI MURGH , SOYA TIKKA AND A TANDOORI PLATTER. The starters were pretty mediocre , some of them were dry , others lacked balance in taste. ANANAS KI CHAAT was an excellent starter though, perfectly tangy and sweet at the same time. The main course too failed to impress. The keema mutton was too oily , The kadhai paneer was the saddest dish on the table . Dal makhani was fairly decent. GULAB JAMUN was soft but should have been a little more warm. The service is an area which needs to be looked at by the management. The time of service of food was too long. We had to wait too much for the food to arrive, and also had to wait for the repeat orders to be taken . All in all a place which i had high expectation from but failed to give me a good experience.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Expected a lot from this place by seeing the wait list but the place was a BIG dissapoitnment. The place was overcroweded. The service was extremely bad. Snacks were very okay, nothing special. Main course was not up to the mark. Variety was very limited since most of the items were not available. The only good thing about this place was the interior and slow music. Looks like while staying in Bombay, our Dharam paaji forgot how North Indian food really tastes like. This place is always full just because of the name. You guys should really do something about your service and customer experience. Never visiting here again and will not suggest this place to anyone. Waste of time and money!",Rated 2.5,10,91,??

Ankit Nanavati | The F&B Project,"Rated Cold winter night, in a different city, you leave work famished, almost lifeless. The one part of your head wins the argument and you decide to head to CP (Connaught Place) - the hub of F&B choices in Delhi. We, agreed to pull over at next North Indian restaurant we see and eureka we found Garam Dharam! Flashing yellow bulbs arranged to read 'GARAM DHARAM'. On a Monday night, the place had spilling crowd. The moment we set foot inside, we were blown. The place has lifesize graffiti of Dharmendra. Another wall that read the names of his films. Speakers playing his blockbuster tracks. The atmosphere was vibrant and over the top. Full on filmy. And if the ambience was not impressive enough, they brought us the food. Subz Seekh Kebabs were succulent. The taste was impeccable. For the mains, we relished Amritsari Chole - luscious and authentic, with pyaaz ke Kulche. What blew me off my senses was the Dal Makhani. A first morsel and it was established. This is how you do it. Cooked overnight in an earthen pot richly infused with desi makhan. Dal makhani as good as it can be. The Watermelon Mint Lassi - a very creative drink, was the perfect palate cleanser that allowed me to eat till my hearts content. It's beautiful how the pursuit of good food can be so generously rewarded. And whereas if not in Delhi.

Prerona Basu,"Rated My friend invited us for his birthday treat so my review might be a little prejudiced as I didn't pay for the food ! The space is huge, noisy, loud with waiters, food, drinks, families jostling for space. And this was a Wednesday ! The only one at peace with all the chaos was dharmendra , smiling from all possible angles. This if anything is a dcor designed for the big bollywood star. If there is anything for which I will return to this place, am sure even Dharam Paji will agree with me, is the price of the beer. 80 bucks for a pint in a upscale restaurant in Delhi. Long live the Indian Super man I wish him and his restaurant well. Then there is the Galoti Kabab / Kakori Kabab. I had it in Chandni Chowk, Tundey Kababi as it's known in Lucknow and everywhere in between but this was the way the nawab liked it and his khansama dreamt it. It was so perfectly soft, succulent and fragrant that there is no possible way to outdo it. Next came the Tandoori Chicken which was good but then thats how it is in my kitchen and everywhere else in Delhi. The Naan was soft though the entire course of dinner (Thats how I measure the quality and worth of a Naan) and undoubtedly it earns a 5 star for that. In main course we had Lal Maas and Mutton Balti ( Preparation from a namesake province in Pakistan). The Gravies were exactly same with the only difference of the later being served in a small Balti ( Bucket). Lassi's were served in huge glasses hopefully keeping the Dharam Paji sentiments alive. The service was reasonably polite keeping in mind the eagerly awaiting hungry and cold Delhi-ites queuing up outside. #GaramDharam, #RestaurantsInCP.",Rated 3.5,16,58,??

From the entrance to the walls , everything is painted in the Dharmendra colour. Coming on food , the quality , service justifies the long queues outside this place. I found this place little pricey.

Sanjay Grover,"Rated Visited this place for Dinner two days ago. It has a very good seating capacity yet it was almost packed at 8pm. In fact when we left at 11:15pm, there were many people waiting to get in. It's rightly called Dhaba Te Theka. They have dhaba style feel and serve whiskey in a quarter (180ml) or above. You can't even order 30ml, 60ml etc. As expected, due to it's name, it has Dharmendra pictures all over the restaurant. We ordered for Murg Kaali Mirch, Tandori Masala Chicken Wings, Tandoori Fish and Butter Chicken. Fish was excellent, Wings and Butter Chicken were good, however we didn't like Murg Kaali Mirch. Starters were served pretty quickly but they took a long time to serve our main course.

Firstly there service sucked big time. Despite calling the waiter a million times he didn't respond. Finally we had to go up to him and ask him to take our order. The ambience being that of a dhaba the food didn't do any justice. Bad I must say. We ordered paneer tikka which looked and tasted stale. Dahi k kebab were just fine. Their dsl makhni was the worst I've had till date and chicken tawa I don't even want to talk about. Disappointment!!! We ordered two lassis the only relief was the saffron lassi the rooh afzah again wasn't as per our liking. A waste to money. Except for the ambience nothing really excited me about the place.

Walls are replete with images and posters of Dharmendra, and the ambiance has been created to give the impression of a theka cum drinking place from 80s. The music is mostly old Bollywood. The food is average and most of the items on the menu are usually not available. Basically you are spoilt by choice only to be forced to order what they have.

The naans were came like proper dhaba style big peaces.

Another thing is the pricing.we ordered five thalis and two lassis and the bill came up to around 5000.and honesty I don't feel it was worth it at all.ive eaten better and cheaper thalis.all in all making ur restaurant look fancy is another thing.But maintaining hygiene is the most important thing especially when your charging so much.",Rated 1.0,1,64,??

Also, I thought it was a great option for families. Its basically a hip version of Pind Balucchi. We tried the Chicken Curry which was really good but the quantity was less. Who serves 3 pieces? Here is why this place fails: A super huge menu but half of the items are not available. I literally had to ask them 'Bhai kya mil jaega abhi?' The drinks is another let down. So they have these funky desi cocktails - which is good. And they are relatively cheap. But if I want to have plain Whisky and soda, I have to take minimum 180ml (a quarter).

We ordered a chicken malai tikka, chicken curry, dal makhani and some breads to go with it. The food came in typical dhabba kind of utensils and we were given thallis. The malai tikka was just about average but the chicken curry an the dal makhani were really good and satisfied my craving for good Mughlai food. The breads were fresh and crisp.

Shrehan Gupta,"Rated Garam Dharam as the name suggests is built around Dharam jis bollywood journey. i went here for dinner with my family on a Thursday night and had to wait for almost 20-25 minutes probably because its new and the fake hype this place has created. This place istotally a family restaurant though the moderately loud music is a negative for me when i consider family dining but it kind of blends in with the ambiance and the theme of Dharam Ji. The ambiance is very desi, a successful attempt of fusing a dhaba and a restaurant with Dharam Ji written all over the place. Though the interiors are appealing they lack a bit of innovation with the hanging bucket lights and heavy metal plates.Drinks being served in Desi sharab bottles is a new thing Coming to the food i ordered Dahi Kebabs, Galauti Kebabs, Pindi Choley, Kadhi Pakora, Chicken Curry and a mix of breads which according to the place were not up to the mark. The Dahi Kebabs were cooked right but were a little bland, the Galauti Kebabs had a crisp crust and lacked the melting in the mouth feeling typical of a Galauti Kebab, the Kadhi Pakora and the Pindi Choley were good adequately spiced, the chicken curry was nothing that you expect in a restaurant or something for which you'll spend the chicken pieces were cooked properly but still lacked tenderness and the breads, even though it seemed like that they are preparing these fresh the dough used was fermented only typical of a khameeri roti and not of tandoori rotis or naans moreover you dont't expect fresh, hot rotis to stretch. The service is quick and all the staff is very polite but while in a restaurant i don't expect myself to ask for water more than once that too when you have opted for regular water. I know the place has a dhaba feel with all the desi interiors and the dishes on the menu but it's NOT a dhaba. I would simply rate the food a poor 1.0 and service a 1.5but i liked the ambiance and the whole Dharam Ji concept so i rate it 2.5.",Rated 2.5,15,89,??

Thefoodiebiker,"Rated Garam Dharam, dhaba Te theka, had an eye on this one since it opened. Today we made it. Were in CP and went there for lunch. Bollywood theme based on the legendary hero Dharam Ji. Not classy like themed restaurants, but you cant complain the tag line is Dhaba and Theka. So its other way around. It can be described as classy dhaba and theka. Love the decor can be better. Its all about Dharam ji and his filmy journey. There is no place, where you cant feel the presence of Dharam ji. The bucket lights are good not new though. They have a nice portrait of the man himself. And lot of pictures and things used in his movies. Sitting is bit rustic. Its a big place. Even the bar is in theka style which I really like. The presentation of food and drinks is really good. It gives you desi feel. Being a Punjabi kid, I love this vibe. Drinks served in bottles (pauwas). Loved the fact that, their serving starts with Patiala peg. Its a pity they dont have much to offer in Cocktails, mocktails and Banta is still in production. The other drawback they dont offer you all the food items on the menu. This is kind of a negative for a restaurant. Either you dont print it or you serve what is printed. The staff is courteous. They do greet you with smile and wait on you very patiently while you go through their gorgeous menu. Explain dishes to you and help you choose if you are in dilemma. The food and drinks we ordered today: 1. Chatka Matka Chameli (vodka) :: Its a traditional take on chusky with vodka. Consist of mint, tamarind chutney and few spices. You can have it without Alcohol. The taste was good. This chusky stuff is very popular with ladies. Fun way to have Alcohol. 2. Khatti Meethi Chulbuli (vodka) : Another desi cocktail with Kokum, rock salt and roasted zeera. Didnt hit the mark with vodka in it. May be good as mocktail. 3. Payarey Mohan Masala Nimbu (vodka): Like this one. Masaledar Nimbu with almond flavor. Go well with vodka. And taste good without alcohol as well. 4. Dhaba Chicken Tikka: As suggested by them. So we ordered it. It was ok. Good color and taste. Yup spicy but chicken was bit dry. It was bit disappointing. It can be much better, only if the chicken is tender and succulent. 5. Tandoori Paneer Tikka: It was good. Paneer was soft and moist. Properly done and evenly spiced. 6. Rajma Masala: For a surprise after a long time I had tasty Rajma in any joint. It was creamy in texture, cooked to perfection and just the right amount of spice in it. 7. Jeera Rice: Rice was good. Nice separate grains. Well cooked with nice aroma. 8. Kadhai Chicken: Loved this one. The right amount spice to kick your taste buds. The chicken was cooked well, tender, soft and moist. For breads we have butter naan, lacchha prantha(hari mirch). Both were good. Loved he mint chutney and pickle. For desert we had Gulab Jamun. Which they dont charge. Over all loved the joint. Average priced. All this cost us 3048 buck with a bottle of water and all taxes included. Love to visit again and try few other things.

Portion of dishes was good , Desserts : gulab jamun , amazing ! They do not have much options in mock-tales , i only impressed by their presentation otherwise I didn't like their mock-tales at all , seriously disgusting ! We had parimal's paan gulabo , veeu di ghutti and virgin mojito , none of them was good in taste ! Service : service was quick , i went there for lunch , so no idea about services in the dinner timings. Money : Nominal charges ! Best place for people who want good food in best prices !

The interiors are done in a dhaba style decor and pays tribute to yesteryear star Dharmendra. The management has put on a great show as far as innovative interiors and menu is concerned. But the buck stops here. The food is terrible and served cold. Yes, they have fancy and funny names of the cocktails on the menu but the bartender cannot churn a decent mojito. Dal makhani and chicken dishes are below average. The breads served were taken out of tandoor pre maturely. The restrooms were stinking of puke. Except for the presentation of the whole ""Garam Dharam"" concept, the place is definately not to be visited again.

Culinary Delites,"Rated It was a normal afternoon routine for the Delhiites at Connaught Place on 9th September, made special by the inauguration of a themed-restaurant Garam Dharam Dhaba te Theka by Umang Tewari and Mickey Mehta and the presence of the veteran actor Dharmendra himself gracing the occasion. The restaurant is a first of its kind in the capital city and represents the vibrant personality of Dharmendra along with some Bollywood tadka. The interiors and the decor is rustic just like a dhaba is but with a contemporary twist given to the food and drinks. The music is foot tapping numbers from Dharmendras movies and his legendary dialogues and scenes from the movies find their place on upholsteries and walls either in the form of graffiti or posters. One of the decor pieces is the iconic bike from the movie Sholay. Talking about the theme and the idea behind the restaurant, Umang Tewari, said, Fun, quirky, lively, innovative & foodies paradise are just the few words to describe first of its kind Dharam Garam. Bollywood veteran Dharmendra is everybody's favourite and has been ruling heart since his young days, his movies, his dialogues and his songs are legendary, keeping this in mind I thought to give capital its first restaurant inspired by veteran actor. So if you are a Bollywood fan and love your food with equal passion then this place is definitely for you. Spread over an area of 4000 square feet, Dharam Garam is one stop place for all those who love good food, good music and quirky interiors. The quirkiness of the place starts right from the entrance where the posters of Dharmendras popular movies and renowned dialogues greet the customers. Adding to the quirkiness quotient is an entire wall dedicated to the graffiti of his dialogues and of course Dream Girl, said Mr Tewari. He further said that when it comes to food, Delhiites want to have it the best, so the endeavour is to make this place foodies heaven. By giving this restaurant a contemporary dhaba look the owners aim to raise the quirkiness and the fun quotient, as the entire ambience is of a Dhaba Te theka but right in the centre of the national capital. The ambience of the place is quite rustic with iron buckets turned upside down and used as lamp shades. A true Jat and a simple man at heart, Dharmendra said that he never in his wildest dreams imagined that he would have a restaurant in his name and that too in Central Delhi. He said at the inauguration, I am humbled by the idea of a themed-restaurant, as over the years I have acquired various tags including 'Action Man', He-Man' and even 'Garam Dharam', for which I am thankful to everybody,"" Continuing in his jovial, no starry tantrums attitude, Dharamendra said, I will talk to all of you present here like I would talk to my friend. I will share some memories from my past and you tell me yours. With that he proceeded to talk about his first visit to a five-star restaurant. He narrated how he asked for a whiskey from the waiting staff and the staff asked him whether he would like single or double malt. To this Dharamendra replied, I dont know about this single or double thing, I just want to have whiskey. So the staff went and got me whiskey in a glass and I couldnt understand whether it was for drinking or to be poured in your ears, as here I was used to drinking whiskey straight from the bottle and here the staff is getting me a glass half-full of whiskey. Dharamendras simplicity again came forth when the same waiting staff brought him a knife and fork to eat the Indian cuisine he had ordered and he said, I thought to myself, desi khaane ka mazaa jo haath se khane mein aata woh kahan inn chhuri kaante mein milta hai. (Indian food or any food for that matter is best enjoyed when eaten with your hands rather than eating with a knife and a fork). He kept all of us entertained with his iconic stories from the past and expressed his gratitude for all the love audiences have ever shown him and is still showering on him. And invited all of us to Garam DharamDhaba te theka for some casual dining with friends and family. Thus passing on the mike again to the owners who told us about the future plans of the restaurant oops dhaba! Mickey Mehta told the media about the unique Dhaba Dabbas, which the dhaba would soon be starting and they (the owners) are sure that it will be an instant hit, as there are several commercial buildings where such services are always needed. Another unique feature of the dhaba will be the take-away or To-go counters. Talking about drinks, the owners said in unison that the dhaba has some quite interesting mocktails and desi drinks, which again will be loved by one and all. Thus Garam Dharam is for all those people who just want the best at best prices! With the hope that they get loads of acceptance from the city crowd who love their food, the owners said, We are sure we will get lot of acceptance for Dharam Garam, as there is no compromise on anything and thus ensuring to give our customers one of the best experiences that they will cherish. This is place suitable for all age groups. It is a warm, cozy, comfortable Dhaba Te Theka style restaurant where each meal is a treasured time to relax and share a bounty of wonderful food with family and friends. As a parting shot, Mr Mehta added that they are on the mission to numerous theme and concept based restaurants in Delhi and many of them within this year. So what are you guys waiting for just head to Garam Dharam Dhaba te Theka for some good food, drinks, fun and entertainment. So happy wolfing everyone!

Devanshi Sharma,"Rated Food: 4/5 Ambiance:4.5/5 Service: 4.5/5 Value for money: 4.5/5 I went here on a Sunday evening. There was a long waiting queue but we had passes n privilege to jump it. As soon as we entered.. Omg..! Interiors are done beautifully.. I've never seen something like this before. They were inspired by Dharam paaji n probably his movies. They played good music too. We ordered dahi kebab, paneer tikka and hara bhara kebab for the starters and alcohol. The service was very quick. The presentation of the food and drinks was good. But dahi kebab and paneer tikka wasn't warm enough. The taste was good though. I loved hara bhara kebab. For main course we ordered dal makhani, mix veg and soya chaap. Dal makhani n mix veg could have been better but soya chaap was amazing. Chap was soft n gravy was soooooo goood. We didn't order any desserts. The price of food and alcohol is fair. Although food can be better, at least it should be served warm enough. They have some interesting combinations in their bar menu. They have alcoholic bantas and chuskis. I'll try them the next time.",Rated 4.5,33,401,??

Anyway the place I have been told is new and owner by Dharmendar and sons! I liked the Dhabh-decor but nothing new that I have not seen. I mean horn ok please walls with buckets hanging upside down is so 2010!! The food was good. I ordered chole; (really good), my signature dish Kurkuri bhindi (pretty decent), Kadai Paneer (passable) and Soya Chaps (nothing too spectacular!) The service was so slow and so confused that we ended up canceling a couple of dishes! The food is not that bad and it's a decent place to go and try with family.

Tathagat Choudhary,"Rated Came across the outlet searching for a place to sit peacefully and have a nice lunch. First thing which attracted me was the name. As the name suggested the cuisine was Punjabi. The interiors have been done smartly and creatively. The first order of the day was Khatti Meethi Chulbuli (a must have). Not wanting to exercise the grey matters we just decided to order the Thali. The food was decent the portions were adequate in size. The thali consisted of Two Veg Dishes, Two Non Veg Dishes, Dal, Raita, Kheer accompanied by the breads and rice. Dal makhni served was really nice. The deduction of points are for the painfully slow service and the plates on which the Thali was served. It was a huge plate making it difficult for two people to sit opposite each other. My suggestion to fellow foodies pls do not order the thali it's very uncomfortable to eat on. The food is nice so Ala Carte is suggested.

Atul Bhandari,"Rated So after hearing lots about this place, we finally landed up at Garam Dharam on Friday evening for dinner at 8 pm. The first thing that attracts you are the rustic interiors. The place has a buzz about it and was rocking with Dharam songs. The drinks menu is very interesting and the tharra type presentation with some interesting concoctions is outstanding. We ordered the chulbuli drink with vodka and it was very nice. For appetisers, we ordered the soya chaap, hara bara kebab and Sahi kebab. Two things about appetisers - the portions are huge (7-8 pieces each) and the taste and balance of spices was quite good. The service is also quite fast as our appetisers were served within 10 minutes. For dinner, we only ordered dal makhni, veg biryani and roti. The dal makhni had a somewhat different but fresh flavour - quite tasty actually. Overall, Garam Dharam is a good addition to the CP food scene.

An amazing range of mocktails and cocktails with even more interesting names make the place worth a visit. I ordered khatti meethi chulbuli and dahi k kebab which were soft enough to melt in my mouth. The pindi sholey served with amritsari kulcha are just the perfect thing to fulfil your appetite.

We agreed and came back around 9.40 pm after which we were told that we'd have to wait for some more time. Finally around 10.05 we were told that they finally had a table for the five of us. We thought finally our ordeal had ended but we were so wrong. We weren't even served with water or given a menu till 10.20! Finally we ordered some basic dal makhani and butter chicken, but our food didn't arrive until 11.05 pm!

Well NONE I would like to shout & repeat NONE of the things served to us was hot. Yes you are reading it right we were served ice cold food disregard of mentioning us about d coldness of the food d repeated rotis were equal to papad.

When we enter it was really a great pleasure for us to see Raw interiors. Dharam paaji' portrait on a wall, dream girl, Bike, Theka, quirky names in menu Now food, firstly I ordered masala chaap in starters & it was rightly roasted, soft & tasty. Beverages, Lemon Soda steal the show. They served it in Pauwe ki bottle. Amazing We had both Mitthi & Namkeen Lassi. Then comes the main course, Dal Makhani as my favorite was so tasty as I had 2 bowls. Mai Balwan Family Naan was also nice. Kadhai Paneer was not good, no one from us liked it.

Tried it last weekend and they had a 2 hour waiting... We ordered our food and though I was expecting very slow service but our starters were served quite quickly. But The drinks took some time and so did the main course. They r slow even when the restaurant was not full...no wonder the long waiting on the weekend! The music was good and interiors interesting. Nothing good to write about the food. It was actually quite average. Lesser known places serve much much better food. The helpings are small and the food was just tepid. We asked for more breads and they took a long time to serve those and by then the dishes were all cold. Toilets are dirty.

Nisha Bhatt,"Rated I recently visited this place with my friends for lunch after hearing all the hype about it. At first I thought it would actually have the ""dhaba"" vibe to it, but it turned out to be a little different, and I mean that in an ""OK"" way. The ""restaurant"" is decorated decently but it's got yellow lights all over, so for people who want to take pics and selfies, the photos will not turn out nice. We were four people so we ordered some starters like ""dahi ke kebab"", ""dhaba tikka"" and murg malai tikka along with a few drinks like ""lassi:, a ""fresh lime soda"" and some other mocktail. Then we ordered some mains like ""laccha parathas"" and ""roomali rotis"" along with a ""paneer dish"" and a ""chicken curry"". The food was alright, I wouldn't say it was great or delicious. I've had better starters and food at my local small eatery/joint. The roomali rotis were good though. Better than I've had. The worst part about my experience here was the service. The service was utterly slow. We almost starved ourselves to death. The restaurant was jam packed, so maybe that could be a reason but it was a huge negative. A plus point here is that the food isn't too expensive. We were four people and with food and drinks (non alcoholic), our bill was about 3,045/-. Given a choice, I would not like to come here again. Although you can come here for an experience once. I'd rather you try ""dhaba food"", if you want some good quick dhaba food at the Kake da Hotel in CP itself.

I think there is a mindset involved in the minds of the owners of these type of restaurant that by the time hype for their concept is over and people realize that good food is the every essence of a good restaurant they would have realised their investment and moved on to some other venture to fool the ever eager public of Delhi. Please don't waste your money and more importantly your time in these facebook restaurants. I would also like to ask the management what is the basis of their charging 10% service charge 0%-5% is the norm. If I am happy with the service I would tip the waiter.

Ankit Arora,"Rated Cp's first Bollywood actor themed restaurant, inspired and owned by Dharam paaji! Well, obviously it had to be him or Big B, so no surprises here.. The decor of the place reminds you of the era of 1960s,adding to which is the in-house music played with all tracks taken from dharam paaji's movies..( what I experienced on my first visit.In subsequent visits, I have heard bohemia to badshah to to baby doll and what not..something I did not like as it doesn't go well with the atmosphere) With walls adorned with dharmu's posters, the staff wearing traditional clothes with his famous dialogues (some from behind-the truck:-D) imprinted on them, the punjab-pind style seating arrangements, food being served in thaalis and pauua bottles for the drinks, fancy headlamps etcetra do complete justice to the theme.. Only few in the staff are courteous and soft spoken, rest all carry that angry-young-man attitude..the service is okish with average time for a dish to be served being 15 min. What at this place disappointes the most is the food..not that they are real bad at preparing or presenting it, it's just that is simply plain with little innovation ,also sometimes defying logic. For example the veg and non veg thalis are what your mum would cook for you..nothing special about them..u'l rather relish the home made food more..The non veg thali costs an exorbitant 700 bucks while it's veg counterpart costs 400 , with the only difference being chicken tikka replacing planner tikka nd chicken curry instead of the paneer one., that too both made in same spices , cooked together..difficult to comprehend the logic behind the significant price difference! Then the meat isn't well cooked either..not succulent, rather rubbery.. Then the ananas chaat: believe it or not it has 2 pieces of ananas with gobhi and whatnot.. Don't know where the recipe comes from! Mohan pyare is a decent beverage with almond tinge to it. Sweet lassi is good as it should be, for such a place going wrong with lassi would be curtains down right away! Complementary buttermilk is too oily though pleasing to the taste buds. They serve a 300 ml coke for Rs60plus taxes...still have those bubbles gurgling in my stomach..! Dahi ke kebab is another ordinary preparation..

All the famous lines of Dharmendra Ji has been written on the cushions, scooter, walls etc.... We went on Saturday afternoon and the place was quite full....We ordered some beverages- Khatti meethi chulbuli, Pyare Mohan masala nimbu and fresh lime soda... The khatti meethi chulbuli was a kokam based drink and was really nice and soothing... The masala nimbu however was quite chatpata and very different in taste... Drinks has been served in pauvva style!!! For the main course we ordered baingan bharta, aloo gobhi, dal makhani, Tawa soya chaap, pineapple raita and some breads.... First of all, the food took approximately 25 min to reach our table which was really sad.... Baingan bharta has been prepared like Dhabha style...aloo gobhi again was really nice, dal makhani somehow was a real let down... It was just a normal dal with some cream... Tawa soya was again good but I feel that the soya supposed to be cook more.... Pineapple raita was average.. In breads we tried some rumali roti which was average and the size was quite fine, then we had some Tawa roti with ghee which was good, the tandoori rotis was quite nice and moist...

Richa Sharma,"Rated Happened to visit this place on a Saturday evening with a friend. There were people waiting outside in a queue for their turn. All thanks to Dharam ji's huge fan following. I too had high expectations of this restaurant but to my sheer surprise I was disappointed. More than 70% of the items listed on the menu were not available. They hardly have anything for vegetarians and teetotallers. So, we ended up ordering stuff which we didn't really want because of lack of options. The portion size of the food was not decent and the service was also bad. The waiters had no clue about the dishes, and were not very courteous too. :( Before opening a restaurant, one must ensure that the items listed on the menu are available. We paid close to 700 bucks for just one flavoured lassi, paneer tikka and one stuffed kulcha. Ambience wise, the restaurant-cum-dhaba is nice but as far as the food and services are concerned, it was a total disaster.

Apurva Setia,"Rated Ever since this place opened up, its been all over the radio , social media and newspapers. So we decided to give it try and we wrnt disappointed at all. I went on a weekday for lunch. From outside, it just looks like any other restaurant but when you step inside, its really impressive. They've put so much thought in the everything from the interiors, the cutlery, the menu and the bar which looks lovely by the way. It's got the look of a dhaba but a Lavish one of course. It's got 2 floors with sufficient seating. Colourful lights but dimly lit. Coming to food, I don't usually order a full veg meal but I was with a couple of friends, all vegetarians! so yeah. We ordered the Dahi k kebab and subs seekh kebab. The Dahi kebabs were extremely soft. Literally melting in the mouth. The seekh kebab was delicious too. Moving on to the main course, we ordered the Amritsari pindi sholey from the Dharam ji's special part of the menu and mushroom mutter Masala along with some butter naan. The pindi sholey was just the right amount of spicy and it came along with Amritsari kulcha. The mutter mushroom tasted super. Both the things were pretty tasty. I've never enjoyed VEG north Indian food so much ever. They serve everything in the simple metal plates and bowls along with lots of onions and green mint chutney which adds on to their concept. The drinks menu is really really interesting. We only ordered the Pyaare mohan nimbu from the mocktail menu. It was nimbu masala with almond flavour which came in cool bottle. For desserts, we had the phirni. Nothing extraordinary but nice. The only thing that I didn't quite like was the service which was slow and it wasn't easy to get the waiter's attention even though there were few tables occupied. My second visit was ruined a little because of the shabby service. They MUST improve their service.

We were fine with waiting but as a customer courtesy they could have offered us to sit inside instead of standing in Sun. The service was too slow and definitely needs attention. Ambiance - Now this deserves 5/5, a perfect ambiance , well planned and good music. Food/Drinks - Food is one of the key factors for a restaurant and our expectation was much higher from Dharam ji. Anyhow, the food was average nothing special about the food except the fancy names given to the dishes and menu items. The quantity was too low as compared to price. Welcome drink was good. Drinks were fine as expected, specially the Khas mock-tail served as Veeru ki Ghutti so called specialty of the place. Also to add on they could replace sauf and mishri served with bill to something more ethnic to there Punjabi theme like guud. So overall experience was pleasant, had good time with team. Would be good if they can work upon quantity of food or price basis the quantity they serve. We had a total of 8500 out of which the bill was for 6500 approx and rest all taxes.",Rated 3.0,8,0,??

Priyanka Ved,"Rated Garam Dharam is the latest talk of the town. A newly opened restaurant which am not sure is a dedication to Dharamendra ji or owned by him but it does reflect him in a lot of ways. The ambience is totally desi which I really liked and gives you a feel of a 5 star dhaba, there are Hindi songs playing in the background which are mostly the unplugged version and the volume is not too loud so you can have a conversation and also enjoy the songs. They do not serve alcohol in less than 180ml quantity, so be prepared to have at least that amount of alcohol. Coming to the food I'll say that it was fine and can be better. Staff was courteous but service was just fine. Something that was upsetting was that they didn't had cool soft drink and water bottles on a hot Saturday evening. So may be they can work on that.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Completely white i mean totaly white saltless puree with boiled pieces of chicken that too 3 only.If you are planning to eat NAN den order one extra as Naan is in the size of chapati.PLZ DONT ORDER MOCKTAIL..YOU WILL REPENT AND REMEBER ME..We ordererd ""VIRRU KI GUTHI"" and ""PYARE MOHAN MASALA NIMBU"" and it was so pathetic that no one can wash their hand with these so called MOCKTAILS and they were served in bottles which people usually get in theka in rural areas but as they say ""ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD"" holds true for ""Garam Dharam"".They are just cashing on the name of Yesteryear superstar and 1ST macho man of India ""DHARMENDRA"" and spoiling it.I m big of him so i do not want his name and image should be tarnished with some money making restraunt whose aim is to make money and spoil other people taste.Guys take my advice and dont go there and if u accidently visit this place then do share your feedback here,as i may be wrong but my taste buds generally do not betray me since they are dead for sometime after having the white boiled chicken so waiting for there retreival to try different restraunt till then ke liye bye and all the best if you are still going GARAM DHARAM..",Rated 1.0,1,10,??
MOVISH,"Rated A shrine to the popular veteran cine actor- our very own Dharam Paaji,Garam Dharam dhaba te theka delights you as you step in.The interiors are an Ode to the handsome He Man of Bollywood... his movies are the reference points for the decor which is quirky and speckled with his movie memorabilia.What's not to love about it?The time I spent absorbing the little details of the interiors which are done with a lot of flair ,were the best minutes of my luncheon. Thereafter,all I did was WAIT. Wait to be served water;Wait for someone to take the order;Wait to be told the street food chef is on leave(they didn't know that till 2pm?);Wait for the starters;Wait for the roomali rotis while our kebabs grew cold;Wait for the bill;Wait for the bill to be corrected;Wait for the bill to be collected.Phew!! Not that I was in any tearing hurry,infact,was out for lunch to catch up with a friend after a long time.To be fair ,a server did say when we entered that they were running low on staff that particular day.But surprisingly, there seemed to be no dearth of man power,what was glaringly absent was a coordination among the servers,many of whom were unable to pre empt simple guest needs .Also obvious was the lack of communication between the kitchen and the waiting staff.If Garam Dharam can manage their staff resources effectively, it can really shake up the Indian food scene in CP. The prices are reasonable, portions are average and food is robust.Do try their flavoured Lassis,they are light and yummy.Also,their Choley and Amritsari Kulcha are an absolute must if you are a fan of dhabas of Punjabs.Will recommend a visit to enjoy Dharam Paaji s magic,you ll not have to ""Wait"" if you are in luck.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

For the Punjabi food lovers this is a must visit. I loved their Kadai Chicken and murg malai tikka in non veg. In veg, mushroom masala was good and their dal makhni was superb. In the sweet dish Gulab Jamuns were simply irresistible. The dishes are decently priced and hence the place is value for money.

At the end we had to cancel the second starter order. The food was bad.. shahi paneer ws very bad so as the amritsari chole . and the quantity of food ws very less. Guys, a Legend's name is associated with the resturant and eveybody is coming just bcoz of him and the decor otherwise there are 100s of resturants available in CP alone.

You wont find any sort of cheese in Cheese Garlic Naan. Even re-order of roties/Naan takes 10-15 minutes. Staff do not take care of your comfort. It took almost 30-40 minutes for rice and that too after 4-5 reminders. Absolutely pathetic..

The moment one enters, one can find Dharamendra's pictures on the wall along with the Sholay wala scooter placed near the wall. One can also find Dharam paaji's movie dialogues scribbled on the walls. Now coming to the food, the menu looked quite normal. We ordered dal dhaba chhonkh wali, butter chicken, tandoori rotis, kadhai paneer, gud ki meethi roti, lacha parantha and jeera rice. The food took a very long time to arrive. The quantity was also less. Apart from this nothing much to share on the food since it is not high on taste. No recommendations from my side as well.

Shubham Mittal,"Rated I went there on a Tuesday night practically hoping it to be not that crowded but all my practically went wrong and it was totally crowded. We went to the counter and asked for the waiting time and there we got to know we'd have to wait for not less than 45 mins. But since we were determined to eat there we decided to wait but being lucky we got the table within 30 minutes. The ambience has been given a totally raw look , no corner is left where you can't feel the aura of our Indian He-Man , the man himself Dharmendar. All that walls are done keeping him in the mind , movie names , masterpieces used in various films etc. Even the theka is designed exactly the same as designed in Yamla Pagla Deewana as far i could make out. Now coming to the main thing the food. We ordered kadhai paneer , aalo gobhi , Amritsari pindi sholey ( menu says it) , the big family naan , garlic cheese parantha , and tandoori rotis and the special veeru ki ghutti , kesar lassi for drinks. The food as they say is quite good in terms of quality but the main usp of it is the price.@ I don't mind it saying the most affordable Indian restaurant in CP. The quantity of the pindi choley combo is quite good enough to satisfy one hungry soul , the cholle are quite like the ones as they are in dhaba's. Kadhai paneer and aalo gobhi was normal ,nothing special about them as such. Veeru ki ghutti was a very refreshing drink with so much of different spices in it. Its a must have from my side. Lassi was a big tall glass totally chilled with ice and the kesar flavor made it so delightful. Next the service , well it was a huge disappointment. They were not able to cater the whole crowd properly. In a Dhabha you expect service to be really fast but here it was something very opposite to it. We were not served pyaaz chutney until our first round of breads and when we ordered our next round of breads we had to wait for a good amount of time which made our subzi's go cold . The server served us the lassi after we reminded him thrice so yes you can make up about the service itself.",Rated 3.5,18,254,??

Garam dharam-- befitting the actor's lifelong career almost perfectly, the place is a must-try for all Punjabis and Punjabi food lovers! Thankfully, the pre-booking made us skip the long que outside on a Thursday evening. Just guessing the buzz it would be on weekends... Pheww !!! We started with the famous flavoured lassis- Mango and Kiwi lassi. They were served in a huge glass that filled half my tummy right then and tasted truly 'burrrrah punjabi' Coupled with Dahi ke Kebab and Roasted Chicken, we had a hearty look at the beautiful moments recreated around with Dharmender's pictures and painted walls. Next up was the main course with Veg Biriyani, Rara Mutton, Paneer Masaaledaar and the ever-favourite Butter Chicken. Masala Papad, Lachcha Paranthas and Garlic Naans as accompaniment, we could hardly finish everything. But as they, a Punjabi meal is rarely complete without a sweet-dish so we ended up eating the very yummy Gulaabjamuns and Kheer.

The way your staff acted, made me feel like you are giving a sad and lousy dog a bone. I waited almost for 40 minutes and even after numerous reminders, I was not served with what I was expecting for. You really need to learn how to evangelize your customers into regular ones.

Akshat Jain,"Rated Garam dharam is the worst restaurant I have ever come across. I think they have taken dharam's dialogue- 'KUTTE MAIN TERA KHOON PI JAONGA' too seriously. Firstly you have to wait here for seats and once u get your seats then the real torture begins. Waiters are mannerless, they will just roam around and will not listen to you as if they are paying us. Then u order your starters where you get just 3-4 pieces of paneer tikka for 300 bucks and once u order your main course don't expect it to come and you will end up walking out of the restaurant. The manager feels as if he's REAL DHARAM, he doesn't seem to have basic courtesy to say sorry to his clients.

Food was nice, but the problem with the place was that more then 60% of the items in the menu were not present. Be it liquor or food or cocktails. Went with great expectations but disappointed. In the end, the owner compensated us with Veeru ghutti. A must try cocktail. Reasonably priced. Hoping for better service and options availability next time. @",Rated 3.0,58,123,??

Placed an order for masala papad, chicken tikka chaat which tastes identical. Butter chicken had undercooked chicken. Food arrived 50 mins after order placement. The bread arrived an hour or so later. The idea dhaba cuisine is cute. If you're looking for a Bollywood theme and overpriced beer, this is the place for you.",Rated 1.0,4,0,??

Manvir Singh Anand,"Rated Garam Dharam - What a star in the heart of Delhi! Have visited the outlet twice in a week's time now and can't stop gushing about the food, ambiance and of course, the drinks. No doubt, quality speaks for itself. The interiors are well-done and rustic with a contemporary twist, especially the bar area reminds of the one shown in Dharmendra starred ""Yamla Pagla Deewana"". The authentic Punjabi music just adds more vibe to the dining experience. Started with a round of signature cocktail ""Bantas"", some ""He-Man Cola"" was my choice while my friends tried ""Balram"" - I must say the drinks were as unique and unconventional as their names. It's good to see that the cocktails have not been forcefully ""westernized"". Coming to the food, excellent preparation! Starting off with the Tandoori starters, we tried Shammi Kebab & Murgh Kali Mirch. Shammi Kebab was good but the Murgh Kali Mirch was a steal, succulent chicken pieces with a fantastic marination, the flavour of Kali Mirch was robust! The best I've had till date. Then moved straight to maincourse, ordered the Cream Chicken, Balti Meat along with Family Naan. Unlike the buttery, ""Mughlai style"" Punjabi food we have other restaurants, these were actually Desi Ghee preparations, exactly as per Punjabi palate, no gimmicky stuff. Balti Meat especially was relished by my friends'; without exaggeration matches the taste of Ambala's Puran Singh Meat Wala. Try this for sure! Ended the perfect feast, with the sinful Moong Dal Ka Halwa. We ended up shelling ~ INR 1.2 K/head and it was bloddy well worth it! Looking forward to my next visit.Only regret - could not take pictures!Kudoz to the Management for the honesty in their quality and service! Hope it stays the same.",Rated 5.0,1,83,??

Me and my friends waited more than 35mins for 2 sabzi and 4 breeds. Then found a strand of hair in butter. Breeds meant to be soft but they ain't. After that the waiter not even served the water. Let's come to the manager....""ma'am humme abi sirf 2 din hue h, aaj 3rd day hai"" lemme tell you in the starting either I'll say it as a strategy or policy or target....attracting customer is the main motive and target.

Ankit Mal,"Rated Fancy name, amazing ambience but tasteless food and horrible service. I saw there banner near vault cafe around a month back. I was in Cp yesterday and was looking for Northindian food so decided to try it. As we entered we really liked the ambience, steel buckets, kettle used as lights, fancy sitting with sofas, chairs, and bar tables. Up to this point we liked this. As we were only 2 people so got a table for 2. But after that we have to call waiter for giving us menu again and again. There was not much crowd but still they were looking and delegating other waiter to give us menu and water. After several calls we were given the menu. So now have started unliking it. Then we ordered one veg dum biryani, dal makhani, plain Naan and stuffed Naan. Dal was normal in taste but with decent quality but biryani was pathetic, it was like pulao and moreover served in open pan which made it cold in few mins. Stuff Naan was not served as a full Naan rather in pieces. So it was quite a disappointment as we had better options like desi vibes and pind balluci. Please improve the quality of food only ambience and funky name won't attract customers for long.",Rated 2.5,49,237,??

Moreover their uniform had the caption ""sunno sabki karo apni"" - which is the lamest thing i have ever heard/seen..

The Servers are immature , they do not have proper proper knowledge of any of the cocktails served there, the orange banta RTD was missing in the beginning itself, Dum biryani did not tasted like biryani , rather it appeared like some home made rice with the 2nd round of tadka. Service was poorest , we had to wait for menu rather had to ask the waiter for waiting profusely for 7 odd minutes , the food came with no spoons , for every damn small thing we had to ask for it.

The amritsari Kulcha with chana does not do justice with the name. It's a standard stuffed Kulcha with ajwain (didn't have any butter on it) served with pindi chana that tasted just fine.
