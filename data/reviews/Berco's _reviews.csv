Yash,Rated Had got a delivery order yesterday and grossly unsatisfied with the experience. The delivery was super late but I could have excused that had the food been good. Hot and sour soup was like the chef had been given a full cargo full of soy sauce and he has put half of it in the soup - so much of it. Chicken kunchao is my favourite and I order it every time but yesterday it was very average in taste and very bad in serving size as the size of the portion was half of what is usually there - didn't expect such a bad thing ever. Now coming to main dish Chicken Kung Pao --- could not understand what it was --absolutely way different from Kung Pao -- tasting more like Hunan Chicken. Being a regular customer of Bercos especially this one it was shocking for me to receive such a meal. Had never thought would have to write such a thing for my favourite Chinese food joint !!!!!! HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED !!!!!,Rated 2.0,3,1,??

Shilpa Vohra,"Rated The mixed meat noodles remains my hot favorite at Berco's (Connaught place). I have been to this place quite a few times in the past few years and its quality has remained absolutely top-class. The chicken drumstick appetizer we had last week was one of the best I have had in recent times. If you savour chinese food, give this place a try. I know I am going back again :)",Rated 4.0,2,0,??
Abhirup,"Rated There's only one word to describe the feeling at a place like Berco's - EXQUISITE This was the my 1st visit here in all these years (my bad) & as an chinese cuisine lover, it is the obvious choice (thanks to my wife). Let's get to the FOOD. Loving it :) The menu has a wide range of choices. They have the cantonese, thai & a little bit of the indo-asian palates. The chilly chicken (cantonese style) was inexplicable good complimenting the equally good haka- noodles. The pint of beer just added the extra zing to the evening. Thumbs up for the chef and this place. Not so loving it :( The ambience was quite dull. May be they can just light up with some light music. MUST TRY for all food lovers.",Rated 4.0,6,7,??
Gaurav,Rated Food was average and the restaurant declined to honour citibank offer of 15% off on the bill value with the reason that bill is generated. We unnecessary had to pay extra money just because of this reason and non cooperation of the staff.,Rated 1.0,1,1,??

Mukuk,"Rated Today was my first visit to Thai Spice, but it definitely won't be my last. The food was flavorful, the service was very quick, and the prices were very reasonable. I overheard multiple people at other tables remark about how great many of their dishes are. I had the thai noodles, which was delicious. My only note is that it was pretty spicy, much more than I expected. My mouth was on fire - just from a noodle. I guess the name of the place should have been a clue, right? My friend had the Garlic Noodles, and she said it was excellent. That seemed to be a favourite amongst the other patrons, as well.",Rated 4.0,9,136,??

Kapil Goyala,"Rated A good pocket friendly chinese or thai restaurant in CP. We ordered crispy chili potato and a combo of thai redcurry with rice. Chili potato was good and curry rice were awesome. We ordered DARSAN as a dessert, which was more like Indian version of jalebi with vanilla ice cream but it was good. Mint Mojito were also good. It will be great if they can make the place a bit more with lights which can make the place more ambient. Thanks Kapil",Rated 3.5,6,1,??

Not even a single pocket friendly restaurant was available with the seats and we finally had to choose this one for our dinner.

Anil Thontepu,"Rated The perfect place for chinese and thai food. The chicken appetisers were quite tasty and in the vegetarian mushrooms looked over cooked but did satisfy the taste buds.

Abc098,"Rated The original icon of chinese (Indian Chinese) food in Delhi! When there was no one else, there was Berco's. And so fantastic! Some of the best chilli chicken and chilli prawns. Brilliant hakka noodles. Shouldn't have changed addresses though, the middle circle one is a bit difficult to find. And going the chain wasn't the smartest I reckon.

Akanksha Bisen,"Rated Thank you Mr Rawat, I'll keep coming there as long as they have you around!!! The humble server there, he made my evening. I went there to try out the crispy mayo prawn which I had been craving ever since I had restarted eating non veg. Finally, we went there, but I guess people have n't tried it or have stopped eating it for some reason. We placed an order as soon as we sat there. When it arrived, it was cold and i doubt stale. Disappointed, we ordered other stuffs like crispy chilli garlic fish and chef's special chicken noodle. Mr. Rawat saved it into turning it into a sad tale. Crispy chilli garlic fish is a must try. The chef's special was great. I hope they start serving fresh mayo prawns soon. The fruit beer is one thing I have whenever I am there FYI Berco's is one of my fav place to have Chinese",Rated 4.0,40,480,??

Olive,Rated I heard a lot about this place untill I experienced myself. Had a pathetic experience. Ambience is very poor not at all hygienic plates tables everything was dirty. Staff is not at all courteous and attentive. They should convert it to self service. Ordered Chilly Garlic Noodles found nothing exceptional it was avg in taste.

Surabhi.gupta.delhi,"Rated Went there alone, ambience was really nice. I went alone and waiter didn't even serve me water thinking someone else might join. I ordered crispy chilli potatoes and spring roll. Chilli potatoes were huge in quantity and yum as well. Spring rolls were average and quantity was also average. Like 2 rolls for 200 bucks? Ain't it too much?",Rated 3.5,14,18,??
Ishita Me,"Rated The place was not a very good experience. I had heard good of the place but I was kinda disappointed. I ordered Nasi Goreng, Salt and Pepper vegetables.... Average!!! The place was so hot in the mid of summer as the AC was not working. The music was idiotic and the waiters had no clues about the menu. They did not have prawns which was another disappointment. Would advise to confirm everything before you visit.",Rated 2.5,39,40,??
Raagini Bhalla,"Rated A reasonable treat for all Chinese lovers! The quality and taste of food really depends on the time you visit the restaurant. The taste and preparation isn't good at all during rush hours (lunch and dinner timings). However, when the restaurant is relatively empty, they serve you better quality food. Their Veg chilli garlic noodles are spicy and really good. Veg butter pepper noodles are a must try, it's slightly different than the usual noodles available elsewhere. They put in capsicum, onion and bell peppers which makes it look richer. Veg Singapore noodles are good too. Slightly on the sweeter side, they can be had alone, without any curry since they are a little saucy. Garlic and cheese wontons are not too good. They are just samosas with a cheese filling and are deep fried. The taste of Momos(both Veg and non veg) has gone down over the years. The quantity and serving style is the same though. Five spiced chicken (curry) is really good, a must try and chef's special as well. The chicken was really crispy, well cooked and gravy tasted well. It had Mushroom chunks as well. Quantity was more than enough for two people as it was accompanied by noodles and fairly priced. I've tried honey chilli potato a number of times, and the frequency of good servings is just 50%. Sometimes, it's good and of course very filling. It is sufficient for 2-3 people as it is very heavy. Sometimes, the potato is left uncooked, it is raw and hasn't been prepared well in the sauce. So, try your luck! Also, it costs over Rs. 300 inclusive of taxes which I feel is really high for chilli potatoes. The ambience is decent. However, it has a 'desi' feel to it over a Chinese restaurant. The prices are decent. The music they play is the same all the time. Despite of getting 'n' number of feedback forms filled, they don't implement the changes which are as basic as changing their music choice. Service is good. And you will mostly find a table whenever you visit the premises.",Rated 3.5,20,63,??
Aadil Thatai,Rated Been at this bercos 2 times. Never disappoints in taste. But last time the service was slow and the waiters were inattentive and but the taste of all the items were great. Crispy fish with home made sweet chilli was really nice and the thupka was as usual a thumbs up 3.5 only because of the slow service..,Rated 3.5,4,20,??
Rahul Dev,"Rated Very standard food, not like some high quality food. Lots Chinese and Thai restaurants are doing much much better job. Service is something that really need to be worked upon. Waiters and helpers are barely willing to approach to take order or any other query. Not blaming them, just that they were not happily doing their jobs (management should look into their problems) because I believe that if management is really looking into the matter the staff gives a fine response and is very much client/customer focused. Hot and Sour Soup(Chicken)- Ok Ok Fruit Beer- Ok Ok with lots and lots of ice. Crispy Garlic Chicken - As if a kid was applying the batter and frying it. So unevenly cooked, like I was standing some street stall. Button Mushrooms- again very rough, like least interested effort. Disappointed somehow, will refrain from visiting Berco's again. Sorry.",Rated 2.5,66,306,??
Aakriti Sinha,"Rated I went there today for lunch. It was 15 min waiting, after that we got space on first floor. Chicken pepper salt and pan friend noodles were awesome. I personally loved the crispy fried vegetables and chicken! Also, happy hours made us happier. And the cherry on the cake was the desert, brown zebra. Must try! I reduced 0.5 point just because staff were less and not listening at all.",Rated 4.5,29,21,??
Nikunj Gupta,"Rated You can reach here easily in CP. Just look for the G Block. For the starters, Honey Chilli Potatoes and Chicken Wonton are the perfect choice. For the main course we ordered Chilli garlic noodles, fried rice and chicken hongkong. Presentation was nice. The fun part was we asked them to give us chopsticks and then try to eat with chopsticks but nobody was able to master thy art. Later on after a few minutes of hard work we switched on to forks. This is one the budget friendly places in CP.",Rated 4.0,6,71,??

Nimisha Mehta,"Rated I love to come here often whenever I am on a shopping extravaganza with my lovely ladies, my mamma and my maasi. This place is quite sorted up with the ambience around. The Chinese food is spiced up like the way we love. The noodles and the Manchurian especially; momos are also very nice out here. And the waiters were as usual lazing around. Not once I have been served the dishes quickly but the taste is so nice over here that I let go these minimal shortcomings.",Rated 4.0,20,41,??
Yamini Bhargava,Rated I love this place for the wonton soup. I don't like the noodles here as they are a little bland. Rest in main course the oyster sauce is good. Overall the place is fine and can be visited if budget is of a concern and you want to have decent Chinese food,Rated 2.5,20,76,??

Mansi Kashyap,Rated i have always been a bercos lover...but most of the times I have visited Noida's one. I visited here first time with a friend. The food is really good. I totally love there honey chilli potatoes and fruit beer. But what happened that day made me reduce the rating from 4.5 to 4. Power went off 5 times within the span of an hour. And every time we had to wait for atleast 5 minutes. This was a real turn off. Service is not that good but food is delicious!,Rated 4.0,38,68,??
Bhupinder Singh,Rated Berco's is one of the old places of Delhi which are still great. The Chinese restaurant is great for people looking a good meal which is not super expensive. The ambience of this particular one in CP is not that great. It is optimized to seat max number of people. Though huge lines outside are still testament of restaurant's quality and people's trust in the establishment. Try out Chilly Garlic Fried Rice and one of their Soup options when you visit.,Rated 3.5,33,109,??

Dim lights slow music and yes humble staff service.. :) The chilly potatoe, veg manchurian are the ones tht are the to be orderd perfectly cooked with perfect taste..

Its a thumbs up for this place.. Must try :)",Rated 4.5,3,3,??
RishWish,"Rated The quality and taste of the food has remained almost consistent over the years. Don't order meals because they serve it with stale dishes. Chicken in black bean sauce is quite good. Asian stir fry greens was surprisingly good - surprising coz I was impressed by a vegetarian dish. Su mai chicken dumplings are yummy, so are the regular steamed momos. Chicken thukpa (pictured below) was pathetic, tasted like noodles mixed with leftover water and chicken. Honey chilli potato was okay. The last time I went there was a fight in the kitchen coz of which our main course was delayed - we left without eating. The manager was apologetic and gave us a 20% discount on starters we had.

Prateek Sharma,"Rated When it comes to Chinese, Bercos and Yo china tops the list of any regular Chinese lover. These are the 2 mainstream famous restaurants serving delicious Chinese food, the Indian way. I absolutely love the Indo- Chinese version of Chinese food and not the Authentic Chinese served by biggies like Mainland China. I have been to the outlets of Bercos in Janakpuri District Centre and CP. I never experiment with Chinese food although i have tried a host of items like Vegetables in black bean sauce, Szechaun sauce. I never liked these items, nor the soups. It's not that they weren't properly done but i just go with very limited items. I always have Hakkah or Chilli Garlic noodles with Veg Gravy Munchurian for the mains. For the starters, Honey Chilli Potatoes and Spring rolls are the pre-decided orders. @DESIHABSHI has not tried a lot of different Chinese items but would like to recommend FA YIAN, a restaurant in the same lane, opposite to Bercos for an amazing experience.

Gourmet Lady,"Rated I was at Berco's for family lunch this Saturday. The placed was packed and after a short wait time we got our table. The place has decent interiors and ambience, nothing fancy. I wanted to try something new and interesting however they didn't have their regular menu but a curated festival menu, which had very limited choice and seemed pricey. Coming to the food, in soup we ordered veg hot and sour, which was passable and chicken tom yum which was well prepared. For appetizer, we had crispy fried vegetables, which was the star in appetizers. In non veg, we had the quintessential chilli chicken dry and crisp chilli mayo prawns. The first item was good but the prawn was a big let down. For 550 INR I was not expecting shrimp sized prawn coated in thick rice batter which was very hard to chew. After the prawn fiasco, we were really hoping that the main course would live up to our expectations and thankfully it did... For the vegetarian lot, we had a vegetable fried rice and assorted vegetables in schewan sauce. The dish was nice but the rice was a little under cooked. On the other hand, the non vegetarians selection was satisfactory - Mongolian chicken with mixed meat fried rice was heaven with equal competition from prawns in red Thai curry with steamed rice. We also took rounds of fruit beer which were awesome! For 4K, Berco's is value for money and a good option for family get togther.",Rated 4.0,13,100,??
Himanshu Grover,Rated Check out the pics to find out who greeted me on my first visit to Bercos CP branch. It can be expensive but not hygienic. I wonder how would be their kitchen.

Rohan.6515,"Rated Berco's has been around for a long time now. The place is well known for the Chinese cuisine it serves and has a couple of outlets in the capital. This particular outlet is one of my favorites. Located in the middle circle in cp , this particular outlet serves better food than most of the other outlets I've been to. The ambience is soothing and the outlet's decor is nicely done up. They have 2 floors in the outlet. The second one being for the ones who want to have liquor along with their food. The staff is one of the biggest pros of this outlet as the people here are so warm and always carry a smile on their faces. The service is also usually quick! I've tried their Hakka noodles as well as Singapore style noodles. I love Hakka noodles as they are a little bland and I love them that way. The Singapore style noodles are a nice change and for those who do not like bland noodles , I'll recommend they have these. Their appetizers are pretty nice. I've tried their lotus stem honey chilli , crispy chilly potatoes , juicy chicken drumsticks and chicken wonton. I really enjoyed having each of them. If someone wants to try soups here , I'll recommend the wonton soup. That's my personal favorite here. I always have the fruit beer which is also very nice. I've had better at other places but it's definitely one of the nice ones. The Manchurian they serve is one of the best I've had. The prices are quite economical as well. When in cp and you can't decide where to go then just land up at berco's. You surely won't be disappointed.",Rated 4.0,66,546,??

Balvinder Kaur,Rated Bercos this name has been synonymous with good Chinese food til now. But I have been very disappointed with their service. I visited this particular outlet today and they were having a selective menu it being Christmas. I understand that a restaurant can do that to handle rush. Firstly no one came to take our orders for around ten minutes which I understand could be because of rush. But then when I ordered veg steamed dimsums for starters what I got shocked me. They had served stale cold momos which were no way closer to dimsums for which they were charging. On bringing this to the manager's notice he apologised and got it changed. Thought the main course will be better. But to my amazement they again served me cold fried rice and luke warm assorted vegetables in black bean sauce. Then I again complained and the manager just said that the food might have been sitting ready in the kitchen for some time as if it was my job to check in the kitchen. So overall a very bad experience. Will think many times before going again...Rahul Poddar,Rated 1.5,30,40,??

Parvinder Singh Kalsi,"Rated I was here with my friends for Dinner last Saturday. How to reach? If you commute by metro, get down at Rajeev Chowk and take the exit at Gate no 7 towards Baba Kharak Singh Marg. Take a right towards the outer block, walk 300m and there it is! For the starters we ordered the Chilli Garlic Crispy Vegetable and Vegetable Fried Wontons. I loved The Crispy Vegetables but found the Wontons to be devoid of any flavor. We also ordered their Signature Fruit Beer which tasted good! For the mains, I tried the Chilli Garlic Noodle accompanied with Assorted Vegetables in Garlic Sauce Followed by Garlic Steamed Rice and Vegetables in Black Pepper Sauce. All of these were delicious. The ambiance and interiors were soothing and welcoming. The staff was quick,courteous and even helped us with the chopsticks! Would I go back again? Yes, definitely!!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Since work is 5-7 minutes away and we were craving some good Thai / Chinese and we see our seniors at work order from here often, we decided to give Berco's a try. Berco's did not disappoint at all. The stand out dish was definitely the Chicken Red Curry! It's a must try!",Rated 4.5,3,302,??
Heena,Rated A place which offers a nice Chinese food. The only drawback is that it's in a lane inside. Generally people who know bercos would visit but the visibility factor for new comers is less unless the other places in the entire neighborhood is crowded which has a less ratio in cp. Food served here complete Chinese with a sweet ambience of dim lights.,Rated 3.5,23,38,??
Adhiratna Jha,"Rated Personally, Chinese food is my least favorite kind. I went here because my friends insisted and obviously because of the fame this place has. I was pretty amazed. Even though seating area is very limited, but everything gets fairly compensated by amazing food, and really courteous waiters. They are also really helpful in deciding what to order. I tried the dimsums, fried rice, and noodles. Everything had unique taste and was something which I barely find in other Chinese restaurants. Plus everything on menu is fairly priced as the portions of food we get is pretty good. Overall experience was really pleasant and would definitely visit again.",Rated 4.0,10,1,??

Ananta Roy,"Rated I had to try this restaurant given its immense popularity in Delhi NCR. I dropped in for a light meal with the main intention to try a soup meal. Zeroed in on the Veg. Thukpa and ordered. The place is located in the middle ring on one of the radial lines and Rajiv Chowk Gate no.7 is a safe bet if you are travelling by metro. The ambience is wonderful and the staff polite and courteous. I love places with hanging lamps and this place has them too. The order arrived within 7 minutes. It was visually appealing and I tasted the clear broth first. The broth was a bit spicy ,could have been milder given the vegetables topping it themselves have a lot of pepper in them. The noodles were very fresh, smooth and tasted wonderful. I would definitely try their noodles dishes sometime for sure. They were soft , not chewy and I could cut it even with the noodle spoon. The noodles in the soup mainly lent the wonderful taste to this soup. The broth could have been better. Recommended.",Rated 3.5,66,358,??

Dillikabhukkad,"Rated A good chinese restaurant within an ordinary pocket is few and far to comeby and that is where bercos steps in. A place which has acquired the laurels of many, a cross between chinese vans on streets and chinese restaurants in 5 star hotels, bercos really has made its name. My favourite dishes that I always order when having lunch are - 1) thai red curry - one of the classical thai dishes are always amazing when had here. Full of coconut and the rich savoury sweet smell that emanates. 2) honey chilli potato - we all know how it tastes but it tastes better than many places over here 3) chilly garlic butter noodles - a must must order for a person having food here When visiting bercos keep it simple with the dishes mentioned. When visiting the cp outlet, you will find the interiors are a little dull and old but the service will always be very cpurteous. Have been going for the past 3-4 years, the servers make you feel comfortable.

Amrita,"Rated I used to be a regular here until a year back as I was living close by then and I love chinese. Since then a lot has been added to the menu but I have almost tried everything here and I know my favourites. The ambience is alright, service is good. The cocktails used to be great in those days but I have noticed a fluctuation in their food and drink quality so I cant say about now.. First off starters, my favourite is corn pepper salt. they serve these crispy batter fried corn kernels delicately spiced with onions, garlic, salt and pepper in a rice crispy basket. Tangy button mushrooms,, i used to love them once but they are very unpredictable... they have ruined it on occasions... probably because the place is super crowded and understaffed. Main course favourites are kung pao chicken and hongkong chichen. Both the dishes are perfect for the indian chinese palate. Another unusually delicate dish is sliced chicken in creamy garlic sauce- it has a white creamy sauce with bits of crispy fried garlic- i love it. As for rice and noodles, the regular hakka veg noodles is my pick as I find everything else too strongly flavoured and oily. Or I'd go for steamed rice I think. I'm yet to try all the thai, malay and other dishes. but on occasion when I have tried them, they were very heavy with the bottled curry paste flavor. nothing original. I would not go anywhere near the chopsuey. It depends on your taste though. U could check it out if you wish to. Among the sweets, darsan is ok.. most other things are usually not available. I wish they were more consistent with the taste of their food and I wish they have got their old bar tender back ...........",Rated 3.5,19,24,??

Nikita,Rated this place is a disappointment. go there only in when you can't find any other eating option in cp (which can never happen) for someone who likes Chinese this place would not meet your standards. what surprise me though is this place is always crowded on weekends. I am guessing it is because all the other places are jam packed and people are not left with any option. in shory if you ask me..I would suggest you to buy food from a local Chinese van instead of visiting this place.,Rated 2.5,26,107,??

Amit Bhardwaj,"Rated It was mini get together and we were in search of places with good Chinese and booze around CP. fortunately or unfortunately we ended up being here. They have two floors, ground one being a family place which we kind of figured out after wasting 10-15 mins there. Waiters were scattered all around the place and were very less interested in handing over menu to us. Ambiance on ground floor was good though. Place was fairly crowded and well lit. Then we moved to first floor which was our type of Crowd. it's a bar setup with average lighting and ambiance. Service was on slower side but comparatively quicker than ground floor. We ordered Budweiser, corn masala and chilly garlic chicken. It took them 10-15 mins and taste was average though quantity was very good. I believe the place lacks lively music and promptness from waiters with a smile. Most of them were sloppy. Was an average experience but would visit again for more.

Sajeev Jayarajan,"Rated I had rated Bercos very highly in the past. The consistency of food however tends to fluctuate - For eg Thupka soup tends to vary from bland to spicy/salty, same is the case with fried dimsums. Another area which I would want to flag is the service - again it depends on the server - fluctuating from excellent to mediocre/indifferent. This time the mobile credit card machine was not working so the waitress requested me to go to the cash counter - when I reached it there was already a gentleman whose credit card was not going through... Soon we were joined by another person... All three of us waited for the machines to start working... Around this time a staff member who identified himself as Ashu came and started fiddling with the machines - he acted like he was doing us a favor - looked very harried... Ten minutes later the machine started working and the first person's card went through... Then instead of swiping my card Ashu swiped the other gentleman's card... After that Ashu cooly goes to a nearby table who were finishing their meal for swiping their card... At this time I pointed out that I had been waiting for 10 minutes - the waitress also tried saying something and this arrogant lout cuts her and asks me how will it matter if it takes another 2 minutes... This idiotic lunatic not only breaks the queue but then has the nerve to ask how will it matter... I raised my voice and gave him a piece of my mind - he took since it seemed like he was not carrying one of his own - either mind or brains! After the shouting when other patrons started turning around he hastily cleared my card.... This man does not listen to other employees, customers and is a senseless moron... A hiring defect but why thrust him on your customers...",Rated 2.5,13,15,??

Authentic Chinese yet maintains an Indianised element to please the locals. Do be careful about the appetizers and soups you order as they serve the food really quick. So, the main course comes along with the starters. They have a separate lounge. Berco's is the best in town if your taste buds are partial towards Chinese. Way better than the likes of China Garden,Taste of China and others as it is very pocket friendly considering the fact that it is located in CP and serves quality food.

Asha Jose,"Rated At age 14, I had my first real taste of Chinese foodand since then I was hooked!! Over the years, I have (gluttonously) tried dishes from the long-stretching spectrum of Chinese/Asian Food, starting at the far left side of the scale, with our desi Chinjabi/Chindian specialities like Crispy Chilly Potato, Chowmein ,Hot & Sour Soup, way till the right most end of the spectrum- that is, your authentic Chinese with Sticky rice and Cold noodles. And I must say, that I have loved both. Needless to say, Bercos has been synonymous with the Chinese Cuisine revolution in our country, by serving piping hot, tasty delights, prepared hygienically and served with a smile. This time around when I visited Bercos, it had been around 4 years. Thats quite a huge gap, I know. But somehow, nostalgia (and the warm, fuzzy feeling in your tummy, that can only be given by soup) got the better of me, a few days back and I decided to go to Bercos and see whats new! We reached at 9:30 pm on a Sunday evening and the place was packed. We had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table. Once inside, we ordered the Chicken Thukpa, Singapore Wok (Chicken), Steamed Rice with Shredded Lamb in Hot Garlic Sauce. The Thukpa was so deliciously balanced and comforting, that I immediately felt like I was enjoying this humble bowl of fuzzy warmth & goodness, on a chilly winter morning in Himachal! (Also, I might have had a tiny tear in the corner of my eye, because of the truckloads of happiness, this simple dish brought me) The Singapore Wok, was basically Chicken pieces, along with greens hand tossed in 7 different sauces. The taste was very different from anything I have had and I enjoyed it thoroughly (very oily though!) Shredded Lamb was easily a top-class gravy dish with beautiful shards of lamb, in a mouth-watering gravy. We ate to our hearts content and were very happy to pay the totally worth-it bill of Rs 1300!! On a ending noteI would just like to sayBURRPPP!",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Chitra Chirag Goel,"Rated I have been to this outlet a couple of times. The ambience is amazing and something that instantly relaxes you. The air conditioning is perfect; neither too hot nor too cool (which remains my concern in most of the places I visit and most fail to please me). Just love their chicken/veg Manchow and Hot & Sour soup. My favourite starters are Honey Chilly potato, crispy corn pepper, shitake mushrooms. The portion size is decent and crispy corns and mushrooms are must haves. In main course, their chicken and lamb never fails and exotic vegetables are delicious & the schezwan sauce is always spot on. The only concern are their singapore noodles which are a bit sweet in taste.",Rated 4.5,13,24,??

Spring rolls were actually a much fatter and oiler version of actual ones. Most disappointing my friend got food poisoning next day after eating them. I am not sure what quality of oil they use. Service is very slow. It took us about 3 hrs for lunch in afternoon so I can't say about dinner time. Drinks were usual. Manchurian was no good either.

Subhayan Chakraborty,"Rated Berco's was the first restaurant in CP that I went to. :D And it has been a fantastic experience. And that's partly because it's one of the most affordable places around, yet exudes the feel of quality dining. That you can gauge from the sheer number of reviews down below. The #AMBIANCE is carefully crafted along an oriental theme. The lighting is muted and the sino - japanese motifs adorning the wall along with bamboo partitions and Buddha images make it very believable. The tables at the far end is good for sitting as the calming instrumental music is most audible there. #SERVICE is quite nice, I'm led to believe but the waiters messed up 2 of the 3 items we ordered, bringing us the wrong dishes. #MENU is expansive. The only grouse I had with the #FOOD were the portions which were smallish and in effect just right for a single person. Other than that, it is not only well made, but stays true to the Thai or Chinese culinary tradition. We had ordered the in house speciality, the singapore style noodles, but were were brought the plain Hakka. Anyways, it was nicely balanced and the flavors seeped through. The best item was the stir fried asian greens. A perfect jumble of assorted broccoli, chinese cabbage, baby corn, zucchini and bok choy, it was a range of tastes. Tempering each was the light sauce with soya and fried garlics which gave enough space for each taste to seep through and at the same time created a sizzling yet raw taste, from the sauce and the vegetables respectively. Although we had ordered the Thai Tom Yum soup, we were provided the Tom Kha, an obvious serving mistake. But, the Tom Kha was excitingly different in itself and I liked it. The clear soup is tinged heavily with a sour coconut milk taste which forms the main flavor base. It had finely chopped pieces of baby corn, mushroom and various leaves I didn't recognize. It was quite heavy and I recommend 1 serving to be enough for two people #PRICING is pretty fair what with the nature and locality of the establishment but I was very upset over the #SERVICECHARGE they take, over and above the legal VAT and the Service Taxes. Remember that, although VAT and Service Tax are legal tax instruments, SERVICECHARGE basically means the restaurant is charging you for bringing the food to your table. And that is not only wrong but illegal. The upstairs is a dining cum lounge bar which strictly requires ID proof from patrons ordering alcohol.

The care with which this old man greets each new patron is bound to make you smile. :)",Rated 4.0,148,826,??

Much better than the Janakpuri/Noida outlets. The place is spacious and the staff's decent and the service is prompt. Coming down to the food, we ordered - Veg Spring Rolls which were amazing. One of the best spring rolls I've had in terms of being crisp, the flavour which was borderline spicy and the vegetables were cooked well. - The Butter Pepper Garlic noodles are awesome. Absolutely must try dish. Could be had stand alone/with Manchurian gravy. The noodles are cooked in a butter sauce and are slightly more crisp with garlic sauce providing the Chilly. Really good dish on the menu. - The honey Chilli Lotus stems are also very well done. Though, not an innovation, but it's a good twist to lotus stems and they have it made absolutely crispy and the sweetness and Chilli are blended really well. - The mint Mojito wasn't anything to rave about.

Rahul Gandhi,"Rated I have visited this place numerous times and with the word ""numerous"" it implies that i liked it a lot but it changed all of a sudden yesterday . The food served to us was nowhere upto Bercos quality and moreover when i complained there was no one to take care of it. Staff alongwith the cashier were least concerned about taking note of concern of a loyal customer. Order: Chilly Paneer Chilly Potatoes Crispy Chicken with garlic sauce Fruit Beer Fresh lime soda Crispy chicken was so crispy that it had a bitter taste and was uneatable. Chicken smelled like its been rotting for few days. When i complained about the bitter taste i was told that its ""crispy chicken"". Chilly Potatoes were more of a joke coz they tasted sweet rather than being chilly at all in nature. Chilli paneer was seriously uneatable. Cornflour on paneer was raw and it dint taste like chilly paneer at all. I dont know what's going on at Bercos but the standard of food has really gone down. Hope the management takes note of it and bring the legacy of ""Bercos"" back on silver platter.",Rated 1.0,7,13,??

Its just that you dont get the kind of taste you expect at the prices you dish out here. The food is decent but it fails to live up to your expectations. Their range is fine and there is a good amount of options on the menu. Its just that the items which I tried on my visit there did not go down too well with me. Or maybe I just arrived on a bad day.

Then, I was informed to choose two combo meals that they have on their menu, which is totally different from the groupon website. My net was not working, i asked them to check the website. After further 15 minutes the manager comes over and says ""I will get it done for you but, this not what we offer"". Excuse me! I am not eating that for free. I have paid for it after seeing and seen the website for the menu. I really felt like moving out. It was so RUDE. The only reason I am giving 3 points is because of the food.

The Hungry Young Man,"Rated Bercos has been around for some time in Delhi and has established itself firmly as the go to place for the 'Indian' Chinese lover. The decor and staff, as well as the service of this restaurant is up to the mark and swift. To double check on the 'Indian Chinese' taste that most of these commercial chinese eateries are famous for, I ordered a Tom Yam soup with prawns. The flavour was quite original and the prawns and herbs were done perfectly. For main course, I tried the Chilly Garlic rice with a chicken variety and I would say it was just okay. If you still want to taste specialty Chinese, I would rather not suggest Bercos.

Sharath Reddy Vennu,"Rated After watching a movie with my friends, we made a sudden plan of going to Berco's for lunch. I called them while I was in the metro to confirm if the restaurant was open at around 3:30 PM as we were late. The telephonic service was pretty good but I am afraid I cannot say the same of the service in the restaurant. It was a bit crowded when we reached and we had to wait for a while. It wasn't an issue but when we went in, they gave us a table which is for four people and we were six. After complaining, they gave another table which also accommodates four people but it was fine after putting extra chairs. Coming to the food, it was great. I have no complains with the quality and quantity of food. I would say great. We ordered Wonton Soup, Chilly Garlic Crispy Vegetable, Singapore Wok, Butter Pepper Garlic Noodles (Veg), Pan Fried Noodles (Chicken) and Minced Chicken Chilli Fried Rice. I loved the soup and Pan Fried Noodles. The rest were good too. Coming to the service, no one was serving the food to us even after asking them too. In fact, when a friend of mine stood up and asked them to please serve the food, one steward named Satish was kinda rude to him. He was saying that he is alone and we have to wait for two minutes. Before him, we have asked 5 other people to serve food and all of them said 'Yes, sir' and walked away. I costed Rs. 2,000 for six people.

The food we ordered was half cooked, the beer was flat and was served at room temperature (not even cold). The so called 'Chicken Tom Kha Soup' (Thai) was devoid of Galagal and Lemon Grass - two key ingredients of the original preparation. The waiters looked overburdened, stressed-out and their attitude was rude (they tried to prove us wrong by whipping the beer with a spoon to create foam and thus prove that it was not flat). We are giving 1.5 rating - 1 for the courteous and vibrant security uncle at the gate who ensured a quick check-in and 0.5 for the decent air-conditioning. Awful experience.

He then told me that I can order anything from the menu. If this was the thing then the waiter could have told me on the first place. Moving on , i ordered pretty woman for the beverages, crispy tangy mushrooms for starters. Silken tofu green and chili garlic noodles for main course. After placing the order, i saw about the other mocktail menu on table. I asked the waiter to change the order from pretty woman to very berry shake. He gave me a weird reply that no shakes are available. If no shakes are available then why are they displayed as special mocktail menu? Crispy tangy mushrooms were really tasty. Loved it.

Fruit beer was more of a cold drink with water, chilly pats.

It's quite popular so you often would have a waiting time and because it's so busy it's a relatively loud restaurant. They had a festival menu which they were running for the past week the last day being the 1st. I'm quite amazed at the fact that their food is no longer spicy and very tourist friendly! By that I mean, that I cannot handle spicy at all and everytime I visit India I have to specially order non spicy food and now the trend in Delhi seems to be of non spicy food.

This place is a cozy place and is set in a narrow hallway with a dimly lit decor giving you a very soothing experience the moment you step in. The food here is delicious and more than lived up to my expectation, the honey chilli potatoes, the dim sums and the corn fried rice were absolutely beautiful. Delicious to an extent that we kept eating even when we were full. Especially the corn fried rice, a chef's special dish was an absolute cracker of a dish. This place deserves all the hype and popularity. But having said all the good things, there are a few things id like to point out, like the dim sums served to us were cold which is not acceptable. But the good thing is that they changed it immediately. Also the wait staff needs to be more aware of the food on the menu and must be able to assist the customer while taking the order.

Chhavi,"Rated In case you are not aware, Berco's is definitely on the top list of Chinese restaurants for Delhiites! Even NRIs do not miss to make a visit if they are in Delhi for a day or more. It is an old restaurant which has maintained it's standard and quality even after moving from inner circle to a lane in outer circle. Order anything from their menu and you won't get disappointed. Be it crispy honey potatoes, honey chicken. Garlic chicken or fruit beer. They also have a lounge in first floor where they serve alcohol. Ambience is simple and good, table mats referring to Chinese horoscope, reading which helps to kill time while waiting for the yummy food.

Food-It was great we started with chicken thukpa followed by the bercos classics,i.e., spring role and honey chilli potato which were followed by fried rice and veg manchurian.

I wish the staff didn't talk SO loudly among themselves about their personal stuff. Big time mood killer. We ordered : 1. THUKPA If you haven't tried this Tibetan delicacy yet then you are really missing out on something amazing. A clear soup loaded with noodles and veggies and topped with ginger and garlic. I dont remember the last time I went to bercos and didn't order it. Must order! 2. SINGAPORE NOODLES They were nice but something was missing. I felt I was eating it at a much simpler place than berco's. Hands down their chilly garlic noodles are the best 3.SHREDDED POTATOES IN HOT GARLIC SAUCE Potatoes should have been crispier.

I have been to this place multiple number of times and always order my personal favourite; Assorted Vegetable in Hot Garlic Sauce with Chilly Garlic Noodles. This one time we tried the cheese wontons which were surprisingly good. The drinks are at best average and can be skipped. The order is swiftly served and the servers are courteous and have a fair amount of knowledge about the menu.

The service is exceptional, the servers are polite and make sure you get what you ask for. For instance, i got a cake for my friend from outside and asked them to bring it to the table after we're done with our meal. They did more than what was required of them. The cake was brought properly, in a plate, with candles and everything. Not like other places which just get the whole box to the table. So as i said, they made us feel at home literally! The ambiance is calming and the food is scrumptious. I love their dimsums, honey chilli potatoes, spring rolls, crispy fried vegetables, chilli garlic noodles and chilli chicken!

I never thot I wud write review someday too (bcoz of my not so good writing skills :P ). But recently I thot I shud give it a try and try to express my love for food :) Though I have been to 100s of places in the city & was very confused which place to review first , I chose bercos bcoz I visited this place 2 days back only and I have immense love for Chinese food :) :) :) This Thursday me and my 2 best friends decided to catch up and thot of chilling at a place where we can get some good drinks and food and have not to think much over what to order . So we decided to go to tried and tested bercos . The restaurant is located in the mid circle and is the only restaurant in that whole lane behind block A of CP . The restaurant has two sections ..one at the ground floor , basically for food and other one on second floor which is basically a bar ... though they wud serve u drinks and food at both the sections. The ground floor is comparatively more designed with green plants , lamps and glasses than the first floor which just has furniture , a TV and a bar section. We started our order with drinks with boys opting for their usual beers n I opted for a vodka shot and green valley cocktail later on. While the cocktail was very good to taste n was light n was perfect for girls , I felt the shot was very diluted as it dint gave any effect after taking it (or may b I have a good capacity ;) ). In the food we ordered ting ming mushroom which were amazing to taste and butter pepper garlic noodles which though were mentioned in Chinese section of menu but had taste of Thai noodles & was average as per me. Overall , it was a fine dining experience and has been a consistent one over last so many year I had been visiting here . One must try this outlet of bercos . :) PS - since I love Chinese food , if someone asks me about top 3 Chinese food restaurant in Delhi , bercos wud definitely figure in the list .

Ashmita Goel,"Rated The food is good but the service is a nightmare. Staff is totally untrained and it seems are fit to return to the jungle that they have come from. I order take away / delivery atleast once a week since with my office located right behind the outlet. Every time that I order they provide discount coupons alongwith a copy of the menu. But the coupons are of no use since the outlet does not wish to honor them when I try to use one of them. No only that when I spoke to the Manager (Jagdish, claiming to be the manager, not sure if is since he seriously lacked the capability) that why do you provide them if you do not want to honor them, he says that they are expired, when the same coupons were only delivered a week back with the previous order. So why do give them if they are expired?? No answer. When I press him further, he finally offers a discount as if he is giving me charity and trying to humiliate me. Such atrocious behavior from someone claiming to be from the hospitality industry is totally not expected. Nobody cares for a foolish discount of 10% or a free appetizer but the intention is to fool the customer. This is surely the last time that I will ever order from this restaurant and would advise others to stay away as well.",Rated 1.0,1,0,??
Rishabh Lal,"Rated Full Review Below TLDR Version: -Lemon Coriander Soup was amazing -Chicken Drumsticks was excellent and seasoned well and not oily -Veg Spring Roll was average -Mongolian Chicken was cooked well and accompanying red schezwan style sauce completed the dish -Chicken Hakka Noodles was average, low oil, less qty of chicken and egg -Chilli Garlic Noodles was very tasty but could be spectacular if more garlic flavor was present. Went to Bercos on a Monday night with a party of 6. Were seated immediately and pondered on what to order from the extensive menu. First we started off with a vegetarian lemon coriander soup which was just exquisite. Not too sour and not too overwhelming but a subtle balance of the flavors making a delightful soup for everyone to enjoy. We spilt the soup into 3x6 and still felt like we were drinking a proper serving of soup. The soup was also well balanced with vegetables and mushrooms and not just liquid, which was a plus. For starters we ordered the veg spring rolls and chicken drumsticks. There was nothing special about the veg spring rolls as I felt that the dough was a bit heavy instead of a light dough you would expect. The drumsticks were really something special. I urge each and every one of you to try this dish! I have had many Chinese style drumsticks but this time was just surreal. The chicken was not extensively deep fried and covered in spices but surprisingly well flavored and delectable. Definitely different from the usual Chicken Lollypop. For the main course we ordered cottage cheese (paneer) in a hot garlic sauce, Mongolian Chicken accompanied with chicken Hakka Noodles and Veg Chili Garlic Noodles. The Cottage Cheese dish was really soft and paired well with the hot garlic sauce which was not too oily or spicy. The Mongolian Chicken was also a delight as it was cooked well and in a delicious red schezwan sauce but not too spicy. The Chinese Hakka Noodles were slightly above average due to the fact it was not oily but was very hard to distinguish that it was in fact Chicken Hakka Noodles due to the fact that the chicken and egg was used quite sparingly. The Chilli Garlic Noodles were delightful but could be even more so if the garlic flavor could come out more by ""burning"" it. Good chili flavor though. The food was enough for 6 hungry people and the bill came to about 2750 which wasn't deep at all on the pocket. Although hygiene seemed excellent there was a blunder I noticed. A waiter dropped the cutlery drawer on the ground and instead of placing it in the dishwasher it was placed back in the cutlery drawer for further use. Other than that the waiters were quite good.",Rated 4.0,5,20,??

Surojit Sen,"Rated Went for a dinner with family on a Saturday evening. There was waiting outside, probably ~15 minutes, but that's acceptable. The guard who was taking names was excellent, did not seem like 15 minutes, fun to talk to. Anyway, let's not digress. We started with the conventional chicken sweet corn soup and Drumsticks, which were excellent. Jumping into the depths of the menu, we decided to try the Thai food in here. NOT AUTHENTIC. If you have had real Thai food, you wouldn't like the Thai curry. Coconut milk was overpowering every other flavor in the Curry, and it was too thick. The Pad Thai was great though. Otherwise, we had also ordered the Pan Fried Noodles, which was not great, but decent. I have had better authentic food in Side Wok, CP. Ended with the chocolate cake ice-cream for dessert, which was good. Coming to the service part, not good. A mark of good service is that inspite of heavy crowd, the glass should not remain empty for more than 5-10 minutes, which it was for much more than that in here. The service can be improved upon.",Rated 3.0,44,150,??

Dipayan Bhowmik,"Rated My wife and me went there to celebrate her birthday.Firstly we did not get a place of our choice to seat. Understandable and accepted. The table we were offered seemed like a place in some shabby tea stall. It did not have any tissues, the mats were torn, water took 10 minutes to arrive. Then when we asked for cold water, it took another 10 minutes. We ordered chilli garlic crispy fish and chicken salt n pepper. The taste was very bad when compared to their Janakpuri/Dwarka outlet. Then we ordered mojitos. It took another 20 mins to arrive. When we complained about their reluctance to provide service, a waiter came and literally threw a plate with three tissue paper. Then we ordered for chilli garlic crispy chicken. Again it took ages to arrive. I was at the threshold of walking away, but a lady came and apologised. We learnt that the waiter did not update kitchen about our order. I was overwhelmed at their unprofessional behaviour. Finally we ordered rice and noodles Shanghai style and five spice chicken. It was tasteless. We left almost half of them. Finally the torture came to an end and I had spend 2128 rupees for this experience. I would never step into that place and make sure that I save people whom I know from the torture by going there. Disappointed and disgusted we were heading towards Starbucks to refresh ourself, we overheard three girls who were having food at a table beside us. They were saying that the food and service was so bad that they had to leave almost half of what they ordered and the went because they were very hungry. But now they are dejected at their loss of money and appetite. While swapping my card for payment the lady did not plug the cable and swapped and said that we are not accepting card. When I told that the cable needs to be plugged she said 'I know'. Don't waste your time and money. Read this review and save yourself from Berco's,CP.",Rated 1.0,1,2,??
Ankit Mal,"Rated I have been to bercos several times before as it is located quite near to my office. Recently had dinner with my friends who wanted to eat Chinese and without any doubts I recommended them bercos. It has got really good ambience. The food here is delicious and hygienic. The rates are quite nominal as compare to other outlets offering Chinese. The service is good. We ordered honey chilli potatoes, spring rolls, dimsums and chilli garlic noodles, manchurian, phat Thai noodles and mocktails. I personally suggest to try phat Thai noodles, it's just amazing.",Rated 4.5,49,237,??
Rishab Mann,"Rated One of the landmarks of no-nonsense ""Chinjabi"" cuisine (although, as expected,the menu would have you believe they serve ""authentic Chinese delicacies""!). The service is quick without unnecessary frill and fancy. The menu is expansive. I have occasionally been adventurous (Chef Special Mustard Fish) but do suggest you stick to the usual to avoid any unexpected tingling to the taste buds. Crispy Chilli Lamb, Sliced Chicken in Oyster Sauce are two of the dependable dishes. The fruit beer has been a regular accompaniment for many decades at executive lunch tables and for obvious reason! For a medium price range and a quick tadka Chinese option, it ranks almost close to perfect. 4.5/5!",Rated 4.5,29,99,??

Lipika Sharma,"Rated Berco's located in Connaught Place offers one of the finest chinese food in the area. The moment you enter the restaurant, it's ambience will naturally absorb you in. Talking of the food offered here, the best bet is the Singapore noodles on their menu. It's flavours are simple, easy and smooth on the palate (It's sometimes good to avoid confusion in food). Chilli Paneer is one dish you'd never want to finish off your place. It leaves you wanting more. Another one highly recommended is their 'Dimsums-Momos'. They are served in a bamboo basket which retains it's authenticity and the flavour of the preparation. The momos are considerably good in size and filling. The presentation of food here includes adding various colors making it visually more attractive (and making you hungry). If you want some drink to go along with your food, you'd like to order a Fruit Beer. The setting of this Chinese restaurant exudes calmness and allows you to enjoy the food undisturbed (that's exactly how I like it). The fact that it's easy on your pocket and the items on the menu are decently priced comes as a bonus. So, this restaurant should be your choice when you want to enjoy some fine chinese food without burning a hole in your pocket.",Rated 4.0,1,10,??

The staff is also friendly and service is satisfactory. We orderedGarlic and cheese wontons. chilli paneer, chilli chicken dry and crispy chilli potatoes for starters. Chilli Potatoes were a little soggy. But the rest of the dishes were delightful. The cheese wontons are a must try, not dripping with oil with perfect flavours. And they serve the best Chilli chicken. Then we tried chilli garlic noodles for the main course with veg manchurian sauce. There is a reason they serve one of the best Chinese food and the reason is this. Noodles and manchurian are blended with good spices and flavours. Will love to visit again to try other dishes.

No match to the the sliced chicked in creamy garlic sauce for main course. Try it with rice and noodles Shnghau style. If love spicy then nothing beats Five Spice Chicken.

Shivani Sharma,"Rated Bercos CP was on my go-again list. I got a chance to visit it yesterday. It was my second visit to this restaurant. And the first visit was few years back. We chose to sit upstairs. As we entered, we're welcomed by a beautiful setting, a delightful placement of wall hanings and ceiling lamps. We're happy that we dropped in. We hadn't imagined that this would be the worst ever experience. The menu offers a wide variety in starters as well as main course. We placed the order within five minutes of entering the restaurant. We had to enquire several times about our order and we weren't served even after 40 minutes of placing the order. On asking again, the waiter who took our order denied that we didn't place one. What a pity that a famous restaurant like this offers such bad service. The waiters hardly smile, barely enthusiastic about their work. No one showed interest in serving us. Finally we called the manager who apologized for the inconvenience but then even he didn't show much interest. He asked if we want to cancel the order, instead of convincing us and making up. In the mean time the waiter served us one of the two dishes that we had ordered. But by then we had already made up our mind to leave the restaurant. I wish I could click the pictures of staff and posted here. It was the worst experience of my life. And the mood spoiler was not the food but the staff. Will never go to any of the Brecos. Very disappointed. One rating only for the ambience.",Rated 1.0,27,31,??

I have always loved berco's, loved their veg momos But now the story ain't same!! ?? I have been there last week and ordered ""veg momos"" and ""fruit beer"" they didn't steam it properly. They were so hard and weird in taste. I told them to stream them again. They took it and did microwave and got it back in two mins. The plate was so hot but momos were still the same ?? I somehow cobbled them. Then I revisited berco's two days back and ordered the same and I told them please steam it properly telling my previous experience but as they say history repeats itself ? momos were again not steamed properly and were not good in taste I felt like WHAT THE FFFFFFF and I dint say anything to them as I knew it's useless and I made my friend eat them all ??

Rajat Gupta,"Rated No matter how much I tell myself, I always end up at Bercos CP when it comes to Chinese cuisine. Maybe it's because of it's central location, or maybe becoz there isn't much competition around. I always try the momos (yet to find someone who makes them like they do), the soups and the crispy chilly potato. I recently also tried the Singapore noodles, garlic rice and veg Manchurian with a bunch of colleagues. The noodles and Manchurian was great, Garlic rice not so much. Their service during peak hours for non veg was a bit slow. The only disappointment is that they no longer serve the awesome chilli sauce with the momos.",Rated 4.0,17,3,??
Jagchintan Kalra,"Rated This was probably my 4th visit to this particular outlet. One thing has been common amongst all - SLOW SERVICE. However this time it was not slow service it was HOPELESS ULTRA SLOW SERVICE. To begin with got table in quick time. Waited for 10mins for water followed by another 10mins for the menu. I couldn't understand why the waiters were so occupied. Anyways our 1st order which eventually arrived after 20mins of ordering. Slow service is something which can still be ignored provided service attitude is worth waiting. We wanted to complain to the floor manager, to which he first ignored our message sent through one of the steward. We again asked one steward to ask the manager to come over. Surprisingly he arrogantly ignored murmured something and went downstairs. That was the point when we decided that its time to move out. We asked for bill for 2 starters which we had. Another aged waiter said when he saw us walking ""go, go it doesn't matter"" Wowowo ! They are actually right.. With endless queues they have turned blind and have forgotten basic customer service. What a disgrace ! We waited downstairs to pay the bill but before that wanted to speak to the arrogant,etiquette less manager and share our distress. After waiting for good 15mins we walked out without paying the bill which was actually the best part !

Sure one would love to go again.",Rated 5.0,5,55,??
Sushanta Sarkar,Rated The ambience was acceptable but the food wasn't. Ordered Singapore Wok which didn't have its ingredients in proper ratios giving the food a wierd taste.

Pragati Arora,"Rated The best chilly chicken I had there although chilly potatoes are also a must to try one but chilly chicken is my personal favorite here . Friendly and courteous staff adds stars to their badge but the only thing I hate about this place is the candescent and humid atmosphere there ( may be because it was winters when I visited , and the atmosphere was a product of humidifier ). The main factor I like their food is the EXACT QUANTITY OF SPICES AND SAUCES , that they put in , so that one can enjoy the taste and hotness of spices without burning their taste buds (that is really appreciating) Looking so forward to try other non - veg on their menu .",Rated 4.5,47,73,??
Harish Chawla,Rated When I feel like having Chinese I prefer to go to a tried and tested place that won't disappoint and will give me what I'm expecting. I've been going to this place for about 6-7 years and it has always been a great experience. Sometimes Parking is a little trouble but if you are lucky you can sometimes park really close by. But that cannot be a parameter for judgement as we know about the parking hassles the moment we enter CP. I like the ambiance of the place. The place has a warmth about itself which I like.

I would particularly like to recommend Crispy chilly lamb and Mongolian prawns. Lamb had me on its texture and it crumbled on my first bite. Mongolian prawns had a gooey texture and I could sense the prawn is mushy as it melted in my mouth. Dimsums could have been a bit better. I have had better chicken dimsums at non Chinese restaurants and Bercos while claiming to be chinese did disappoint me. Ambiance and Service were not adequate. At times we did feel neglected by the staff, when we had to call again and again to place our order. Bit more hospitality with keen attention to our order is advised for the hotel staff.

The restaurent has to two stories andd it was quite nice to see the plessing personality of the guard.

What coould have been better, Guys after standing in a que nobody likes to wait for their order for 40 min specially when you specialize in that food and some thing simple as won tons. The schezwan lamb nice curry nice lamb but may I suggest that you do not leave a lot of chillies into the dish and it makes the dish really hot and if possible please try to cut the lamb strips slightly thick because when the lamb is being sauted its cooking really fast and not absorbing the juices of the schezwan sauce. The pan fried noodles were tasty but again a small attention to details requested for less vegetables but again it had a lot of vegetables.And last but not the least Sir please serve a whiskey in a simple old fashion glass and not a tumbler sir black dog is a good whiskey please don't spoil the beauty by serving in a tumbler Wold certainly go back and look forward to having my whiskey in a tumbler",Rated 4.0,3,9,??
Shashank Chauhan,"Rated Went here for a family dinner. After waiting 45 minutes for the table ( tried reserving, but was told that the restaurant operates on first come first serve basis) we were finally guided to our seats. Feeling satisfied that our 45 gruelling minutes in peak Delhi heat didn't go waste, we ordered our food, crispy chilli potatoes, Singapore style noodles, hakka noodles with vegetable manchurian sauce, fruit beers and fresh lime soda. The first serving of beers, soda and potatoes arrived in 10 minutes with no trace of chilli or salt but with an unmissable overdose of honey, which for a spice lover like me was a total mood kill. Never thought a restaurant would try so desperately to make our experience an ultra sweet one. The fruit beers which i thought was there trademark was highly diluted and one could hardly get a taste of anything, but the fresh lime according to my mum was a way better deal. So i should thank them that atleast they got my mother's drink right on a mother's day :-P. Anyways, after finishing the entire plate within 10 minutes we waited painstakingly for 30 minutes for the rest of our order to arrive, which by the way for my hungry father seemed like an eternity. Just when his temper reached the saturation point the rest of our order arrived. The wait ended with a very dissappoiting spread. Singapore noodles were bland and manchurian had excessive salt as an icing on the cake. The only saving grace were hakka noodles which seemed like a treat sent from heaven when compared to the rest of the serving. To sum it up, this experience left a very bad taste in our mouths and would have to think at least twice before coming here again.",Rated 2.5,11,8,??

For dinner our order was Thai Red Chicken Curry and steamed rice. The curry was a perfect balance of spices and aromas.

Anshul Egbert Dass,"Rated Today I went to join my friends for a treat in CP. Everyone decided to go for chinese so what better place to go to than *Bercos*. I have been a huge fan of bercos for past 3 years. I have been to Noida, CP, Kamla Nagar,Kirti nagar branches of Bercos and the quality of the food has always been top notch. Today, I ordered my regular dish at bercos, *phat thai noodles*. I have been a great fan of phat thai noodles for almost 2 years now, but today I was disappointed and decided I will NEVER have phat thai noodles again. When the order came the Phat Thai Noodles smelled so bad as if the chicken was decayed or something. We all decided to complain as the dish smelled so pungent as if you were sitting next to a dumpster. The waiter came and told as that it is the smell of the *thai sauces* that was used in making the dish. When I complaint and emphasised that this was Not the first time I was having this dish then the manager was called. I complained to the manager and he simply told me that the recipe of the phat thai noodles have changed and all we can do is to order something else on the menu and ordered to get the dish removed from our table. This was heights!! I have never been so disappointed in Bercos before. Word of advice, If you are a phatt that noodles fan like me then please have a word with the waiter before ordering. Do ask what is there in the dish before you order and if it smells bad!! PS : PLEASE READ MY COMMENT BELOW TO KNOW WHY I RE-RATED BERCO'S FROM 2.5 TO 4.0",Rated 4.0,24,198,??

Staff seems disinterested in customers.,too noisy restaurant ...done one should do something about the doors that open onto the restaurant. Chilli chicken ordered was bland and had no semblance to a chilli chicken. In fact it did not have a piece of chilli in it...it was more of chicken manchurian.

And quality and quantity of their food is pretty decent and very well priced too. So it attracts a lot of college students & people from the offices around. On my last 3-4 visits i had to wait for 15-20 mins to have a table. But worth the wait since i enjoyed my meal. On every visit i ordered something different, and most of their items lived upto the expectation. From their soups to dimsums and heavier chicken and fish options, their preparation is good. P.s the Chinese they serve isn't authentic. Inclined more towards the Desi side with spicy garnish. But it's good nevertheless. Great value for money :)",Rated 3.5,41,292,??
The Foodie,"Rated Berco is a timeless classic. I went their with my brother who is settled in Singapore- the land of Chinese n Thai cuisine. He is always excited to eat Chinese the Indian way though with chopsticks. lol. We got seats as soon as we reached - thankfully. It was 4 pm and that's what I love about Delhi - unlike Bangalore and Mumbai it doesn't force the citizens to eat lunch by 3 pm. It lets the people relax and eat whenever they want to. Always wondered- how could anyone put a stomach on clocks? Back to the review- it was full. Dim ambience with low lighting. The rods by which the lamps were hanging had been covered in Christmas green ferns. ;). The servers took time to give us water but were quick with the menu. We ordered Kung Pao chicken- which was a disappointment. Why can't people do it right !!! We ordered green curry and got red curry instead. When asked to change it , the server replied- it tastes the same so would you still want to change it !!!!! lol. My brother looks at me and I insist to change it. The much awaited green curry was heavenly delightful. The experience was nice because of the food. The portions were good. They were out of chopsticks :).

Komal,Rated Bercos has its own place in the market. A very casual set up where you feel at ease and very reasonably priced. The second floor seating is very congested although the first floor is lot better. A few friends of mine are big fans of this place but honestly I don't like it very much but had gone there with them only. The staff is friendly & prompt. Ambiance could have been a lot better. Fruit beer is definitely good. But food is truly the Punjabi Chinese style. High on oil & spices. I guess Kitchen Staff should look into in order to retain old customers as there is a rising trend of Chinese Restaurants in the market.

Drinks are also usually good, I generally go during happy hours, when they have some special discounts on drinks. The best thing about Bercos is its value for money.

Navratna Ojha,"Rated Every time I visit Delhi, I make it a point to have a supper at Berco's simply because of the fact that they serve authentic Chinese cuisines along with drinks. My last visit came roughly some 4 months back but the experience is worth mentioning. I'm really a fan of the crispy tangy button mushroom, chilly paneer is something which i would always eat no matter what. Chilli lamb was a little disappointing but would say that the lamb standards are really set very high in Bangalore and so would pass it. Other chicken dishes to try for are Chicken Hongkong and Mongolian Chicken. The thing which i really don't like here is the constant poking of the waiters to give an order. Dear Management, If i have called-in to the restaurant and taking a little time that only means I couldn't decide what to eat. Please don't ruin the experience by sneaking in every two minutes.

At CP you have multiple options were you are served the Chinese food, however when we were told there is Berco's in CP there was no stopping. We searched for the location of Google map, trust me it was really difficult to locate the restaurant. So for the first time visitors, the cue is its behind the A block were UCB outlet is located.

We had five spice chicken which is like the chefs specialty, and trust me you will not be disappointed. The chicken is Crisp and the spices add the everlasting flavor. We had Chilli Garlic noodle and Butter pepper Garlic noodle which were also fantastic. Chicken Hongkong was a bit plain and lacked the texture. Overall it is a good place.

Its the time wen u wanna look for a place where u can sip in some soup . And thats wen u wanna explore pan asian cafe's . Berco's was always the place on the charts for us to visit , so we decided to have a leasure time there . The ambience seems to be definately a turn off to start with . For a table of two , we started off with the soup 1 by 2 , talumen . To my surprise , it was not at all talumen , but wen questioned they had it with a flaunt ""thats how we prepare it "" . Another turn off . To getting on to the appetizers , spring rolls for my veggie wife and chilli crispy lamb . For me it was definately a treat for my buds, but to see the spring rolls in a platter , it was aweful . I mean in the race of pan asian cafe's , u expect a good presentation along with a relishing taste , but it failed it components to the both. Now coming to the main course , shengai rice chowmien ,along with soya sauce dipped manchurian. Now thats wen we felt that as per the people's opinion this place does not even come in the rat race of the pan asian cafe's . The shengai rice chowmein was the only golden lining to my plate rest was not even tooth some wish . The customer service needs to be grilled on nd definately needs a good hand on . We had to call Mayank, the manager who was the only reason for us to feel a little on ground . Cuz we said the waiter for atleast 3 times, for the pan dates rolls with ice cream but i think that was not on the charts . I m just a little calm cuz my wallet had a smiley after we paid the bill , rest nothing that will make me feel to come here again . Over all a 2.5.!!!!!!!!! Cheers.",Rated 2.5,55,213,??

Unless and until you are in a big group, waiters don't really want to stress on working. It does have a nice ambience but is too noisy at times. Salt and pepper chicken is not what you would like to order Here. I would say go for their meal platter or combo, whatever they like to call it. A much better place to taste Chinese cuisine would be Crazy Noodles in gurgaon.",Rated 3.0,5,43,??

Rohini Gauba,"Rated People might have started disliking the food they offer after the advent of authentic Chinese restaurants but I would still continue going to Bercos, not just this outlet but a few more because eating out this place never seems to be heavy on my pocket. As far as the food is concerned, I prefer going for combos or bowl meals with a glass of coke. At Bercos, you get to choose your own sauce and vegetables for the bowl meals. But you still wouldn't get to have a Kimchi Salad in the meal. We even ordered Ting Ming Mushrooms, crispy fried mushrooms. I could only taste the batter and had to struggle to find mushrooms. Chopsuey is another personal favourite because of the amount and texture of sauce they give along. I am happy with the quantities of food served, not happy with the service though..had to constantly remind them of our order. Even on a Friday evening, most of the tables were vacant. We paid 1200 bucks for 3 people and came out with full bellies. Berco's is here to stay forever. Happy Eating!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

On my Nth visit probably here, the experience remained the same! Just that it is getting more and more crowded with every passing visit! Went for Chilli Garlic Crispy Chicken and Chicken Pepper Salt for starters. Good stuff. The Kung Pao Chicken is my all time fav and I recommend that to everyone I go with !!

Sanju Sharma,Rated i have lost count of my visits to Berco's. i have tried their so many outlets and the place never fails you. This particular outlet is located in middle circle near A block of CP and is always buzzing with people. it has two floors and the first floor is good for organizing a group meet or party. the place has a decent ambience and courteous staff and serves good thai and chinese food. i am a big fan of their five spice chicken and chicken kunchao. to go with your food order a fruit beer. must try: Five spice chicken,Rated 3.5,23,407,??
Gunjan Kalita,"Rated Berco's has always been a place close to my heart as it is one of the first restaurants that I visited after coming to Delhi. The first time I went, I just had their Singapore-style noodles, which was noodles tossed in schezwan sauce, but the taste clicked, and at that moment I knew I had found a place to be included on my 'revisit' list. Locating Berco's can be a problem only for people who are new to New Delhi and who are confused about the inner, middle and outer circle nuances of CP. I usually tell my friends to get into the middle circle and keep going until the REALLY BIG sign hovers before you. The ambiance of the place might not be 'posh'-y if you're someone who haunts the upscale restaurants around Connaught Place, but it definitely ain't bad. Buddhist statues, murals and paintings adorn the entire restaurant. The lighting is on the dimmer side and the restaurant itself is spacious. On our last visit, we ordered Chilly Mayo Crispy Prawns for starters, followed by American Chopsuey, a Chicken Pan-Fried Noodles, Tofu and Greens, and a Chicken Fried Rice. The portions at this place is really good. The Chilli Mayo Crispy Prawns has a very loyal following, and it didn't take us long to find out why. The prawns were amazing! Crispy and tasty, it got our spirits up. Both the American Chopsuey and the Pan-Fried Noodles were delicious. Serving a good pan-fried noodles is a difficult task in itself, and I have returned with a frown from most Pan-Asian restaurants, but these guys made it really well. I ain't a big fan of Tofu and Greens, but since my pal said that it was a bit on the blander side, so I have to go with her perspective on this one. The Chicken Fried Rice wasn't really anything 'special', but there's only so much you can do to this dish. Berco's is a restaurant frequented by students as it's a very pocket-friendly place, considering the fact that it's located in one of the most poshest parts of the city. The best place to go to if you're on a tight budget. Overall, amazing place! You've found another loyalist in me!",Rated 4.0,70,276,??

Sarthak Pandey,"Rated Bercos is a place for students. One doesn't need to have pockets full of money, and the quality is reasonably good. The place is a bit hidden between two back to back blocks. But still attracts a good amount of crowd, again, mostly students out on a date. Thai curry is worth trying, so are chilly garlic noodles.

Tom Kha Soup' as starters and 'Babycorn, Broccoli and Mushroom in Black Bean Sauce' and 'Steamed Rice' in Main course in the vegetarian. We loved the 'Ting Ming Mushrooms' and I would recommend it to everyone going to Berco's. Veg. Tom kha soup was okayish and Babycorn, Broccoli and Mushroom in Black Bean Sauce wasn't good. Loved - 1.

The butter pepper garlic noodles, drums of heaven, chicken in black pepper sauce and chilli garlic noodles are totally worth trying.

I ordered Singapore noodles and a combo meal (cottage cheese in hot garlic sauce, springs rolls and Hakka noodles). I didnt find their Singapore noodles really authentic and their hot garlic sauce was not that good as it lacked the tanginess which it should be having, so improvement is needed there. My overall experience was OK and the restaurant is not that expensive which is a plus point. Cant say whether Ill visit here again or not.",Rated 2.5,16,74,??

Have recommended so many friends to this place for the food. All praises being said, Berco's at CP can surely think of redoing their decor. The plastic plants, weird fish tanks and the dark and dingy atmosphere makes you pause at the entrance for a few seconds and wonder whether this is the famed Chinese restaurant itself. Value for money: errr, probably No. Its a tad bit over priced for what they physically offer. It has to undergo Careful appropriation of their prices depending on what segments of restaurant they're trying to fit in to.",Rated 4.5,10,230,??

The service is a bit slow though. We ordered honey chilli chicken, grilled fish in garlic sauce, veg spring rolls, veg momos and hot chocolate fudge. The chicken and fish were nicely done and were quite spicy. The vegetarian food we had ordered was a bit bland though. Hot chocolate fudge was also good not great though. They have an extensive drinks menu but the happy hours close at 8pm which is disappointing. Overall, good Chinese and Thai cuisine can be relished here.

I had American Choupsey too, it was good. The only thing I love about this place is its fruit beer. Rest, I think the food needs improvement. I don't think the food was worth my money.

Utkarsh Mishra,"Rated Fancy caught thy eye? As we went around the place looking for options which were comfortable and yet not as pricy, we stumbled into a lane with this place. Odd as it was, we half expected the place to be full as the place looked nicely done from the outside. Luckily, we were a big party and had no trouble getting a few tables. So it is 8 in the evening, and you are in CP, but you are not expecting most part of this place to be that empty. Wooden decor with oriental wall decor was quite the eye catcher. Orange was the colour of the night. And so we all stared at the menu looking for options that would be fulfilling. We ordered quite a many appetisers, of which the chicken in black bean was definitely good. But most appetisers had a generic sweetness to it. Why. Of the mains that were ordered, the singapore noodles were spicier as most mains like the chicken and even the fish had a generic indo chinese flavour to it. Even if the place did not flash 'get your oriental here!', I was left disappointed. I mean to say, I would have paid less than half the price for the same preparation at other places. So we asked for the bill. Surprisingly long time it took for the bill to arrive. As fate would have it, I had to go the washroom as I had quite some water. I glanced over the cash counter and saw the cashier happily gaming away. My god that was quite a level in Candy Crush! So we left satisfied, but I was not as happy. I was really far behind in Candy Crush. I should start off on the game soon.",Rated 3.0,71,368,??

Samrat Dahotre,"Rated Went to this place for lunch on a Sunday afternoon since most other places in CP had a rather long waiting. We had to wait for about 5 mins before being ushered to our table. We were a group of three with a vegetarian amongst us. Being a Thukpa fan (having developed a liking in Bhutan and McLeodganj, my benchmark for a good Thukpa is quite high), I ordered a Chicken Thukpa and my friends ordered the Coriander Mushroom and Coriander Chicken soups to begin with. The Chicken Thukpa, spicy red as it was, seemed quite far from what I expected. Apparently, Chicken pieces from another Chinese dish were forced into the broth with it's oil and spices seen floating around. Needless to say, the Thukpa was a mighty let down. Enter Coriander soup. My 'veggie' friend ordered a Veg-Mushroom Coriander Soup, the soup that eventually came neither had 'Mushrooms' nor 'Coriander'. When we asked the clueless waiter what soup was it, he said it was Manchow Soup!! Passing it off as a misunderstanding, we asked him to replace it with the soup we ordered. The non-plussed waiter took about 10 steps with the soup and returned to serve the very same soup to us!! Perplexed as we were, we asked what soup was it and he said it was 'Mushroom Coriander' soup!! Trying very hard not to spoil our mood, we asked him to take it back and specifically instructed him 'not to bring this same plate back to our table again'. So the soup was brought to us a third time which had Coriander (the Gods took mercy!) in it. Visibly pleased, my starving 'veggie' friend started with her soup. Almost mid-way she had a doubt and asked me to check it. To our horror we found chunks of CHICKEN IN THE 'VEG MUSHROOM CORIANDER SOUP'! Okay. So we are very reasonable people. Mistakes happen and people screw up. It's only human. But when you do go out to catch up with your friends over lunch, you want to give all your attention to your friends and not to the hotel staff to ensure the order is correct. That is supposed to be a given. However, when we asked the senior person who took our order, about the goof-up, his reply was a very arrogant ""I told him to get a Veg Mushroom Coriander Soup""; no regret, no apology. Saying this he walked of to attend to other supposedly important things. We then had to bring the issue up with the Managerial staff who placated us with a fresh order, which eventually WAS what we'd ordered initially. Besides the quality of food served, which wasn't something I'd rave about, the service and experience at Berco' made our supposedly 'fun-filled afternoon' an ordeal (I don't think my fianc's best friend is going to have very pleasant memories of me). So there's no more Berco's for me. And for the benefit of other customers, I really do hope their staff learn the basic tenets of hospitality; politeness and courtesy.",Rated 1.5,6,51,??

Me and my friend weren't too hungry so thought of trying their chop suey along with a drink. Ordered a mocktail named ""sweet memories"". But this drink totally ruined my sweet memories of berco's. Seemed like the bar tender used a lot of grenadine syrup as it appeared deep pink and gave a look of roohafza milk shake :/ Also, one of the sour juices was added in adequate amount giving the drink a pinchy sour taste. Then arrived the curiously awaited dish - Chou Sey. The quantity served was good. However, Berco's seemed to lose the taste of their flavour in food.

Preetesh Saha,"Rated A busy Saturday afternoon, I along with another friend owing to our craving for some spicy Chinese food headed to Berco's CP (almost difficult to locate). Dimly lit, wooden floored and jam-packed at 3:30 in the afternoon. We barely managed to get us a table right at the far end (spacious restaurant). We ordered chicken kun-chao (appetizer), shredded lamb in hot garlic sauce and mix meat fried rice. (A friend had suggested to order dishes with those marked 'chef's special' on the menu, so we did.) Chicken kun-chao - fabulous dish, the right amount of sauces, spicy and tasty. Shredded lamb in hot garlic sauce - this dish was unreal(the garnishing makes your mouth water), well cooked and generous amount for 2. Mix meat fried rice - Fried rice with chopped chikken, prawn, paneer and other veggies, did not disappoint at all. All in all the food was well.... LIP-SMACKING. (Or maybe we were damn hungry, either ways, totally satisfied with food) What really fell flat was their SERVICE. Not that the restaurant had less waiters, they seemed too pre-occupied. We asked for salt and pepper and assorted sauces 3 times.. Only when we were about to finish our meal did they bring 'em.If you have arrangements for a big restaurant,you need to have adequate staff to run it too. Experience wasn't as bad as people may suggest.I would definitely recommend others to come try some chef's special dishes here, till the time Berco's management wakes up and decides to do something with their SERVICE.",Rated 3.5,7,149,??

Few suits (bercos staff) can be seen behind him. First floor is the lounge bar. Sitting upstairs won't be comfortable thanks to furniture. A bit loud music for the area and theme they try to develop. Overall ambience is not worth a great or ok type experience. For the same price there are better lounge bar near by. We moved to ground floor with in 10 mins. Till then no staff came and ask for anything. Then come the ground floor restro, sitting more comfortable. Buddhist painting stuff on wall. Ambience ok type. Loads of family crowd (specially Punjabi) and couples or group of friends hanging out. Service is ok. Food is ok. Suits are not aware of common sauces so they might try to improvise by suggesting something fancy. (Which I m sure don't exist , so if you ask them to bring that suggest sauce, they will say they have to prepare them ;)). Ample food per serving. But they serve cold. Order took 25 mins. Cold food serving is a repeat issue (been there 4/5 times in last few months) Request to warm food will take another 10 mins. When asked about feedback form, suit will get cautious. Try to be over dress or smartly dress ( more than jeans and t shirt or have a super fat visible weight issue) to get attention or good service from the suits. The only time the suit came and talk to us when he realized that my credit card was a super premium category. Before that he was least concerned about asking or offering us any dessert Or anything. Surprisingly, mouth shut have given them some certificate which seems unrealistic with the kind of place and ambience and food quality. Cutlery have visible scratch marks. Over all ok place.

Presentation- who cares, right Taste- average Quality- just edible After a really tiring day, we decided to have lunch here. We ordered Chilli Cheese Wantons- Pathethic taste. The cheese inside was sweet, surprisingly. The wanton crust is only edible. Crispy Mutton- It tastes just fine. It was a little soggy. Khaosuey- This thai dish was the only saviour and probably relieved my hunger pangs. The coconut flavoured gravy, cooked to perfection is a must try. Salt and Pepper Prawns- Bland. And then they were not fresh. the prawns were just deep fried with a bland blatter and served with some garnishing. I had to force it down my throat to pacify my craving for prawns. Chilli Potato- The Indian version of Chilli Potatoes which you ll probably find in every small roadside joint in Delhi. Please do not waste your money on this. Hakka Noodles and Kung Pao chicken- The only thing I liked was the Hakka Noodles, only because it tasted like the one I get in my neighborhood market. Kung Pao Chicken was bad. Chicken was bland and undercooked. The gravy tasted funny. The taste of fried peanuts was overpowering the dish. To add on to our miseries, my friend found a hair in the Kungpao Chicken which was the icing on the cake. To compensate, they gave us a complimentary death by chocolate, but the damage was done. Also, we were seated in the lounge area of Bercos on the first floor, they kept spraying very strong room freshener every now and then which just spoilt our appetite further.

One of my most favourite places in terms of the ambience it offers..right amount of darkness n light! ;-) The place is never over crowded(atleast wenever iv been there) but always full. Now i dont know how authentic the chinese is but it always successfully manages to satisfy my chinese cravings and tentalizing taste buds! This time I was here, we ordered a meal combo having hot n sour cottage cheese n noodles. A regular dish cooked well. But a strange spring roll kinda accompaniment which was served was all ice cold n tasteless. :-/ One pleasant suprise came in the form of crispy lotus stem! Almost a chilly potato look alike, this dish is super crisp n yumm..and sesame jus adds on to the look n taste! As a new addition to the menu, we ordered cheese n garlic wontons. Now wontons are small fried samosa kinda thing and this one was filled with garlic tinted cheese ONLY. Too much cheese for me. Served with a sweet chilly sauce, it was okayish but worth a try if u are in for a burst of cheese in every bite! Ting Ming mushrooms! Superb! Being a die hard fan of mushrooms, this dish was jusy my kinda thing. Crispy fried mushrooms in chilly soya sauce! Great! The service is okay and the waiters would be most prompt while collecting the bill after payment rather while serving.

Ambiance is really good and so is the quantity of food that they serve here. However, my experince(not once, not twice but thrice) hasnt been all that great. And my third visit here was probably my last visit too. The reason being that-1) the waiter was so damn busy that it took him 15 minutes to come 2) we had to ask for water thrice 3) during our main course, we ordered 2 sauces and noodles, we got our 1st sauce with the noodles, and our second sauce didnt arrive for around 10 minutes.hence we had to call the waiter and tell him about the same. When we got our second sauce/gravy, our noodles were absolutely cold. What a disaster. Hence, the food isnt really the problem but their service which lets it down completely and i was super disappointed. Comming to the food, well this too didnt really surprise me as i had expected it to be. Please do not try their chilly potatoes. They are wayy too crispy(probably becuase of way too much cornflour) and the flavour is not appetising. Their spring rolls, chilly chicken, dim sums, sui mai,soups are rather good. I genrally prefer to take a meal combo which serves the purpose really well.

The chowmein is very indian and just the way we love our indian chinese to be. The chopsuey has excellent flavours and the sweet and sour vegetables with fried rice is a wonderful combo. Berco's is still the same and I think that is the problem. Things have to change with time.

Neelav Samrat De,"Rated The oldest and first of the Berco's outlets in Delhi, this place was one of the best Chinese restaurants in town. Coupled with the food popularity, the restaurant also had a liquor license which made the visits all the more exciting for the elders, who would enjoy their drinks along with dry chilli chicken, pork fry and other starters. All this in the 90's when we were in college. Many years later, when we go there now as the elders, we have unknowingly followed suit to the previous generation! Berco's has always been a part of Delhi's food relics, and have stayed on in the market through thick and thin. obviously, it's now on an expansion drive, and thus I see a change in their food probably because of the arrival of the new chefs. About their food, I have always liked the usual sweet corn chicken soup, the kimchi salad. Their fried rice mixed used to be made so very authentic and went excellent with the pork and mushroom, black bean paste chicken sauted, and so many goodies. Their original essence has gone with time and it's more of a colloquial affair like most other Chinese restaurants nowadays like Mainland China also.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The Singapore Style Noodles is spicy and leaves a good impression. The Pan Fried noodles could have been and I have tasted better Pan Fried than this.

Aamir Ahmed,"Rated The thing about Oriental Cuisine is that it's available everywhere. You can eat ""Chau meen"" at the stall right outside your office, or maybe you could order some ""haaka nudals"" from the home delivery restaurant right outside your colony. But there are only a few places who know what they're doing, when it comes to serving Oriental Cuisine. BERCO'S, CP, is a winner. It's a highly popular place, with a usually large waiting line. It is highly recommended that you make reservations prior to your visit. The place has a nice ambience. It has fish tanks, bamboo shoots and enough laughing buddhas to make you aware that you're sitting in an Asian Restaurant. The food here is much tasty than a lot of indianized chinese food out there in the market. Here are some of the UPs and DOWNs about this place. UPs: 1. Location: Situated in Connaught Place, the heart of the city, makes Berco's one of the most easily approachable restaurants in the city. It can be accessed easily by road, and is well connected via the Delhi Metro. The restaurant is located in an Alley, slightly away from the other shops. The walk from CP's A block to the restaurant gives it a very Chinatown-ey feel, which I think only adds to the experience. 2. The taste: The food here is tasty. Since Authentic Chinese food doesn't really appeal to the Indian Pallete, they've tried to stick as close to their roots as they could. The food tastes different from the""Chainess food"" we've been having everywhere in the city, but in a good manner. 3. Value for Money: The food is very competitively priced. Taking into account the ambience, and the location of the place, the food seems fairly priced. And since the food is absolutely fantastic to taste, one doesn't mind paying that much. DOWNs: 1. Crowd: This place is always crowded. While this adds to the credibility of the place, it means that people are going to be around you all the time. There'll always be someone staring at you while you try to have a spoonful of your soup in peace. 2. Service: The service sometimes gets affected when the restaurant is running at its full capacity. It's upto you whether you count that as a negative or not. THINGS TO TRY: Chicken Hong Kong StyleChilli Chicken (Dry)Rice & Noodles Shanghai Style VERDICT: BERCO'S is one of the better places in the city if you want a taste of the Orient, without having to burn a hole in your pocket.",Rated 3.5,15,232,??

Sushant Arora,"Rated One of the most popular place for chinese and thai food, Berco's deserves a visit for its good food. During Sunday evening, there was a waiting and it took around 30 minutes to get a seat. We ordered red thai curry veg with noodles and non veg red curry with rice. We also wished for tofu and a mocktail but both were not available. The food took 15-20 mins to arrive but taste was worth a praise. The curry both veg and non-veg was authentic and tasted yummy with both rice and noodles. So, the food is totally best thing there. Chicken pieces were in the curry were soft and tender. Vegetables were also of the nice quality. Ambiance also gives an oriental type of feel with the lights, music and tables. Talking of the service, it was bit disappointing. Though attendants were decent, but they were confused on which curry was veg and which was not. Also, no napkins were provided on our table unlike other tables. Time between taking order and serving food can also be shortened. Overall, if these mini service related things are improved, the place will definitely rock !",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Ritudhwaj Singh,"Rated A group of 7 Friends Saturday night For Berco's staff: Invoice # EOO3811 dt, 5/7/2014 I am starting to think if I should make a choice of going to Berco's in Connaught place again or not. Reasons sighted below: I have been a great lover of food at various outlets at Berco's in NCR, be it Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad or even Delhi. Mainly for the quality of food they have and the service they offer. So, I did suggest my friends to have Chinese on this evening and since the place was not that far away from where we were, we ended up going there. We ordered our favourite Honey Chilly Potato as starters and it was not up to the mark. It smelled like it was a bit burnt and was not served hot. In main course we ordered for Creamy Garlic vegetables, veg Manchurian, veg lemon chilli, Fried rice, hakka noodles. The best of our main course ended up to be Creamy garlic vegetables which was well prepared. The most disappointing was the veg lemon chilli and there was just too much of chilli and lemon in the preparation. The quantity was ok (as per the Berco's standard). However the service was really not up to the mark on various counts. The waiters were no where seen to fill the glasses of water. There was no one to serve the food to us. And no one really was in a mood to even ask how the preparations were. When we gave a feedback on the quality of food not being up to the mark, the staff completely ignored it. Then it came time to pay the bill and it was not handled properly. Since we had complained already about the food, the waiter did not even bother to ask us our mode of payment - when we offered the Citibank card, they plainly refused to offer the discount of 15% and instead showed us a Citibank letter that stated a list of rules. We then called for the manager & Ravikesh Singh (8447748641) finally (after trying to avoid us), came to the scene. We told him all what happened. But to our utter surprise, he did NOTHING. My dissatisfaction mostly lies with the way this was all handled with the staff and the poor response provided. A word of apology from the Manager (about the mistake mae by his staff), may just have gone a long way to make the experience a lot better. All in all - pretty disappointing to find such instances were a few staff people become the reason for customers to think it Berco's is worth the time spent. Contact # 9650253111",Rated 2.0,22,48,??

Nakul Arora,Rated Went there last week had to wait for 15 mins as it was crowded and the time was about 10.45. Wanted to have a quick Chinese dinner(my gf is a mad for Chinese :D) so after a long time visited this outlet and let me tell you it was not at all up to the mark. No server there for 10 mins after being repeatedly telling them an old waiter walks up and takes the order(read as if he was doing a favor by serving me food) so we straight ordered main course chili garlic noodles and chili chicken with fresh lime sodas(their fresh-limes are pretty good).Meanwhile i asked the waiter if i could get a drink to which he said the bar is closed as it was 11 though i did try to see if they can sneak me drink or two. Then this old waiter suddenly tells me in a sarcastic way sir zen chale jaiye agar beer peeni hai to and i was baffled to which i said dude i got it that the bar is closed if i had to go to zen why would i even care coming here and i wasn't forcing him either.Anyways next the food arrives and the quantity was pretty good. the noodles were done up well but the chili chicken again had tooo much salt.

Singapore noodles was rich in flavor and good to taste. The other two dishes were not bad but nothing too great either. Ambiance was nice and it's a decent place to hang out with friends and have a family dinner as well. Cost is something which makes the place so famous I guess.

Joyee Biswas,"Rated Went there last night after a long time. Found it packed as usual (even though we had reached by 8:00 PM). We did manage to get a place on the lounge floor. It was good to see that they had maintained the quality & quantity of the food without jacking up the prices. The food as usual was lip-smacking. One thing that put me off was the long time it took for the food to arrive (even though we had only ordered Crispy Chilly Potatoes & Chilli Garlic Fried Rice - nothing exotic) although the cocktails were arriving quickly. The music system also seemed to be malfunctioning & the music was playing intermittently. All in all if you want to have reasonably priced, lip-smacking Chinese & Thai food this is the place to be (as evinced by the long line of people waiting for a table even at 10:00 clock in the night), the long wait for the food to arrive was, however, a put off.",Rated 3.5,3,8,??

Akshat Aggarwal,"Rated Bercos is well known for its chinese cuisine & I won't differ from the general opinion. Honey chilli potatoes & chicken drumsticks are among the scrumptious starters it serves. Main course dishes like Chilli garlic noodles, manchurian, Chicken Ranshanghai are few of the best in town. Their signature drink - Fruit Beer is just an icing on the cake. Anything less than 4/5 would not justify the rating. With decent interiors & aroma of chinese delicacies made me feel all the more hungry. Its just right to rate them 4/5 for ambiance. The only disappointment was the behaviour of the staff. They were a kind of adamant in their dealing. Which really put us off was when we ordered for the drinks they didn't have much choice to offer despite being mentioned on the menu. All the more, few dishes were also not available which were there on the menu. I would rate 2.5/5 for quality of service.

Ayushi Aggarwal,"Rated Both the Honey Chicken Chicken and the Chilli Potatoes were delicious - well-flavored and crispy. We ordered seconds of the latter! The soup, however, was a huge let-down. The Hot and Sour Soup was absolutely abysmal - ironically too sweet with soggy vegetables and the broth seemed to me like soya sauce in appearance- not a very appetizing sight. The Manchow Soup was passable, mostly okay. Death by chocolate and Brown Zebra were the saving grace, both amazing - the chocolate melts in your mouth and the ice-cream compliments it just right. By and far, Berco's isn't the best Chinese I've had. Don't get me wrong, though. Berco's has merit to its name. Additionally, considering that we didn't leave room for any of the main dishes, I cannot pass it off as a bad place to visit when you get a hankering for good chinese. The ambience is pleasing. We did find the service somewhat lacking - delays in orders, too many repetitions and mistakes in taking the order. Overall, it was a good experience. I think I shall visit this place again, eager to let them change my mind. :)",Rated 4.0,36,137,??

Kanupriya Singh,"Rated I found myself disappointed by Berco's, but that might well be because I went in with high expectations. We ordered Lemon Coriander and Chicken Manchow soups, both of which tasted pretty good. But the experience for me went downwards from here on. For starters we had Szechwan Dimsums (veg) - which were strictly average. For the main course we had a meal of veg Fried Rice, Mix Veg in Hot Garlic Sauce and (complimentary) Spring Rolls, out of which only the Veg in hot garlic sauce was the saving grace. I would rate it 2.5/5 on food. The service though was fast and the staff courteous and well mannered. So that's a plus point. 4/5 here. It being a weekend and lunch time, the place was pretty packed. So I would suggest that you make reservations in advance if possible.",Rated 3.0,60,139,??
Niya Grover,"Rated Well here I am back (on writing reviews). A night out with friends made me explore quite a series of places :) The first being Bercos. My love for the Chinese food makes me fall in love with this place time and again. Ample parking space available (we visited after 10:30 PM ;) ). Waiting time None. We went on a weekday and at around 10:30PM, hence not much of a crowd. Seating Decent, Though we explored that the couches which are connected together, shake when you hit slightly with your back ;) My friends kids explored this :P Ambience Decent. Though the hunger made every single effort that we dont really put much attention on the ambience. I loved the BUDDHA at the entrance of the restaurant :) Service - Excellent. But please make a note the kitchen closes by 11:30 PM, hence order your stuff well in advance. Pricing - INR 694 (Including 15% off on Citibank debit card) for soups(one by two) and appetizers for four. Food - We ordered sweet corn soup and hot and sour soup. I tell you the yummiest sweet corn soup I ever had; full of veggies (my taste for a soup) :) I just loved it! Hot and sour soup was equally good, though my personal take would be sweet corn soup anytime. Then we had crispy honey chilly potato and chilli paneer (without gravy). My mouth is still watering when I think about chilli paneer served at Bercos. Superb preparation I would say! Simply yumm. Decent quantity. Crispy honey chilli potato was also amazing. The quantity was too good! All in all an awesome place and easy on pocket too!

Curries flowing over the bowl .. Seeping down the sides of the bowl... Anyways so it was time for the much hyped food... Appetizers were good ... Ting Ming mushrooms and crispy chilly vegetables... Pretty good Main course not so much though... Tofu and greens and Chinese choupsey both were disappointing Tofu was just ""cottage cheese and the gravy was bland... The choupsey was hard and too thick to eat nd topped up with steamed veges which by looks said that it wasn't worth trying.... So we left the main course and decided to have another appetizer the cheese wanting which were not bad at all... All in all I might revisit the place but I'm so not ordering main course...

Ankush Mohanty,"Rated Abysmal. It takes immense hard work to build up a reputation however callousness to ruin it. Before Thursday, I would have vouched for Bercos in Delhi but the experience at their CP outlet shook my belief to the core. My experience ranged from being served raw food to a lackadaisical approach of the manager (more on this later, first the quality of the food). We had to wait for our table for about 30 minutes or so which I felt was a good think considering the fact that so many new restaurants have come up serving Chinese cuisine in CP, felt like that Bercos has held its own. The place was packed when we finally entered. The waiter suggested us that we shouldnt go for the Crispy Mayo Prawns since the size of the prawns used for this dish is small and not worth the money. We were happy that customer satisfaction for them came first as compared to just serving anything on the table. We went for Prawns Salt n Pepper, I wish we would have ordered nothing and would have left but nonetheless, people rarely appreciate the omens that present themselves in front of us (long waiting line..) The prawns that came were surprisingly big in size. Biting into them we realized that the prawns were small but the coating on them was made thick to appear as if they were the size of jumbo variety. And as you have probably guessed, the coating being so thick was obviously raw in the center and had a lingering after taste which made our mouths dry. Even before we could re-send it to the kitchens, the waiter was onto our table with the main course American Chicken Choupsuey, Five Spice Chicken (their specialty) and Butter Pepper Noodles. The Choupsuey was a gooey mess topped with a thick half fried egg. The photo attached will show you that we could only manage a bite per person and the dish had to be left alone. Next in the line of fire was the Butter Pepper Noodles. They were so salty that you felt that you just have consumed sea water. I am presuming that the salt content of the butter was not taken into account while preparing the dish and resultant was a pathetic show of cookery. The only saving grace was the Five Spice chicken which in its sweet/sour taste ruled the table although it didnt have any worthy competition. They have used different spices such as Fennel, Aniseed and Cinnamon to perfection to give you a sublime combination of sweetness with spiciness. Then at the end during the time of billing came the point which stamped Bercos pitiable condition. After giving our card for the payment, we had to wait for a good 10 minutes before the manager came back with it for the signature. It was someone elses card and bill. No problem with that (Genuine Error!) Then the waiter comes up and says, Sir it is yours only, please check again. The confidence with which he said that made us feel are we really someone else. When confronted with the manager, we were made aware that our card was misplaced and sent to some other table and it would be brought back in a jiffy. And their jiffy turned out to be another grueling 10 minutes and when we got our card back; the manager was nonchalant about his reply - Card hee to hai..! Precisely, Restaurant hee to hai was our thoughts and vouched never to come again at this particular outlet of Bercos.",Rated 1.0,103,370,??

When we came inside, it was already crowded considering the space of the restaurant, thus attesting Bercos is popular. FOOD: The cuisine basically compromises of Chinese and Thai. Best place for Chinese and Thai restaurant in CP! So we ordered: Singapore style noodles (chicken with egg), chilly chicken, chicken basil rice. 1) Singapore style noodles (chicken with egg): the noodles were perfectly cooked to the point. They were not over-cooked. It blended well with the cabbage salad, chicken and egg. I felt it was a truly complete meal and surely a must try! 2) Chilly Chicken: chicken perfectly cooked, gravy in the perfect amount. Delicious in short words! However, I would like to say if they could reduce the amount of soya sauce. 3) Chicken Basil Rice: perfectly cooked with ample amount of chicken filling in our mouth and stomach as well. the taste was a bit blend compared to the noodles. Thats why we had to eat with the spicy chilly sauce to make it spicy-tasty, so to speak. SERVICE: Cordial and always with a smiling face, although the service was a bit too slow.

The Ultimate Foodiee,"Rated Berco's is one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in CP. It is situated in the middle circle (close to Palika Parking and PVR Rivoli). You won't find the authentic chinese here but the chinese served here is what suits the north Indian taste buds.

Imp points: If you're travelling by car, you can use Palika Bazaar parking or if you're lucky you might get space right outside Bercos as well. For metro users, exit from Gate no. 7.

I.I wouldn't suggest venturing late in the night there for anyone be it a girl or a guy.the area maybe safe but certainly that line which connects bercos is not the safest around 11-12.Personally I would give it a miss if your not accompanied by male friends. The bercos at CP is quite extravagant when it comes to seating with 2 floors.Ground floor is a family restaurant where no hard drinks are served.The first floor has a bar with most drinks available.The last time I had sex on the beach and gin tonic for a friend.both were made nicely.yes sometimes there is shortage of beer.so be prepared to have only fosters. The seating is comfortable with good crowd on the Sunday may want to do an advanced booking on the weekends. Ambiance:-the ambiance of the place is very loungish.chilled out and relaxing.Dim lighted in the first floor and normal lighting on the ground.they have these lit aquariums which are new to most restaurants I have been to.Stylish seating made of mosaic is also appreciated. Food:-I have ordered their prawns for starters which were mindblowing.Extremely succulent.I stick to prawns in lemon butter sauce which is extremely good and chicken manchurains..i would suggest you to tell them to give you prawns in a bowl as they have a tendency to offer it in a plate as given in my pictures.shockingly the quantity reduces to bare minimum specially of the lemon butter sauce,as a matter of fact I had to tell them to bring it again as the quantity once was not upto the mark.the good thing being the manager immediately took in his stride and brought the prawns dish in a round bowl accosting to sizable quantity of the sauce and overall. You must try their prawns in lemon butter garlic sauce.I visit bercos specailly for this dish.It is one of their best and also in top 5 lemon butter prawns I have had elsewhere in Delhi. Service:-Service is ok ok.but I have noticed that they don't like to serve you.they keep the food and go away.Not that it is a big deal but now many restuarants serve you which i feel adds to the experience.I am sure management can take this into consideration.apart from that. the time taken to get our food was right on time.not more than 10-15 minutes on a busy weekend. Overall:- food:4/5 ambiance:3.5/5 Service:-4/5 layout/seating:-3/5 location of restaurant:-2.5/5",Rated 3.5,35,97,??
Natasha Vohra,"Rated It was an amazing experience visiting to bercos. I can surely say that this restaurant is on high demand among all the people as we can see people standing and waiting on long queues.But i must say its worth it.The best part was about their fruit beer offer which is currently running.Once we check in to facebook , we can avail free fruit beer. Coming to the food, it was very good, specially chicken in salt n pepper.If one have to try something different from the usual main course then one can choose Mongolian Chicken.You can find the ambiance is pretty good. The only thing which i feel they have to work out is on the presentation and the decor.If they can have stylish sofa apart from the usual once it will gonna be more rocking place. The presentation of the food should be changed slightly in a more sophisticated way. Rest all good.You can enjoy with any one i.e;Friends & family both.

Sunny,"Rated I have been fondly savoring Bercos since some time now however my last visit on 14 March was a real shocker for me. Appetizers we ordered were not up to the Bercos standard and I got a feeling that I am being served in any other chinese food joint. Beer was not chilled and food was not warm. It was still OK to the moment when we had first bite of Chilly Garlic chicken noodles, the very first sight of the noodles was not pleasant and I had my eye balls rolling. My wife gave me a foul look post tasting the noodles, even I realized that taste is very ordinary as if we are having noodles from a road side chinese van. The salt in the noodles was accumulated in one portion and was not distributed evenly. I immediately call their staff and gave feedback post which they humbly got my noodles replaced with another better-than-previous-but-not-Bercos-standard noodles. I strongly feel that they have changed either their cooks or style of cooking, post inquiry with my friends I came to know that they have closed various outlets recently however I am not sure. Always compared any other Chinese restaurant with Bercos and felt happy that Bercos is still the best but my last visit has broken my heart :(",Rated 3.0,1,0,??

I along with a friend started off with Soups Tom Yum Soup (King of Soup) and Rice Noodle soup with Burnt Ginger and felt contented with it and the soup was so clear and it slipped off the throat without itching . Then Veg Spring Rolls - He said he has never eaten rolls like that before. Pat Thai was the star of the day - a fine balance of Sweet with spice and brilliant preparation ... Rice sticks are not so easy to cook I know that because I have to cook it at home. Then Khoy Seu (sorry for the spelling) was also something extraordinary. Over all .....

Sanjay Punjabi,"Rated We being new comers to Delhi, had run out of places to dine at the end of the day's work. Zomato came in handy. Searched for popular joints in CP, discovered Berco's. Excellent ambiance, the air of a fine dining place. We ordered for a Chicken Manchow Soup (INR 115) and Chicken Wanton Soup (INR 145). Split one by two each, the quantity was commendable. The chicken Manchow soup was surprisingly white in colour. Nevertheless, extremely excellent in taste. Next we called for Minced Chicken Rice (INR 210), Mix Meat Fried Rice (INR 210) and Fish Nam Pick Pou (INR 335). Excellent choices on hindsight, I should say, though the quantity of the food was not that great shakes as posted by some other reviewers. Quantitywise, 5 Spice rules the roost. The Minced Chicken rice had french fries topping it, the mix meat rice had sufficient meat mini chunks and the Fish was in red gravy. The pics are attached here.

Manav Bhardwaj,"Rated Had a horrible experience last Saturday (Feb 1, 2014) when I visited with some of my friends, as invited by a friend who had come to India from Singapore after a long time. We went upstairs where they have a bar, as my friends wanted to have drinks as well. Let me put it point-wise: 1. Service was like it doesn't exist, as all the waiters appear to be confused 2. It took 1.5 hours to serve crispy chilli potatoes!! 3. The place was too warm to sit there without getting suffocated 4. For my friends, most drinks that they had been mentioned on their drinks menu were not available! 5. It took one hour and repeated reminders to get a drink repeated for one of my friends 7. It took more than an hour to serve the dimsum platter 8. The waiters most of the time appeared clueless about what had been ordered from our table, they needed to be reminded again and again 9. The fried rice they served was not even boiled properly 10. When we asked for the bill, they gave us wrong bill, not just once, but twice!!!!! Now, where in the world this happens!! Thinking that they cant be wrong twice, we only realized after we had paid, on the second time!!! Third time they got it right. I think, there cant be a worse experience in a restaurant than this, at least it never had been like this for us. I was so embarrassed what memories my friend would take along to Singapore of Delhi and Bercos! Earlier we had some good memories of Bercos Noida, so we thought of trying it at CP as well. We even overlooked Irish bar and other much better places nearby, but Bercos CP proved us wrong. I suggest to all the readers that Bercos in CP is just waste of your time, CP has so many better places to eat, I'm sure. Food, service, ambiance, atmosphere, and cleanliness/hygiene, everything was a big let down. We even spoke to the manger later while leaving, but we could understand, he couldn't and wouldn't do much about it.",Rated 1.0,3,0,??

Shruti M,"Rated Visited Berco's last evening for the n-th time. Since it was past 10 pm, we could find a table of our choice easily. We started with veg momos which took 20 mins to arrive but tasted good with the sauce served along with them. We also ordered a fruit beer and a mint mojito (which was exceptionally good and we asked for a second round). For main course we selected garden fresh vegetables in black pepper sauce and veg fried rice. The portions were large but the taste was very okay. We've tasted much better black pepper sauces which are not just black in colour but also well flavoured. The sauce jars were almost empty which may have been because we visited almost at the end of dinner service. The service was okay too with our servers delivering the food but not serving. The elderly door-man is by far the most courteous one may have encountered ever. The ladies' toilet could do with an exhaust fan and some air freshener. The meal was easy on the pocket but didn't clock a wow that earlier meals there have. Will we visit again? May be, because we have been eating here for eons, their service is quick and since there are no other good vegetarian-friendly Chinese eateries in CP.",Rated 3.0,67,216,??

Nothing was mention about how must i pay Service charges! After wasting 20mins he disappeared and the place did not even have a feedback form.

I would like to say that Dhabas untrained waiters will provide better service. To my surprise he brought the noodles bowl to my table in his hand straight from the kitchen and didn't even consider it necessary to serve in a tray. He moved here and there in the restaurant saying ""noodles mein to kafi tym lag gaya"" and when he brought my bill.He started reading it in front of me and said ""pata nahi cashier kya likhta hai"". I wish there was negative rating available to rate this restaurant bercos cp. Food is nothing to write about as u can get it from any roadside stall.Maybe even better at the roadside stalls.

Our experience: Ambience: Dim and Relaxed, Suitable for a romantic pocket friendly outing However, as we were seated near the order station, we could hear the staff including the manager bickering over various orders or things like who should be changing plates, serving water, etc. Food: We ordered a plate of Chilli potates and Crispy Chilli Lamb for starters along with coke and their famous fruit beer. The quantity is enough for 3 people to gorge on. The potatoes were so crispy that my jaw hurt. I have definetly had so much better. The lamb was delicious to eat. Sadly both the dishes were cold. For the main course we ordered a meal combo of Red Thai curry with rice. The rice seemed stale. The curry was passable. The fruit beer n coke did not have sufficient gas in them n had a weird after taste. Service: Something they need to work on immensely. All in all we were glad to be out of the restaurant.

Raghav Sood,"Rated My favorite place to get good Chinese/Thai food at a decent price if you want to try Chinese/Thai food then I guess Bercos is best value for money (with high quality) option. The food always tastes good, the portions are generous, and you feel good once your meal is done. } Coming to this particular branch, it has always been my go to place when I wanted to enjoy delicious chinese food in the company of my friends. And to be honest it is one of those places where you can come alone, with your college friends, with your parents or even bring a date. The ambiance of the place is classy especially the ground floor, there is a bar upstairs where you can enjoy drinks at a relatively cheap price during the happy hours. A pint of corona was for 140. Food is great, I would recommend everyone to try their honey chili potatoes, Honey Chili Chicken,Mongolian chicken and Chinese Chopsuey( not American). All types of noodles and fried rice taste great with any of the manchurian like gravy dishes. you can save some money by going for combos as well. I think these guys have done a great job not letting their quality or services go down over the years, some thing which franchises like TGIF have failed to do.

MUST TRY: Honey Chilli potato, fruit beer, mojito, pasta, schezwan noodles. Things that work for this place: -Varied food options available and visit this place for one awesome experience you will cherish for a long time, I have never tried any hard drinks here, I am really sure this place do offers it at good price. -This place survives on the policy eat more and pay less. Food is well priced here. -Ample of seating place which is distributed well between 2 floors. Best part, the whole place is well lit. I always felt that first floor is little better than ground floor so opt for second floor if possible. -Expect this place to be jam packed irrespective of the time you visit it, blame crazy popularity this place has gained in past few years.

The ambiance of the place is good, with the liquor section seperated on the first floor makes the place clean and provides choice. The food preparation is nice and the taste is above average, the starters like chicken lollypop and mushrooms tasted average nothing above that, although the taste of the main course was good. The chowmein with chilli chicken gravy impressed me with its yummy taste. Quantity of food is good and is generous.

Then there is the taste... The Chefs cook the food according to your delight.... Worth trying are the Chilli Garlic Noodle along with Veg/Non-Veg Manchurian and to top it up ask for A cold coffee with ice cream or The Mojito Mint or The Ginger fizz....

Shayeri Roy Choudhury,"Rated When it comes to Chinese I have never felt happier and satisfied than when coming out of Berco's. No meal has ever disappointed me, on the contrary, every time they surpass themselves. Their Chinese menu has a tinge of Sino-Ludhianvi-ness to it, just the right amount for the spicy Indian palette. From appetizers, to the main courses, to the Thai dishes they have, each is a delight in itself. One of the best things is that they are so reasonable. In a place like CP where food in lounges is always getting heavier on your pocket by the day, Berco's comes as such a pleasant relief. Meal for two is comfortably priced at under 1000 (that too if you pig yourselves silly), and the staff is super-friendly. Service is quick and efficient, and on weekends there's a huge rush for seats. The lounge upstairs has a simple ambiance, dimly lit, with a well stocked bar, but the attraction is surely the food. And of course, the discount I get for being a regular. ;)",Rated 5.0,21,182,??

The ambience is nice and lighting is very aptly dim, makes you feel cosy (although the AC was a bit strong). Now, the food. We had honey Chilli Potatoes and Veg Spring Rolls. The latter were best which I had in recent times. It had a lot of veggies and you could taste them fresh. They were not overstuffed and we enjoyed every bite of it. Equally good were the potatoes with right crisp and spice. We accompanied the starters with a virgin mojito and a cold coffee. Mojito was absolutely awesome and it gave me a real kick despite being non alcoholic, just loved it. Cold coffee was average and you could definitely have better ones in non- chinese restaurants. We concluded the snacker with one of their exotice desserts, Death by Chocolate. It was very nice with loads of warm chocolate sauce bathing the ice cream beneath it. Wonderful!

The dimsums were yum and the sweet chilly sauce was delicious! The chilly potatoes were very oily but they tasted good. The combos were delicious as well and the quantities were generous.

So i had to treat a friend who is really fond of chinese and i we were in CP and the first name that came to our minds was Berco's. A very well established name in the minds of those who prefer chinese with a touch of indian flavor. The ambiance is fantastic if you want to start a conversation and you leave all your worries out of the door the moment you step in. Coming to the food, we orderd the Crispy Button Mushrooms for appetizers which were fantastic and tasteful. Anyone with a taste for mushrooms should definitely try that. For the Main course we ordered Stir Fried Vegetables with Almonds and Chinese Veg Fried rice. I am sorry to say they both let us down completely. they had absolutely no flavor and the almonds were hard to come by. The rice also did live up to our expectation. Bland would be the right word. As for service, we had to ask for fresh plates for the Main Course as the staff did not offer to change them after the appetizer. We ended up paying a good amount and leaving the place unsatisfied and wondering if we would be back again. The Mushrooms were good though!",Rated 2.5,12,50,??

I remember it was initially in inner circle and then shifted to G block middle circle later. The place has changed a lot since then, but still they serve the Chinese with the desi flavour. Coming to the food, I am a fan of their five spice chicken (star chicken)and that is a must try...other specialities are shredded lamb in garlic sauce, chopsuey, chilli potato, drums of heaven, crispy honey chickenand of course you have to try their fruit beer or ginger fizz along with your order.

Saurabh Khurana,"Rated Chinese food is something which is liked by most of the people but to get good and authentic Chinese food is bit difficult. i am one of those people who like Chinese food as snacks not as main course meal even though its quite heavy to eat especially when it is had with some carbonated drink. And Berco's is a place where I got authentic Chinese food which is also value for money specially their prawn and pork dishes. As per rating for ambience 3/5, food 5/5, service 4/5 beverages 4/5 I would like to share one of my experience which i had while roaming in CP on hot sunny day with my friend and at same time feeling very hungry. we found nearby restaurant was BERCO'S but as i was hungry i wanted some Indian food but my friend wanted to try it as its one my favourite Chinese joint so decided to go there but after reaching there , it was so disappointing that we were in waiting list and other restaurant were far away and what if we go to other restaurant ,will get the table as it was weekend so mostly restros are full, so we decided to wait there only but I know how i was controlling my hunger But may be God knew that how difficult for me to control hunger...In a very short time Restaurant Hostess came and greeted by asking ""Would you like to sit in Lounge ?"" I have been there two -three times before and was not knowing there was second floor also.,anyways we said yes , and she guided us the way it was good that we din't get place at dine area as it was very crowdy and here I was surprised when i met my senior MOHIT POPLI Sir who was manager overthere.Oh my GOd ,may thats why i din't get place downstairs so that we could meet him Without wasting any time we ordered chicken preparation (name i don't remember but it was sweet in taste and chicken in it was very juicy) and veg noodles followed by Tiger beer from Thailand(as suggested by Mohit Sir) it was very light in taste but very smooth.It was nice chit chat with sir about old college days and ofcourse Chinese food. just added one of best experience at Berco's Cheerss.......",Rated 4.0,16,172,??

Ahmad Rizvi,"Rated Berco's Chinese has been ""the food"" for a lot of people and the brand has been synonymous to the Indian Chinese in Delhi. With its presence at various locations, Bercos has existed for a long time and usually gets its business more from repeat customers which shows the power of their food. The one at Connaught place was earlier more strategically located at the inner circle but was smaller in size. The location now has been shifted to the middle circle with a bigger facility. As I said earlier, they more rely on repeat customers, they will follow you wherever you go and now the customers have more comfortable place to eat. That was the right move by the restaurant. Out of the umpteen visits to this place, I have literally walked through the menu and tasted everything which I wanted to eat. Now the discovery factor is gone, unless they have something new, and my steady state has begun. Now I am well seated to give my opinion. The centre of attraction has always been food here. People from various walks are visible in this restaurant, ranging from school kids to the college kids, a bag packer to a business man with his wife, an office goer to a shopaholic with a lot of shopping bags. No matter what time you go to Bercos, you will never have the feeling of being alienated. This place is packed almost anytime. Sometime packed more than the capacity and sometime just to the capacity. At lunch time be ready to wait for a good 20-30 min sometimes if the darbaan standing outside is not smiling at you. Food, as I said is the main attraction here. They have got the taste right which matches to our Indian palate. Most of the dishes are spicy and have an option of being more spicy on request. The serving quantity are good and you can rely on the same quality even if you visit them 100 times. Their lunch combos are a hit for the office goers who dont want to waste any time deciding what to eat. My fav over there is Crispy Chilli Lamb which I never fail to order. On my last visit to Bercos, I wanted to eat something which I have never had before, hence I went for the Burmese Khao Suey. I really didnt had any idea of its taste before but I loved it to the last bits. Maybe the taste of the original Khao Suey is very different but the beauty of this place is that they know how to serve to their Indian customers. I love going back to Bercos whenever I can. If you really want that Indian Chinese when you are at CP, go and find this place and you will not be disappointed.",Rated 3.5,150,1009,??
Ruben Chaudhury,Rated Berco's is a place where i always love to be when it comes to chinese although a bit Indianised but real good food especially the thai cuisine. It also serves Khou-suey which is awesome along with some heartwarming Claypots. The overall ambience is nice and service is good and worth mentioning is the guard at the gate who always welcomes you with a big smile for god knows how many years now. Its a good experience everytime I visit where me and my girlfriend always comes out with a smile. We especially never miss the pork items in the menu which is although limited to only 5 items but during my last visit I was shocked to see the pork items not included in their new menu. But after my query i was told they still serve on request and i got my double fried pork so pork lovers dont be dishearted. Its sad though.

The ambience makes you feel you are in a fine dining restaurant with a good temperature inside. The decoration is very well done and the good part is, it is located in the very centre of the national capital, hence people come from Gurgaon,noida, south delhi, north delhi and connaught place has always been one of the most visited and popular places in Delhi hence the restaurant has a really good location. The prices are reasonable after seeing the quality of food and the overall restaurant, its ambience and the hospitality. They deal with customers really well. The snacks are relishing. I usually order the chilly paneer, the honey potatoes and the vegetable dimsums. they re very well cooked and one gets tempted to order more. I feel the starters are the USP of Berco's connaught place. The main course is also very good always but in Indian chinese, the starters are always more relished hence I go there to stuff myself with the starters.

Good food and good service. Meal for 2 has always been less than a 100 rupees. Portions are very generous.,Rated 4.0,106,361,??
Ritika Khurana,"Rated Worst will be praising you.I know this might come as very rude but truth has to be bitter.I don't mind waiting for 10 minutes on a busy day but when i requested to be seated in restaurant i was offered sitting for 5 in the lounge which was nothing less than a disaster.We a family of five were made to sit next to the bar which was too noisy.The ambience was ok, nothing extraordinary.We ordered for veg snacks and we were offered chicken and later was replaced very promptly without making obvious for other customers. Any tortoise could have served me faster than they did. Chinese rest. such as bercos did not have any chop sticks...strange isn't it? When we requested for check and questioned as to how can the rest charge service tax on top of the total bill and not only on the service charge which is against the law.Manager simply responded to this in a very rude manner pointing out to TIN number to complaint where ever i want to. This was simply unacceptable.I would in my whole life would ever go to this RESTAURANT. WORST EXPERIENCE EVERRRRRRR....",Rated 1.0,1,0,??

Kunal,"Rated Hi , I've been to Bercos restaurant on a few occasions. The food has been good and the portion served has always been generous. But today i ordered for home delivery, which i consider my biggest mistake. Not only were the portions delivered below expectation , (they were only good enough for a couple of small children to be served) but were below expectation as far as taste s are concerned. I MUST also mention about of the gentleman who took my order . Mr Vijay Pandey whose the in-charge of CP branch for delivery. He not only assured of generous serving portions but also good taste of the food . But whatever this gentleman promised was absolutely utter rubbish. A small piece of advice to the management , please do not make false promises to your customers , because you fall short of all expectations head on .",Rated 1.5,1,0,??

Thai food is okay, but would recommend Chinese..Dimsums all time favourite..over priced, but signature.. Try out the manchow soup both for veg and Thupka for non veg lovers..Appetizers are usual as at all places, but if you like fish, Chilli Garlic Fish and Juicy Chicken Drumsticks.. Main course, i would pick Chili Chicken with Steam Rice...This is the best pick !! 190 rupees of total worth..Rice soaked in chilli chicken gravy and spicy schezuan sauce.. Lemon Coriander fish is brilliant.. a little non spicy kind of good buy..I woudnlt go for vegetarian food..but if at all, honey chilii potato in chunky sauce..!!

Niharika.Loves.To.Eat,"Rated Whatever used to be 'top' notch once in Connaught Place has now been replaced. Berco's is one of those restaurants which lost their hegemony long back, although it is still crowded and has a long waiting list standing outside. I believe that the name this franchise has created is what causes the stir and not the food, ambience, service or the pricing. Just like The Host, it too failed to produce good quality food over time, did not care to reevaluate its menu and the service... well, it became worse over the years. Moreover, it strangely relocated itself within the inner circle, which proved to be another disastrous choice as those old customers who could have frequented the joint in the hope of some nostalgia wouldn't want to visit it anymore, and that includes me as well. When I was a child and I craved root beer, my family always took me to Berco's. Therefore, it was quite natural for me to be disappointed when I heard that it had been shifted to a not-so-easy-to-find spot in CP somewhere. Moreover, when I finally found it, I didn't like it at all. The ambience was too fast-food like for my taste, there was too much noise inside and I couldn't communicate with my group. And the food that was served was cold, stale and just an embarrassment, especially as I had insisted that my friends try this one out for my sake ! They all could have easily visited Tao or Side Wok instead. Further, the servers didn't care to take my order but they were creepily hovering around at the time of the cheque. Sheesh! Additionally, they did not have my root beer and it couldn't get any worse ! From the soups to the starters, to the main course and then to the dessert nothing tasted exceptional. The presentation was very bad as well. When they placed the bowl of noodles on our table, most of it spilled over. And the piece of chocolate cake that they gave us was upside down and therefore all the frost on the top was stuck on the plate ! Did they expect us to lick it off? Well we did ! And that was the only fun part of being at Berco's, Connaught Place. For 2 drinks, two starters, 2 main course dishes and two desserts, our bill came up to Rs. 2700 (inclusive of tips and taxes). Not bad, however everything else was just below average. Not recommended.",Rated 2.5,441,6711,??

Dhrupad Suri,"Rated I've been eating at Bercos for a very long time. I remember the previous one that was in Inner Circle. The place has changed but the doorman is still the same. That humble man whom I've seen becoming older year after year but his way of greeting and smile has not changed over the years. The ambience is that of any nice Chinese restaurant with crowd coming in loads. I ordered a Crispy Chilly Garlic Chicken, Chicken and Egg Fried Rice, Chilly Garlic Noodles and not to forget the Bercos special American Chopsuey. The crispy chicken was very crunchy, not authentic but a nice chicken 'pakora' sorts. The rice was very aromatic and delightful. The noodles tickled the taste buds with their spicy flavour and the chopsuey is good as always.

The ambience is very nice and the low hanging lights just add to the set-up. Staff has always been courteous. Coming to the food, in my last visit I ordered crispy chilly potato (my all time favourite on their menu), Clay Pot Rice and fruit beer. I tried the clay pot rice for the first time and was quiet happy with it. Turned out to be a light dish, filling enough for 2 people after a good dose of starters. However, I was disappointed with the service. The staff did not seem to be that bothered. I hope they take note of the recent drop in their service and take action to get back to their previous levels. Nevertheless, the guard at the entrance never fails to give you the warmest welcome and the most genuine thank you, it always brings a huge smile. :)",Rated 3.5,3,190,??

Arshdeep Kaur,"Rated Berco's has been in CP since time immemorial (though the locations keep changing within CP) and is easily one of the best Standalone Chinese restaurants in Delhi. You'd never ever go he re and find a table right away. And if you have to wait, don't get discouraged. Spend some time with the Doorman. He is quite a character and is sure to bring a smile on your face with his antics. As you enter, you see a Buddha statue at the end of the corridor, along with dim lighting and lots of noise ( but then you can't expect quite in a restaurant where you have to wait to get a table , can you?) The seating is comfy but the sofas could have been better) The staff is fine and the service can tend to be a bit slow on weekends. Also, it is quite cheap when compared to the new places popping up everywhere. For around 2000 bucks, a family of four can PIG OUT. Whenever I eat here, the bill is never more than 2500 (including drinks). The food is mostly Chinjabi, with a few splatters of authentic here n there.The must tries are: 1. Crispy Honey Chili Chicken (only if you like your chicken sweet and have string teeth and the patience to chew for a looong time) 2. The Chili Chicken - the essential 3. The lemon Chicken - a tangy, lemony preparation with pineapple 4. American Chop Suey 5. The Chicken Drumsticks 6. Hot n Sour Chicken Soup - Hearty n Filling 7. Sour n Pepper Chicken Soup Can Avoid: 1. Spring Rolls- One Word: Bleh! 2. Chili Potato However, the one thing I didn't like was when I and my Sis asked for chopsticks, they said that only 1 pair was available. Maybe they expect everyone to use forks like most of their patrons. (My Sis did give the server her Mean Face though). To sum up, a nice place that can be visited often.",Rated 4.0,29,70,??

Here's my take on Berco's:- Food: 3.5/5 After finding succour in the waiter's counsel on what to order, we ordered hot and sour soup, fried mushrooms, chill garlic noodles and manchurian. The soup was thick and very filling. The mushrooms were a bit oily and so were the noodles. The manchurian however was delicious-the gravy was thick and the manchurian balls were filling. Ambience: 4/5 I liked the Buddha at the end of the hall alley, also liked the lamps and the green feel to the place thanks to the many artificial plants potted here. Service: 5/5 The service staff was really nice, warm and courteous, and apparently a lot of the stewardshave been at Berco's for more than 10 years-kudos to the management for retaining them!

The music over here was also really good, a mix of contemporary and classic rock and the volume was just right neither loud nor low. The food we ordered, Veg Singapore Noodles and Assorted Veg in Hot Garlic Sauce was above average than what I expected.

I found my way to it years ago when it was still in its old location in Inner circle and was kicking myself for not going there earlier. While the move has not made it easier to go there I still find myself braving the horrors that is CP these days to get a meal there as other places and even branches just don't compare. While I can't comment on the Non veg items I have your say that the amount of choice and quality of the vegetarian options is second to none. Also the people there have always been willing to cater to dietary restrictions so it's a great place to head to with a group of friends or family. The service is great and the size of the servings along with scrumptious food make it a great value for money place.

We tried the Dimsums, Crispy Chilly Vegetable, Crispy Chilly Potato, Juicy Chicken Drumsticks among many other starters. Each and every single starter was so good that we didn't feel like ordering for the main course. But if you have to try, then their Chilly Garlic Crispy Vegetable, Honey Chilly Potato and Chicken Drumsticks are a must try.

The place was full of crowd inside and it was too noisy to even listen to your own friends. For the starters we decided to go with Crispy Lamb and Chilly Potatoes. And for the mains, we ordered Veg Manchurian with Fried Rice, Chilly Garlic and Veg Hakka noodles. Good points first. The Crispy Lamb was good. It was perfectly crisp and the taste of marinate and lamb blended well. the manchurian tasted good too. But the noodles were sticky. And it was really disappointing because the whole meal got spoiled due to the noodles. The service was sloppy. I think the reason might be the amount of rush that was inside the place.

We ordered Veg Sweet Corn Soup, Veg Salt and Pepper, Hakka Noodles, Chilli Paneer and Cold Coffee. Coffee was watery. You expect a good basic Sweet Corn Soup almost everywhere, but the soup at Berco's was disappointing and so was Veg Salt and Pepper. Chili Paneer and Hakka Noodles were good, but nothing exceptional about either of them. All in all, an over hyped place.

Rajeev Nangia,"Rated I have a policy for reviewing chain restaurants wherein I rate them half on the chain philosophy and the other half on the location , well that is a policy I will not follow while rating this place . Because for me Berco's CP ( actually the older location in the Inner Circle ) will always be a stand alone with tonns of nostalgia . Back in 80""s Berco""s was one of the very few Restaurants around town and with exception of Fujiya on Malcha Marg any place you could get Chinese . Even though everyone prefers calling it Punbinese or Punjabi Chinese now but for most of my generation in Delhi it was the real thing . Now years after eaten around the globe including loads of places in the interiors of Mainland China this cuisine still remains a favorite . Actually the Indian Chinese Cuisine, taken every where we Indians migrated , has become a global phenomena now and I have eaten Indian hinese at restaurants all over USA including Chicago , New York & Los Angles . Enough about the cuisine , Berco's with it""s unique tastes can be tiring at times , the staff can be a bit non concerned and the place too loud but this was what restaurants were till the great Indian Fine/Gourmet dinning exposition of this century . All the soups there are my favorite , on my last visit I had a sweet Corn Chicken Soup , the only joint I will order this dish in today's age of Lemon & Coriander and more finer flavors . Hot and Sour and Talumin are my other two choices . For main I had an American Chopsuey again heavenly . Hakka Noodles are always nice as is the Pepper Chicken . To sum it up in today's age when I absolutely love the food at My Humble House , I still go back , and hope to continue going back to Berco's for food served with a side of memories :)",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Bikram Bindra,"Rated Berco's is the place to be when it comes to the Chinjabi school of food ( Chinese+ Punjabi), and oh it is so so good! Comfort food at honest prices and that nice homely feel which is tinted with just the right amount of nostalgia. My clear favourites here- you cannot miss the Chili Potatoes- crisp, chunky with a hint of sweetness. Good soups, with my all time favourite being their hearty Chicken Sweet Corn Soup. Other crowd pullers on their menu are the American Chop suey and the Egg Fried Rice. A new discovery the last time I visited Berco's is their version of the Khousuey, and I must admit I was pleasantly surprised! Manages to retain the various textures and flavours even though the dish is served all together in bowl. The new location in the middle lane is a bit of a downer, but once you have been ushered in, the brisk service and the friendly banter all around you will make sure you at ease immediately. Perfect for lunch with old school buddies.",Rated 4.0,113,483,??
Rakesh Verma,"Rated The joint serves good food at reasonable prices. The entry to the outlet at present in a way puts you off because of the repair work which has been going on for at least two years. The chinese food is tasty, it is an affordable version of Mainland China. The food is not as good as Mainland China but a real value for money.",Rated 4.0,7,14,??
Nikita Sailesh,"Rated Berco's is always the name that pops up in my head whenever I want comfort Chinese food delivered at my doorstep! Although the food is typically chin-jabi and not the authentic kind which many a Chinese-food connoisseur would look for, it makes up for that by focussing on an extensive menu with plenty of options for the meat-lover (Pork, Lamb, Fish- endless options!) Whenever I order, I usually stick to the Crispy Chilli Lamb (great value for money), Thai red curry (flavorful) and fried rice. However, the menu offers a variety to choose from. My overall opinion- it's great for takeout!",Rated 3.0,3,152,??
Varun Srivastava,"Rated Well, Berco's is tarnished presently by its location due to our greatness, NDMC ruining CP now for years. I have been to hundreds of Chinese eateries but there is something about the food these people serve that absolutely pulls me towards them in an instant. The Fruit Beer is quiet famous out here. You can order anything out of the menu here and you are going to relish the same to the perfection finishing every bit of it is there in your bowl .Enjoy the amazing food as you chitchat with your loved ones in the cosy seatings.",Rated 5.0,102,503,??
Kunal Bisht,Rated Excellent food but the catch here is that you need to wait for a while to get it as the place is well packed and a waiting time of upto 30 min or more during peak hours. Once you get it the place is nice. It not too big but mirrors have been put to good use. The good is excellent both veg and non veg. The staff were polite and well behaved. 5stars!!!,Rated 5.0,15,72,??
WoMenon,"Rated Berco's is a place like home. There are tons of chinese restaurants in this city. But this is a place that always calls out to me. Their quality of food has been consistent! Crispy Chilly Potatoes were my favourite when I first ate at Berco's over 5 years ago, and I make it a point to order them even now when i go there. The starters easily take the cake, with other particular favourites being Chicken drumsticks, pepper chicken, and chilly paneer! The main course (Hakka Noodles + Garlic Chicken + Hong Kong Vegetables) was light and scrumptious! I always try a new combination with every visit! Because there is just so much variety on the menu. Vareity is however lacking when it comes to desserts, and I hope that soon they do add more options to it! Best value-for-money Chinese restaurant I have come across!",Rated 4.0,22,63,??
Oda.lmr09,Rated Berco's. The food is so so yum. Whenever I'm in Delhi with my Fiancee' we won't miss it!! Cheers guys!! There is no food which I don't like. I love it all. See ya soon,Rated 5.0,1,2,??
Amit Walia,"Rated In case you r looking to eat Chinese food at reasonable rates Berco's is the place to be. The food is not comparable with the likes of mainland china but it is definitely trying to get up there. Chicken Lollipop, Veg/Non Veg Stir Fried Noodles, Veg/Non Veg American Chopsuey are among the few favorites that are worth mentioning. Honey Chlli potatoes are an all time favorite. :) The food at Connaught Place outlet is definitely best amongst all Berco's outlets. Please avoid Berco's at Kamla Nagar market, the food there is horrible and the service is not up to the mark.",Rated 4.0,22,17,??
I.p.,"Rated Yes, as everyone tells you this really is chinjabi food. But everything there is really delicious! I'm a big fan of their Hot Garlic Fish, Chicken Hongkong, Dimsums and well everything is really tasty. Your taste buds end up pretty happy there. So go if you wanna enjoy, have good food with friends or family. its the perfect place to be. The ambiance is nice too. But if you're looking for true authentic Chinese with a more subtle taste, this might not work for you. Well if you go, do try the refreshing fruit beer, perfect to accompany your hot spicy meal. :)",Rated 4.0,14,11,??
Pooja Khanna,"Rated There is always that one place where you go for ""comfort food"". Where you never read the menu, because you know it by heart! For me that place is and has always been Bercos. I have been a regular since my college since my college days when their Diced Chicken in Black Pepper Sauce, Fried Rice and Fruit Beer was my standard meal to go with a very important gossip session! I continue to go back to Bercos simply for their consistency in taste (consistency over time not sure across outlets) and their quick service. The menu is good across veg and non veg, with enough options to confuse you initially but slowly you end up picking your favourites. The staff is polite and you don't have to wait too much for your order. A great place to grab a quick meal!",Rated 4.0,61,3326,??

Anika Verma,"Rated I have always loved it for its Chilli Potatoes and this time I tried the Thai Curry which was yumazing! The cocktails are well-made unlike other places where they serve ice sprinkled with droplets of alcohol, thankfully. Prices are reasonable. Berco's #FTW",Rated 4.0,39,271,??
Arshita,"Rated Nice place to hang around with friends. Good food. The portions are enough to be shared by 2. Wholesome food at affordable prices. Nice ambiance, a bit dark in the lounge area. Good services. Crispy vegetables are a must have.",Rated 3.0,7,23,??
Jeff,"Rated This is going to be a bad review, so I'll start off on a positive note -- the reason we tried Berco's was we have friends who really love it. But not us. We had it delivered, and that was fine -- it came hot and within a reasonable amount of time. But quite honestly, though we know there are many interpretations of Chinese food around the world and we tend to be forgiving, we could recognize nothing as what it was supposed to be. Lemon Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Hot and Sour Soup -- all tasted like something else altogether. We are not Chinese food snobs, but this was truly awful. If it tasted good, but just not like the dish it was alleged to be, we could have handled it, but it was really bad. The reason for 2 stars instead of 1 is that the delivery aspect of the order was fine.",Rated 2.0,3,3,??
Susmita Sinha,Rated One of the best places for regular Chinese food! Though rum here was costlier than at Zen :P Really liked their Chicken Hongkong! Berco's is good at food that's a tad bit spicy!,Rated 5.0,155,1631,??
Vinti Singal,Rated The street Vendor near my home serves tastier Chinjabi food. They served us Fried Rice and Manchurian which was the worst ever I have had. I fail to believe that a restaurant calling itself a Chinese one cannot muster up basic Manchurian gravy and fried rice. I love Chinese food and what I was served was by far the most disgusting food I have ever had. Not recommended.,Rated 1.0,1,13,??
Nidhi Verma,Rated This place serves the worst Chinese that I've ever had! We ordered lemon chicken and what we got was - under cooked chicken served with pineapple chunks in a NIMBU PANI gravy. The manchurian was a disgrace and they even managed to screw the fried rice! The cutlery and plates were dirty and the waiters were so nonchalant. My advice to people is to not even think of going to Bercos.,Rated 1.0,3,3,??
Kunal Daryanani,Rated I strongly recommend this place for college going students who do not want to spend too much and still want to have a good dining experience. This is the best you can get in these prices and the helpings are also pretty generous. The creamy garlic chicken is delicious.,Rated 5.0,11,239,??
Shobhitasayshi,"Rated Bercos food is very good, the best is it's quantity. Me and my friend had ordered honey chilly potato as starters which was too much as starters for both of us, with tom Collins, and pina colada as cocktails. The starters and drinks were well enjoyed, main course.- fish plachod was too sweet so we had to send it back. Then we ordered chicken peking and corn rice. We were full enough by then and we still ended up wasting some food. The ambiance on the 1st floor is the best, especially the sofa seats with dim lights and nice background. The staff could have been better, in terms of taking the order, one should smile or suggest Good food rather than standing like a robot with a dull face.",Rated 3.0,6,6,??
Mayank Bhutani,"Rated We were handed the menu as we sat. We asked for a glass of water to begin with which for some reason took 10 minutes and three more requests to be served. With very affordable happy hours, eye balls popping prices. The Menu included JD, Glenfiddich, Black label and good other good brands but none of them were available and the choices were Teacher's and 100 pipers only. Starters seemed good, I only wish they understood what we really wanted without bringing us the wrong order. We ordered 4 rounds of teacher's for all and the last round we were told we are being served 100 pipers when I objected to it. The waiter was quick to change the name of the same shots to Teacher's shamelessly. With the liquor which didn't seem to be original or adulterated and food which wasn't as lip smacking. I would not recommend Berco's Lounge at CP. I may need one more visit to change my Opinion but I really don't want to waste my money.",Rated 2.0,11,74,??
Srijana M,"Rated My problem with the food is it is definitely not Chinese and it is not fair that Bercos is advertised as one. It is more like an amalgam of Punjabi with a little bit of Chinese, but done in a very vulgar fashion with lot of (uncalled for) creativity by the 'cook'. I have heard people complain about this place etc etc etc but the few times that I have been (dragged) there, the place is always crowded! There actually is a waiting to be seated inside that air conditioned seating. Plus the place is very very noisy. If you are looking to have a quiet meal, forget about it. If you are looking to have a Chinese meal, this is not the place to be. There is nothing oriental about the food in this place.",Rated 1.0,5,7,??
Namit Bhalla,"Rated One of the excellent restaurants in the past, now become totally worthless. Went there yesterday. Most surprising thing was they didn't have more than 1 brand of beer during dinner time, when their menu boasts of about 4-5 types. People on our next table were waiting for their dish and asked the waiter for it and he very rudely replied ""Once its ready, we'll serve you"". Asked them for room temperature water, but they only had chilled cold water. Bizarre! The food was, well, a little better than the roadside chowmein stalls. Totally a waste of money and time. Really really disappointed.",Rated 1.0,13,27,??
Bhupinder Singh Makker,"Rated I love to try new cuisine and for Chinese and Thai food, my most preferred place is Bercos, C.P., Delhi. Ambiance - Refreshing and soothing. Space is very well utilised. Cuisines - Thai and Chinese. Hard drinks available with great variety. a. Quality of food is good and Quantity assessment according to price quoted should be done. b. Recommendations for food :- Starter - Spring rolls / Veg manchow soup / Honey chilli potato. Main Course - Thai red/green curry(veg & non veg) with boiled rice. Chinese - Manchurian with Noodles/ Fried rice ( Veg& non veg) with a chilled fruit beer. Service Rating - 3/5 Serving time - 15-20 min Waiters are neatly dressed according to theme of restaurant and polite in nature.",Rated 4.0,3,7,??
Sudipto Das,Rated It is extremely bad!! It beats me how can people actually call it good Chinese food. 1. Food is greasy 2. The waiters aren't prompt. They just Idle around looking everywhere. 3. Chinese is bad. Like really bad. Street vendor type. 4. Cutlery they present is so bad. I don't expect the fork and spoon to be wrapped up in a single NAPKIN and presented 5. The plates were Dirty. 6. The AC's weren't working. Even though the restaurant was empty. I sweated through my meal. Truly the worst experience ever. I just couldn't wait to get up and leave that place. Not recommended ever!!,Rated 1.0,4,195,??
RAHUL,"Rated Bercos- Perfect place to ruin your day ! I called them on the phone, they said they take no reservations, but, they insisted I should just come half an hour before the scheduled time, book my table for 8-10 people and they will give it to me For SURE. I confirmed twice, and even called the next day to confirm that I WILL get a table with maximum waiting time of 30 minutes, on the particular day. They also told me they have a birthday discount and assured that they do have birthday celebrations like this, and they will be able to manage. I confirmed and called my friends at 4 pm. Now, on the birthday, I reached at 3 pm, booked the table for 10 people. They have two floors- first and ground. First they said they will give me a table on first floor in 30 minutes maximum, and asked us to wait outside. I kept waiting and waiting {in cold December weather, by the way} Other People in the restaurant kept coming and going and we kept waiting. We got a table at 5 pm. That is 2 hours late. And after that, in the end they gave the bill without the birthday discount they offered. I told this to the person in charge, and she was very arrogant. She said I should have informed them before, and now no discount will be given. Then she came with an excuse that discount is only Mon-Thursday! Later, I also puked out the Chinese food in the loo. Something was wrong with the food also. So, my suggestion is that NEVER go there if you are a group of more than 4 people. In fact, do not go there at all. I liked them when I went last year, but they have degraded to a large extent now. If they are charging us some price, at least maintain quality food. The food is pretty average and not value for money. Service is awful.!",Rated 1.0,1,7,??
Amit Gupta,"Rated Food is exemplary. Service is excellent. Ambiance is cramped, as was before, but neat and clean. Cost is very very low compared to some other Oriental joints around Delhi. For food so tasty, they charge nothing. My all time favorite in Chinese/Thai",Rated 5.0,2,62,??
Param,"Rated This is a great place for food. I am a regular, however if you order a delivery it takes more than twice the time from any other restaurant. On top of that I can think of half the time they either missed something or mixed orders.",Rated 4.0,5,93,??
