Twinkle Gupta,"Rated Good place to chill. Nice food. Loved dahi kebab and the Oreo chocolate shake served over here. I have been here twice. Would love to visit again. Just one flaw, the staff isn't courteous enough.",Rated 3.0,2,15,??
Anuj Kumar,"Rated I have been to Vault a few times since it opened towards end of 2014. My most recent visit was on 1st Jan and I must say that the standards have gone down over the last few months. The staff, service, food, music etc. are all pretty worse off than earlier. Music was especially bad. Even the crowd which once used to be fashionable has moved on to newer places. I am surprised that even with such an excellent location and terrace seating, Vault has not been able to hold onto it's aura and hype.",Rated 3.0,5,1,??
Lakshay Dulani,Rated No use of reserving a table on zomato Ambience is ok ok Food is awful Drinks are good Staff is ok ok in courtesy The vault idea is kindaa ok ok too,Rated 2.5,26,35,??
Krit Singh Jamdagni,Rated Must visit if u are @cp one of d best dining available here awesome ambience and crowd. Staff management and managers are very helpful and was very dedicated to their work. value for money is worth it. If u are good foodie.. u must be here.. Had one plate hara paneer tikka.. dahi kabaab.. thai pad.. 3pints of beer one breezer.. One pan flavoured sheesha..one diet coke.. only worth rs 3200 So spending of money @ the vault is worth it. Love to visit it again.,Rated 4.5,6,1,??
Padmaza Talukdar,Rated One of the best lounges I've ever been to. Super awesome interiors! Food is good.. Drinks come in a variety.. The bar is the best place there. Most convenient location.. The only complaint I have is that the place is overpriced and overrated! Taxes are sky high. And this keeps the place comparatively unpopular with the younger generation..,Rated 2.0,2,32,??
Payal Soni,"Rated Went to the Vault Cafe in cannaught place delhi, with a couple of friends to hangout on last Saturday night. It was the perfect choice! The ambience is swanky and the music playing in the background is perfect, not too loud. We enjoyed some of the cocktails that tasted delicious and really well made. We didnt eat a full meal but snacked on their bar bites which were perfect with the drinks. Overall, a great time!",Rated 4.0,5,137,??
Amlan Biswas,"Rated Nice Ambience, Good Food. A nice place to hang out with friends. A good cafe to spend your time, affordable drinks. BUT THE VAULT CAFE SHOULD NOT ALLOW CHILDREN INSIDE. AREA IS NOT HEALTHY FOR CHILD'S. I saw some people's with the child's not even 1 year also.",Rated 3.0,0,1,??
Vijyantj,Rated Balcony seating in the middle of winter afternoon with a view like CP is something you just can't miss. Food was delicious. Dal makhni scored 7/10 Had a good time drinking with friends although I am a little disappointed with the variety of beers actually available vs what was offered on the menu. Veg wantons were nice Chicken tikka was appetising Very affordable. Didn't think 6 people could drink n eat in a place like this in the middle of CP with such a reasonable bill.,Rated 4.5,62,266,??
Ridima Agrawal,"Rated It's a good place to chill in cp and I have been here a few times now. The ambience is nice, staff is courteous and their cocktails are amazing ! The liit, mojito and sangria are good, also the theatrics of bringing cocktails in a vault is interesting. They also serve good hukkah and food. On my most recent visit I had veg salt and pepper, Mediterranean platter, mix sauce pasta and veg pizza, everything was fine except for the pizza which was a bit bland. Would definitely visit again for their liit !",Rated 3.5,45,172,??
Vipul Jai,Rated This has been a go-to place for every mood. Really upbeat feel to the ambience and the staff. The staff at this place is exceptionally courteous and go out of their way to make your visit a fun outing. Their Nachos and chicken wings are really good. And onion rings are to die for. Alcohol prices are on a reasonable side and therefore this place usually has high football on the weekends. Shout out to Mr. Yogesh for being courteous and making us feel welcome.,Rated 5.0,4,1,??
Roli Khandelwal,Rated The interior is just amazing. They have separate vaults if u want to have some private party. Food was also good (not the best). Ambience was refreshing.,Rated 4.0,2,22,??
Rajinder Ram Grover,"Rated Pub ambience, a bit dark, lots of tables and couches around them. Definitely a place to party. I visited at the wrong hour of the day, after noon. It was the couple crowd at a couple of tables. The place seemed shady for daytime and i felt i came to this place at the wrong time. I anyway ordered a sheesha for myself. Double apple sheesha is the standard by which i test every place. And as it turns out, they dont have any idea how to make a good sheesha. The 3.5 on my rating is just for good food and good ambience for the evenings. We ordered Bun Omelette and a Arrabiatta pasta which turned out to be good infact! Although the presentation could have been a bit better for the price. But the food passed for lunch and i got the hell out of there the moment i was done eating. PS. They have private vaults for big groups, you should really check it out! Their USP!",Rated 3.5,36,102,??

Akshi Sharma,"Rated I went to the Vault Cafe on a weekend with a friend for this first time. We booked a table online which helped us get in easily. As soon as we stepped in we realised this place is huge!! Music was loud but till the time you get to hear the right kind of music you don't mind it being loud. The food that we ordered was a Pizza and some snacks along with drinks. The food was decent and the ambience was a perfect setup to have a good time with a bunch of friends, especially if you get a Vault all by yourself. They also have terrace area which is also a good option depending on the weather. On the whole my experience here was very good and yes not to forget the staff here is good at hospitality.",Rated 4.0,17,40,??
Piyush Sengar,"Rated Visited Sunday evening, booked through Dineout and availed 15% discount on food and beverage, which is something amazing. The place was full and after waiting for almost half an hour got the outdoor table. We were party of 8 and outdoor seating was just a perfect place for us to enjoy our evening.. The interior justified the name of the cafe.. The music were amazing only international tracks were playing in the beginning but the dj played punjabi as well as Bollywood tracks later on.. Ordered Veg Tandoori plater having, tandoori paneer, fried chaap,button mushrooms, broccoli it was nice not great non-veg platter on the other hand were better, garlic chicken dimsums were mouthwatering, melted as soon as entered the mouth, consisting freshly minced chicken. However Bharwa or filled Tangri ( Chicken Leg Piece) were stale and tasteless. We have ordered for premium Hookah with Vanilla and some other mix flavours and trust me that it was the best hookah I have ever had.. It was a huge Egyptian hookah which made us high with the first Puff only... Drinks are on but expensive side in comparison to the same category of pubs/cafes, however the overall experience were just too good, we have enjoyed the evening to the core..",Rated 4.5,57,341,??

Mani Kwatra,Rated A team of us dined here on Monday night - and as this was my first experience of a themed cafe bar- this was truly memorable.

Simon Rodrigues,Rated There are SO many restaurants and bars in Connaught place to choose from. We went in blind and just picked this one out of many. We were not disappointed! The Vaults as separate cubicles that gives you a kind of private space to sit and chit chat. The music and vibe is fantastic. We sat outside and had a nice view of the city. The staff was helpful. The drinks and food we ordered was pretty upto the mark. The bubble gum flavour HUKKA was just amazing...,Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Himanshu Sharma,"Rated So tomorrow the 1st of February marks the 6th year of my beautiful relationship with even more beautiful lady my love. But our job restrictions made us celebrate it a day prior. I've been looking up for a place that can give me what I expected. I was looking for a place in Connaught Place. The delhi's ""apna"" hang out adda. And after running through a list of cafe bars pubs and lounges I find out about the vault cafe. Now as we enter the cafe we find a place that we were not comfortable with. And to our surprise one of the waiters asked us if we would like to shift to some other place those couches were comfortable. But one thing that didn't go right was despite the fact that I had 2 seats reserved the waiters said they we were not aware about it, could have been an issue for a customer but I was happy with the couches we were on. Now it was not surprising to see a hukkah being smoked on every table a sight I have earlier witnessed at one Boulevard. We ordered an orange and peach hukkah which was amazing. Along with the sheesha chilli potato were also ordered. The sheesha and the feed came in on time nither fast nor too Slow. After sheesha we ordered dal makhni lachha paratha and a butter naan. The naan was more of a roti. But it didn't matter much, as the food was delicious and ample. Service was good waiters were responding to every call. The crowd was amazing, decor was beautiful and I liked the vault concept for bigger spaces. And finally India's win over Australia made the place and the evening even more cheerful. Concluding the money part. One mix sheesha chilli potato dal makhni 3 lachha paratha and a naan could only pull out 2300 out to f my pocket. 1/2 point down for the reservation blunder but it didn't matter to me and the naan. Else this place is a heaven. Manager sahab kudos. Good job. I'm definitely looking forward for another visit.",Rated 4.5,7,15,??

Sameer Poddar,"Rated We had read a lot about the place and were looking forward to this. But when we reached there, we were told that they don't allow kids on weekends there. This is no where mentioned on their information page. Despite our request to accommodate as it was only around 6:00 in evening, we were turned down. If they can allow children on other days, why not all days. Very disappointed.",Rated 1.0,6,0,??
Shaifali Aggarwal,"Rated One of the best places to hangout in DELHI. Located in the heart of delhi. The outdoor seating is super awesome.The cafe is situated in the middle of the cannaught place and you can actually have a view of the huge park if you sit outside. The interiors are like the name and resemble an underground vault with separate area created for private gatherings.. The whole ambience was really impressive.

Asmita Rai,"Rated The best part about the place is the ambience. You can sit at the terrace, the open restaurant or in vaults. The vaults give you privacy but a group of 10-12 people is required to take a vault. Food is good, pretty much like any other good restaurant. Service is a bit slow.

Kanak Khanna,Rated Perfect group place . If you are 10 in number you get your own vault . Vault is nicely decked up with wooden circular doors and comfortable couches . Menu is huge with lots of cuisines . I tried : 1. Vault special extra spicy chicken wings - saucy and not that spicy . Boiled chicken tossed in red sauce . Bland in the middle with chilli sauce on top . 2. Chilli chicken - spicy and tasty . Sort of similar to boombox chilly chicken . 3. Chicken shawarma- perfectly cooked Lebanese dish served with two dips . Rolls rolled in pita bread and served with hummus . 4. Dal tadka - spicy tadka on top . Tastes best with laccha parantha . 5. Mutton masala - spicy dish with boneless mutton . Loved the gravy and the mutton was perfectly cooked .,Rated 4.0,47,200,??

Prashant Bhaskar,"Rated First & best thing: Ambience of the place. All the things we ordered were really good (Smoked cheese balls,watermelon mocktail, thin crust paneer pizza, chicken peri peri pasta etc.) Service is really slow, they have some gadget on the tables for calling the waiters but at that time they were mere showpieces (not solving the purpose).

Nandita Sharma,"Rated It was one of closest friend's birthday and we choose this place because of its central location So starting with the ambience I would say the concept of dinning in a PRIVATE VAULT is very nice as you get a personal space to sit and have fun. We had ordered nachos,iced teas, white sauce creamy pasta, and tea along with a few more starters. On the whole the food was TASTY and the bill suprised us. So it is a full value for money",Rated 4.0,31,38,??

Prabhjot Singh Khurana,"Rated I was really looking forward to dining at the vault caf this evening with 2 other friends. But when we arrived there, we were told that stag entry wasn't allowed(we were 3 guys). You see, Under normal circumstances, that would have been totally okay. A caf has the right to have a policy and follow it. BUT - the problem is that just 15 minutes ago, I had called up at the caf where someone whose name starts with J and ends with P(don't wanna name him here) - and I clearly told him that we were 3 people coming and he gave me an affirmation. The problem is - during that phone call, I was NOT informed about the prohibition of stag entry. (I mean it doesn't take rocket science to understand that in a group of 3 people - one person is BOUND to be single under all cases !) Nevertheless, he didn't care about getting any details from me or informing me about the above mentioned policy. Therefore, we walked for 15 minutes(in anticipation of a good experience and building our appetites) up till caf vault - and as it appeared - it was ALL FOR NOTHING!! I'm heavily disappointed by the communication problem and my experience at the entry point. I don't care anymore how good/bad the caf is - and I'll probably never find out because I'm NEVER going back there! But you know I'm pretty happy that happened. It's a blessing in disguise. We ended up going to A MUCH NICER PLACE WITH MUCH NICER PEOPLE. We had a good time having scrumptious Lebanese cuisine in a hospitable environment at Zizo, CP. Dear guys at vault caf - I respect your policies. But I'm sorry to say you upset me today. You could've at least made an exception for us today because of the miscommunication. On the contrary, the guy on phone(when I contacted him again at the entry) had to audacity to say that it's I who was supposed to enquire about all the little details and info. Like d'uh - am I supposed to ask you to read me your terms and conditions before I reserve ? So - all in all - even without having entered the caf - I felt highly unwelcome and annoyed. So there goes vault caf chucked out of my foodie bucket list!!!",Rated 1.0,1,0,??
Sai Praneeth Macherla,"Rated The Vault Cafe is a really great place to hangout. I was here when I visited Delhi and I fell in love with it, the minute I saw the door of the entrance that looks like a vault. The ambience is really nice and it also has outdoor seating, which I think is only open in the night. The food was really delicious and the staff was very helpful in helping us pick the right dishes. I would definitely head back to Vault the next time I'm in Delhi.",Rated 4.0,30,133,??

Adit Sharda,"Rated Nice bubbly place to go to! The food good, not great, the DJ is good at mixing and the place serves good hukkahs. The interiors are slightly dim so photography is an issue, but a dim ambience is what most Delhiites look for and what they get. Given the stiff competition around CP though, this place falls short of a lot of its competitors, but that doesn't mean that the place isn't buzzing with people. You'll normally find yourself waiting to get a table here, sometimes for almost 45 minutes, and that's a good sign for a place to be rated well.",Rated 3.5,14,121,??

Sarath,"Rated A good chap named Surender catered to our needs today. Even though he did miss out on few courteous gestures that the staff should definitely address, his humble nature kept the bar on the smoother side of things. My wife and me, just the 2 of us for a quiet lunch, but wasn't that quiet I must admit. Noisy and full of loud music as most cafes and restaurants have become these days and ambience was a little too much on the darker side. I am guessing that is the decision of the management to cater to the hippy and sheesha customers, as i'm sure they would love it. We booked a vault room at the restaurant through telephonic booking but when we reached there were no vaults available and they also said vaults are not given to couples. You need to go with a group of 5,6 or 7 to enjoy the closed chambers, something that they missed telling me when taking the booking reservation over the phone. But honestly, in the end all that matters is the food which was quite good and filling for the amount that I paid. The details of the food that we had has been posted as pic along with this review.

We had reserved a table a-priory so had the seat right in front of the humongous screen. Ordered a brainfreezer sheesha, pasta alfredo, four cheese pizza, fries, hazelnut shake, vanilla-banana shake and a cappuccino. Each and everything on the table was perfect. Service was amazing too.

Palak Chhabra,"Rated Vault is centrally located in CP and hence is a very convenient place to hang out. It's vault like interiors are definitely catching - if not particularly pretty. However they also have semi - private vaults inside the restaurant which can be booked for small gatherings with relative privacy. A drink that I ordered is worth mentioning. It was a special on that day. A coffee - orange juice mocktail sounded very different and tasted even better! I was apprehensive how the different flavours would pan out, but the drink was brilliant. highly recommend. I ordered the lemon -mint chicken which was an excellent dish. Next I ordered the barbecue chicken strips - and I wasn't that happy with them. If not dipped in the BBQ sauce , they were quote bland in themselves. Miss. Overall I give it 4 stars for the quality of drinks and food. I'm not a fan of the interiors (even though it's their USP). It's too overpowering and almost suffocating for me , personally. However it's very much worth the money.",Rated 4.0,7,58,??

DC,"Rated Vault Cafe is a good option to go anytime of the day be it for lunch, brunch or late evening hangouts. This is a go-to place that is convenient, spacious, and provides good cuisine options at a reasonable price. Ive visited here quite a few times already. Their menu is abundant and offers a variety of sandwiches, omelettes and burgers. I find the salads at this place quite refreshing. I also recommend you to try out their dumplings, BBQ chicken Strips, Mint & Lemon chicken for starters. The place serves very good sangrias, and the Bar menu is also quite extensive to choose from. Service is decent, mostly the staff is always busy attending one or the other customer. Once your order is placed it might take some time for the serving but the food is served hot and fresh. Ambience of the place is good, cheerful and youngish. Interiors are nice with mixed variety of chairs, sofas and youll be lucky if you get to choose your seat as the place is quite packed in the evening. Overall a nice changeover place and a must to be in your routine hangout bars in the area.",Rated 3.5,40,332,??
FOODSTER,"Rated Vault cafe created a lot of buzz when it opened and since then this place is much talked about as it is certainly not a quiet place. Its alive and kicking and caters to young party lovers. You get an idea of how much thought and effort have been infused to come up with a place like this when you visit.. A heavy metal door has to be opened with a lot of effort to get in . The interiors are very well done, a domed shape chamber look has been given to the place with dim yet beautifully lit spacious area. There is a long bar in one corner which is highlighted with vibrant yellow lighting and a deejay console in the middle. I simply loved the idea of four to five tunnel shaped chambers with a sitting capacity of 10 to 12 people which are kind of seperated from the main hall with rustic looking round shaped doors. Also is an outdoor sitting area with a great view and usually remains packed most of the time.A table reservation to the outdoor sitting is recommended. The food and drinks menu are varied with best of all the cuisines. I usually start of in a simple way of ordering whiskey but experimented with drinks to order a cocktail called Vault no. 1857, a vodka based drink with cardamom and vanilla flavour topped with pineapple juice which was excellent, Also i simply loved the way it was presented. It was a great start. Later ordered a long island iced tea which was traditional and good , and a vault red bull which was a bit sweeter. I usually dont have much expectations from the food in places like these where the focus is more on ambiance, drinks and music , but the food did impress . Starting off with Schumak Spiced grilled chicken with humus , tzaziki sauce , and pita as accompaniments. The chicken was spicy yet balanced . The humus and tzaziki were of perfect consistency. The lettuce and orange salad which was a great combination of citrus orange and crispy lettuce with vinaigrette dressing. The next in line were the celery and mushroom dimsums served with soy sauce and green onion vinegar was outstanding. The veg pepper salt i thought was a bit soggy and could have been better. The soup of the day was the veg clear soup which had a homely taste had a good portion size and was simply presented. Grilled chicken with mushroom and pepper sauce was our only order from the main course section which was par excellent. Served on a bed of mashed potatoes with buttered summer veggies topped with a rich brown sauce was a feast. Presentation and the portion size was perfect. The brownie and ice cream and the tiramisu made a great ending to our meal. We left with a smile on our face and a promise with ourselves to repeat our visit.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Dudeandthefood,"Rated The best part about the cafe is the terrace sitting that it offers. It gives you an amazing view of the tri color fluttering constantly. Good enough to arouse a lot of patriotism in you esp once you gulp down a few beers. You tend to enjoy ur time there watching the hustle bustle of traffic at connaught place. They could have made the experience better with good food. I ordered Penne Arabiatta and a pesto sauce pasta. Found them quite ordinary. The most disappointing was the Nachos with cheese. I wonder if the dish was supoosed to be nachos with cheese or cheese with nachos. Excessive and too sticky the cheese was. As far as the drinks are concerned the Sangria pitcher is a value for money for the Sangria lovers. I would recommend you to visit this place on a late winter afternoon to enjoy your drinks.

You just cant talk in that cacophony. Food is just too bad - 1) portions are too small compared to all other restaurants. 2) taste is most mediocre, nothing like you would expect from a restaurant of this class. For Eg., our soya champ had excess salt. There was no mint sauce on offer. The onions were soggy. Rotis had maida in it instead of being made of whole wheat. A corona costs about 465 + taxes & Ultra costs 200 + taxes. That should give you an idea about the cost of a meal here. Loos are too cramped, both men & women.

Also, we had to ask for tissue papers. So, our order contained bbq chicken pizza, spicy peri peri chicken pasta and watermelon and kaffir lemonade. The pizza was not good, it was bland in taste. The pasta was good though, it was tangy rather than spicy. The lemonade was not worth it, tasted very artificial. Overall, it was a very okayish experience.

Shyamaj Bajpai,"Rated Have already been to the place 2 times in the last 15 days. The have a wide variety of food options. I mean seriously you will get confused as to what to order. The bar doesn't have have all the liquor they have proudly put on the menu. Both times I visited they didn't have what I asked for even though it was listed on the menu. Service is very very good. I wanted to give them 4.5 but Still I am giving them 2.0 rating because last time I went there with my friends STRANGELY they denied me a last LiiT pitcher(before this last order my bill had already crossed 14K). They said you have to order food to get that(this was a manager I am talking about with our waiter) When I asked him why the hell??? They couldn't give me an answer,they just said I have to. I had to give the waiter a 1000 Rs bribe to get me that pitcher. After that he brought me not one but two pitchers (ofcourse not free) . It never happened to me ever in any lounge, restaurant or bar. I was very disappointed by this behaviour of them. I can only think of one explanation that they must have thought that we were very high on booze. But the thing is I wasn't even drinking. And they were adamant on not serving anymore alcohol unless we order more food???? I couldn't understand this concept. But still I would say if this thing doesn't happen to you, this will be one of the best places to hang out with your friends.

We visited on a Tuesday and it was more than 50% full and people were coming in still. Location is good and they have valet for busy days. Seating is ample and comfortable but booking is recommended for weekends. They also have separate sections for private parties and open terrace but I thought the private sections looked a bit packed. Our order: 1) Thai spring rolls - Crunchy, good flavour and Spice and came with a matching dip. 2) Chilli paneer - The paneer was tossed in the wok so wasn't as soft as at some other places. But definitely packed a taste punch. 3) Four seasons pizza - Again very good. Thin and hand tossed. 4) Pasta primavera - I didn't have it but everyone loved it. The garlic bread was so good we ordered an extra portion. 5) Virgin mojito - Reasonably good.

The balcony area too was really good. We ordered a veg pasta, Prawns, Chilly chicken, chicken nuggets, cheeseballs, chilly patato & some fries etc. The food was really good only the prices are a little bit high but worth it, totally.

Coming to the ambiance, good ambiance owing to location and cafe tag, the staffs are quite busy but good. Barbeque chicken, White Sauce Pasta, Peri peri chicken were all good, mojito being good too. Fir enthralling youngsters a must visit place. What disappointed me the most, is the staff at the entrance who was enquiring about who and why will enter the place! He took a top bottom scan of me and asked few questions before letting me in as if i am in an interview. At the same time, a lady dressed in some skimpy attire and a grabing hold of a hunky dude with sleek hairstyle went by unquestioned. This shows the poor mentality of the staff standing outside and may be management should check such approach for such a reputed place when you say to promote equality :)",Rated 2.5,46,90,??
Ritvik Rehani,Rated I heard alot about this place from my friend. But it didnt went upto my expectations. I will not say it as a special place. Costing wise also it's on a much higher side. It costed us around 2700 for four w/o alcohol and hookah. The food was also ok. The only think that i liked was interiors.,Rated 3.0,4,1,??
Rhea Gupta,"Rated Have visited vault 3-4 times and love the food and the outdoor seating here. Went with my family last night for dinner and sat outside in the lovely weather with the vision of our flag standing tall and swaying with the wind. We ordered our drinks- Sangria, Mojito and a bucket of beers - undoubtedly all of them were extremely well made and refreshing. For food we went on to order - Caesar salad, which was topped with delicious dressings and crunchy lettuce, galauti kebab with small pita bread sized malabar paranthas, the kebabs legit dissolved as soon as I took a bite, they were soft and heavenly. We went on to order a veg pizza (don't remember which one exactly) but it was thin crust and tasted absolutely delicious and tandoori Chicken which was really good, too! As we were so full with all these appetisers, for main course we just ordered dal makhani and garlic naan which was amazingly good. Definitely going back to vault every now and then just for their great food and ambience.",Rated 4.0,19,274,??
Eat Style Shop,"Rated If you like draught beer, you might want to hit this place up and drink a barrel full without emptying your wallet. That's the only thing I look forward to! The jarring red lights, and the seating arrangement isn't one of favourite. The area is huge and there's room to accommodate the increasing crowd. On a saturday night, this place is no less than a club with loud music, college-goers and a big groups of people having parties. The 'vault' section of the restaurant is good enough for 10-15 people to have a private party with closed doors, which is the coolest bit according to me. The food isn't the best you can get in the money spent, and I wouldn't recommend you to eat a lot. Drinking and nibbling some fries and starters should be good. We ordered the chilly chicken, onion rings and fries- all were okayish. The chicken was undercooked, the onion rings had too much flour stuck to them and weren't cooked through. The fries- well, how wrong can you go with them? I had Sangria by the glass, and the alcohol content in the drink was quite balanced. It happened to be one of the few places where I think the drink was made after keeping it overnight/ atleast for a few hours. We also had the Kingfisher draught beer tower which was well priced. The music, ambiance and so-so food makes me not want to go back to this place, but on a rare day, I guess it shouldn't be so bad. We paid around 3000 for everything, which I thought, wasn't that bad for the amount we ordered",Rated 3.0,20,5,??

Shahrukh Habib,"Rated Located in F-Block opposite to Paliza Bazar, Vault Cafe has indeed differentiated itself from the masses in CP. They have used a simple concept of Vault and used it to the restaurant a mesmering theme. The entry of the cafe having a huge Vault door will itself raise your expectations and trust me it doesn't dissapoint you. You enter into a dimly lit restaurant with thematic lighting and thumping music. The interiors boast of sleek couches,comfy chairs, old heritage clocks and treasure boxes will give you a feel as if you have arrived to secret location The seating arrangements are divided into three parts: 1. Private Vault Chambers (For larger groups or Advance Bookings) 2. Indoor Lounge Seating 3. Outdoor Terrace Seating The Food and the Menu was pretty much similar to some of the other restaurants like Cafe Public Connection, Boombox, Warehouse Cafe.

It can easily accommodate more than 100 guests at a time. They have a very vast menu offering world cuisines like North Indian including wide variety of street food and paranthas also, Mediterranean, Asian and Continental as well. You name it and they have it kinds. A beautiful bar is also there decked up with all sort of poisons. The ambiance is dim lit and the soft music playing in the background gives you a comfort feel . There is an array of different flavours of Sheesha for the sheesha lovers.The staff and the service is quite efficient and effective ,the servers taking orders are very well versed with their menu which is quite impressive. When it comes to food they have a plethora of flavours to choose from, so here are the few of them which are the Chef Specials too and are must try as well. 1. Mix Green and Orange Salad. A very refreshing and colourful salad having goodness of salad greens and orange cuts tossed in mayonnaise based salad dressing. 2. BBQ Chicken strips.

A very tender fish preparation where the fish pieces are marinated and then roasted and cooked. 6. Prawn fresh chillies. It is a very much recommended starter for the sea food lovers for sure where the prawns are grilled to perfection having aroma of spices. 7. Veg Phad Thai. It is a Thai staple , basically stir fried rice glass noodles tossed in tangy tamarind sauce. It is popular on the streets of Thailand. 8. Veg. Quesadilla. It is a renowned Mexican dish where the tortillas are stuffed with the vegetable made stuffing and cheese and are served with salsa, sour cream and pico de gallo. 9. Chicken winglets with candied lemon. An extremely well presented dish where the chicken is properly cooked with the herbs and spices and are served with lemon slices. It's taste is a bit tangy but worth a try. 10. Shredded lamb sriracha sauce. A meaty preparation where the lamb shreds are cooked in Chinese style hot sauce. It goes very well with the steamed rice. 11. Veg. Mediterranean Platter. This is a wholesome meal in itself presented on a single platter, comprising of falafel,hummus,chickpea and potato fingers, tabbouleh, tzatziki, olives,pickled vegetables and pita bread. 12.

So 4pm we decided to meet but then later I got call from her she can't step out of airport due to boarding issues. Phew I had dressed and was ready to step out. I didn't let my spirits down and planned to go CP with wifey. A leisure walk in inner circle and came across vault cafe. It was around 6:45 pm and I asked table for two. We were told to take lift to 2nf floor. We easily got table and could see mostly young couples sitting having beer n Sheesha. They have special sitting area for group with the door in shape of vaults, one group was having casual business meet! They have small sitting area in open too, I could see few Indian couples n group of foreigners sitting in open. I ordered beer n non-veg crispy platter. I do not know what's wrong with CP caffe these days they do not have most beer listed in menu. Since I was on tight budget(visited 3 diff cafe in a week) I ordered kingfisher ultra to save some bucks but they only had 1 videshi pint costing rs.390(taxes extra). Waiter gave me option of ordering 6 to avail discount. Leave alone KF ultra atleast they should have kept videshi listed brands in case any one likes. Finally I ordered normal kingfisher pint(only Indian beer available). Crispy platter was so so you need to eat fast else it becomes hard as its fried. Platter had fish fingers, crispy chicken n lamb spring rolls. Lamp spring rolls had lot of cheese. I would say strictly avoid crispy platter if you do not want to have fried snacks. Overall felt like place is a average and there are more cafe in CP better than this. People preferring Sheesha/hookahs can try this.

Thus ensuring that people not going to the restaurant don't use their valet services. The place was very dimly lit and thus can't really comment on the decor. The outdoor seating had a waiting but once we got a table outside, it's a pleasant place to be. The music was terribly loud inside. The service was nice and pleasant.

Nikita Juyal,"Rated This place is spacious enough to not look crowded even when its housefull. It literally has 4-5 vaults which can accomodate big groups of people (8-10+ i am guessing). These vaults seem a little secluded from the regular area so its perfect for those who would like to have a semi-private kinda party. It also has an open terrace. We were seated right next to the DJ, which reminds me- DJ last night(saturday night) was playing old songs (7-8 years old songs!) and was taking requests but not playing any. :S So that was a bit disappointing at first, but with a few drinks down the tummy, whats playing didn't matter ;) My friend had been there before and said that this was not the case when she came before and i would like to believe it. We were out on the floor dancing till 12.30-1 and thats when the cafe closes up. And by 'dance floor' i mean the space in front of the DJ and in between the seating areas- there's no separate dance floor. #FOOD - Tenderloin steak with Soya vegetables- which was a bit chewy but loved the mashed potatoes and veggies served with it, Crispy honey chilli potatoes with sesame- tastes good, Authentic Red Bean Burger- definitely recommended.

Plus we wanted to sit one of the volts which they said was reserved , and yet no one came for the next 2 hours when we sat outside . The staff was a little rude a waiter would come after calling them 2-3 times , they were confused when it came to who has to do what . Now let's come to the main part FOOD , we ordered caesar salad , spinach pesto pasta , dahi kabab and in the drinks we ordered fresh lime and Oreo banana shake . The food was good . The salad was crisp and flavoured well , the pasta was a little Blanch , the onions given with the dahi ke kabab were too salted and sour . The shake was home like , though I could not feel the taste of Oreo , it tasted like more of a banana shake. The best thing about this place is its hukka .

The interiors are lit in red which gives off a spooky look. The interior seating is pretty ordinary barring some private enclosure which make you feel as if you are actually in a vault. Went in a large group so ended up ordering a whole list of items off the menu. However would like to mention only the note worthy ones here and ofcourse the ones that didnt go down too well. Extra Spicy Chicken wings were super spicy but worth having a try. Hot n Sweet Cottage Cheese Fingers were quite good. The Herbivore Delight Pizza was truly a delight and was finished in a jiffy. The Shahi Jeer Murg Bhuna was the best of the lot. The Penne Aribiatta Veg Pasta was the worst i have ever had. Absolutely no flavour at all. The Veg Quesadilla too was a big let down. There is a wonderful terrace seating which i would recommend. Great view of the inner circle and the awe inspiring Indian flag fluttering in the wind. Better to take a table there i say. For drinks we ordered combo shots of scotch but rather than getting them in shot glasses they poured the entire amount in a beaker and handed it to us. Was a big pain pouring out the exact measure into individual glasses. Service was pretty slow and orders took a long time coming.With so many good options in and around CP i certainly dont think i would be coming back here.,Rated 3.5,151,295,??
Thefoodosaurus,"Rated We were recently invited to review the very famous 'Vault Cafe' by Umang Tewari whose other ventures in partnership also includes cafe OTB and Garam Dharam. Since the area for seating is colossal, you have an option of sitting in lounge area, open terrace area or their private vault area. We sat in the vault area to experience the feel of the private vault. They just don't call these vaults private because they are separate from the lounge area, but they make sure that you are not disturbed until and unless you want to. The use of gigantic couches and strong wooden tables gives a warm feel. Also machines to control temperature and a service buzzer adds an edge. The vintage industrial ambience lends itself to being a one of it's kind dining space. The rustic architecture with colonial influences live up to the theme of the era. Treated with distressed grunge finishes, the exposed iron bracing work creates an unusual ambience. Treatment such as big vault locks and neo-classical inspired furniture add to the hyper thematic7,000 sqft restaurant. Following are the dishes we were served with: 1) Spicy Chicken Lollipop. 2) CRISPY BROCCOLI CORN & MUSHROOM PEPPER SALT (fried and cooked in oriental style). 3) SPICY CHICKEN & GINGER DIMSUM. 4) SMOKED CHEESE BALLS (coated and deep fried served with mayo and bbq sauce). 5) TANDOORI SOYA CHAAP GARAM MASALA (stuffed with cottage cheese). 6) CRISPY ONION RINGS. 7) MIXED SEAFOOD DUMPLING. The dumplings are served with following five types of sauces: 1) BLACK BEAN SAUCE. 2) SPRING ONION SAUCE. 3) TOMATO CHILLI SAUCE. 4) CHILLI SAUCE. 5) CHILLI PERT. We ordered the following for drinks: 1) SANGRIA 2) BEER (KINGFISHER ULTRA). We also tried their signature sheesha: 1) THE LED SHEESHA. 2) THE AK-47 SHEESHA. We tried a slice of their famous chocolate cake for desserts. The place is a must visit and excels in everything, from food to ambience to management to staff to the overall experience.",Rated 4.5,22,63,??

Kanika Patoria,"Rated Heard much about this place and paid a visit to see the proof. The entrance to this cafe looks like a huge golden safe. Push it and you find a red lit ambience making it a picture perfect environment. The food, we tried Amritsari fish tikka and the non veg tandoori platter. The food was average. Amount drinks, we took a Cuba Limbre with hazelnut and mint which was a perfect blend of cola and rum. And the Fruit Bull was too fruity. The ambience gets a 4 on 5. The red window making it unique.

Though he wanted to try other lounge which is nearby but i insisted that We must visit Vault Cafe. On entering we saw there wasn't much crowd so we thought the service will be satisfactory but contrary it wasn't. We ordered Hookah- mint flavour and it took them 45 minutes to being the same. Being the Hookah lover I am, I was expecting more. They didn't make it properly and I complained the same to the staff. Instead of doing something about it the staff told me very conveniently ' mam you do not know how to smoke ' Wow! That's that!

Yukthi Aggarwal,"Rated Another overrated place on the charts that I had the displeasure of ending up. I wanted to go somewhere else but it had a private party going on. So we left to only ending up at this cafe. There's nothing really exceptional about this place except may be the buzz surrounding the place. The crowd was mixed not so elite and good (ps I even saw a pandit there :p). You will find aunts trying to dress up as going to a prom guys trying to show the typical snobby 'Mera Baap kaun hai attitude'. You will see small kids through the rings of smoke and glasses of beer (really parents). The staff is clueless unprofessional n start warts who didn't even know whether pad Thai is on the menu or not. So basically just one person in the staff was 'concerned' to update himself with the menu. The hookah maker dropped coal on a friend and she got burnt n by the time we left they were still thinking whether to provide first aid or not. Drinks were the only thing up to the mark like the Bira and Baileys we ordered. Pad Thai was good if we didn't know how it really tastes like. Cheese and corn samosets okay again. The tomato pasta was spicy for everyone but for me it was sweet, sugary sweet. The best were the French fries. Can't comment on the non vegetarian dishes ordered by my fellows since I am a veggie. To conclude my friends I will call it a 'duh-uh' place.",Rated 2.5,20,35,??

The ambiance is pretty good. The decorations were cute than scary. But this place is certainly happening, both in terms of crowd and music. The food is okay. There was nothing very good or great about the food. This place is more of a place to hang out with friends over drinks and hookah. I, however, liked the all veg pizza because of its crust and fresh veggies. The service is good enough. Given the amount of crowd they had, they still managed to serve us well. Though the struggle to get a table for 4 for pretty overwhelming but given the good experience, I can forego that! Two hookahs, loads of drinks and some food for 4 cost us around 10 grands.

Although I did met the manager and complained about the same and he even tried to make up for it by offering pasrtry as birthday gesture. However, once the image destroyed it's destroyed. Food-3 service-2 staff-1. Poor handling of their guests. We even told the server within few minutes that if we are not getting good service we are walking off which wasn't taken too seriously.

I had to call the guys and half of them showed attitude af bcz they were so called ""sheesha"" guys. They dont pick dishes or even have the brains to tell us to call someone else!

Mayank Goyal,"Rated It was my birthday party! The long stairs ended at a big door similar to door on the vault and it was splendid..I was already in love with this place.. We were greeted by a staff member who escorted us to our seats!the place has 7 vaults,out of which one is a bit claustrophobic but others are amazing to the core! We ordered pan rasna flavored hookah,falafal wraps,smoked cheese balls,three cheese pizza,the vault fruit bull and cheesy spring rolls! Being a hookah buff, one has to try the hookah here! I was so ecstatic just at the first puff!do try d pan flavor! Falafel wraps were nice,nothing very extraordinary but yes decent enough! Now if u r going to vault,cheese balls is another thing which is a must try!perfect flavour,taste and even the presentation! Cheesy spring rolls were a delight to our taste buds..they came out to b an exception! The quantity seemed less but taste wise,splendid! The fruit bull was again a good item on their menu! The staff was cordial, attentive and knew what was there in the menu..The service was quick and nicely presented!moreover the pricing is also very decent!whatever they provide you with is actually worth it! The ambience took our breaths away!a dim red light,light music and very ordered seating! This is a must try place!

Madhav Gaba,Rated Vault cafe has disappointed me with their service as well as their drinks.we visited this cafe on a Saturday night and it was over crowded like all other cafes in the surrounding area.THe servers had no clue about what we ordered and had to remind them 3 to 4 times for our order.THeir food was also not that great if we compare it with other places in cp.AFter spending 7k bucks for 4 people you expect some decent food and drinks but was disappointed with this place.,Rated 2.5,19,61,??

Sheena_Siddharth,"Rated Review # 100. Visit dated 23 September, 2015. Dinners are best when they introduce you to new and amazing themed places.. Was invited to a get together at this place on a Wednesday night.. I arrived at 10 pm and the parking was a mad chaos.. The valet guys weren't doing a great job and hence the whole lane was chaotic.. The valet concept was to pay 100 bucks in the parking lot and later get it redeemed from your bill.. Seriously, I haven't seen this earlier.. The lift took me to the floor where this place is and the theme began from there.. A huge vault like door opened and the vault-ness began.. Dimly lit, the entire place was buzzing with people contrary to my expectations from a Wednesday night at 10 pm.. The crowd oozed the Delhi class and air was filled with Hukkah smoke.. The seating is bifurcated into main area, personalised vault area and the outdoor seating.. I was lucky enough to experience each of these sittings that night due to the large group I was a part of.. We started with the LIIT pitcher, which was recommended to us by the guy attending us.. When it came, our jaw literally dropped!! Guys, you have to try it to believe it... The LIIT came in a wooden trunk full of nitrogen ice.. We couldn't believe what we were witnessing.. Once the nitrogen ice smoke simmered down we could see our drink.. (Please check our pictures for reference).. The other drinks, shots were the usual.. Coming to food, we ordered a variety from the menu but everything tasted average.. The place has focused on the innovation bit, however, seems like food hasn't been given much thought.. The outdoor seating is beautiful with scenic view of our Indian flag and other Connought place hustle bustle.. But what stood out was the personalised vault seating.. We were around 15 people, so we were given our own private vault with our own personnel attendant.. Smoking was allowed inside the personal vault, which saved us a lot of trouble of stepping outdoors in heat for catching a puff.. The personalised vault had ample space, which we used as our personal dancing area for a complete personal party experience.. Positives: The innovative LIIT, personalised vault area, outdoor seating, crowd, theme.. Negatives: Slow service, Music sucked (on Wednesday night.. cant say about other nights), average tasting food.. Verdict: To be tried for sure for the uniqueness that this place offers!!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Amit Chauhan,"Rated Recently visited this much hyped Vault Cafe located in CP. As me and friends were catching up only for drinks on a sunday my review will only be based on drinks, snack food and experience. Frankly speaking I really liked this place as they offered good variety of food and drinks options priced at competitive rates. Though we had small issues but the staff was courteous & spontaneous enough to instantly act on it. They also have the concept of vault rooms (as the name suggests ) available to host private parties of 15-30 people depending upon the size of the reserved room, which I really liked. Concluding my review I would rate this place a 4 for the overall experience ranging from food, drinks and service.",Rated 4.0,30,631,??
Sumanth Behara,"Rated Found this place on zomato while we were around CP, its was rated high and had decent reviews. The big vault door was really impressive as soon as we got out of the elevator. Strangely we weren't greeted by anyone when we entered, we had to find the manager and asked for a table. The staff were running around and took quite a while to attend to us. The interiors were grunge and had a very reddish ambience to the place. Nevertheless the food was brilliant. Overall it was a decent experience.

Sumeet Arora,"Rated Went to Vault today with my office colleagues. Had read good reviews of the place so decided to try it. Here are my views- Ambience - Nothing great to talk about. The red lighting looked out of place. Though I liked the concept of the private vault's where 10 odd people can have a private party. Music levels in the private vaults was high though with no provision of lowering the volume. Air conditioning was not effective inside the Vault room. Outside was still better. Staff - Attentive but no smile on their faces. The person standing at the entrance below didn't even bother to greet or show the way up. Food - We had ordered Chilli Chicken, Chilli Paneer, Veg Salt & Pepper, Honey chilli potatoes, Veg Pizza, Lemon and garlic Chicken, Fish Fingers. Nothing was tasty. The Chinese snacks seemed like made of the same paste/gravy with chicken/paneer/potatoes added in them. Tandoor wasn't working at the time we went so couldn't try the tandoori dishes and can't comment on those. Only thing worth eating were the fish fingers. Drinks - had ordered White wine Sangria(2 glasses and the taste of both was different), Red Sangria was fine but apples in it looked stale. The menu had a long list of beer but only 2 were available. Our party got spoilt further when few small cockroaches also joined in on the table to enjoy the food. The manager just gave an excuse that the pest control is done but surely didn't have any effect on the cockroaches. We were offered 10% discount but what's the point ! We definitely are not coming here again and would not recommend the place to anyone else also. There are much better places in CP to enjoy drinks and good food.",Rated 1.0,2,0,??
Mamta,"Rated Seeing the awsome pics on zomato and facebook, me and my friends decided to go to The Vault Cafe.

Firstly they didn't give me a vault and later on asking the couch sitting they denied for the same as well there itself my mood get spoiled on my birthday! After so much arguing they gave me couch sitting but reduced their effort in service and there was one guy named *Nizam* who was attending my tabledidn't even bothered to play a birthday song on special request, gave a weird look as if we asked his gf for a date. Then i ordered starters and after that ordered main course but he brought main course first saying that you have ordered it first. How someone could bring main course first rather than bringing starters first?? After this incident he took the main course by saying that bread won't get change and he served the same breads. Then we called another waiter he replaced that bread with fresh ones. My experience with the place was verydisappointing and will never visit it again! Thus rating it very low.!",Rated 3.0,5,1,??

Ankit Das,"Rated My friends and I had so much fun when we last visited this caf. Full marks I give for its unique design and layout. As we entered the precincts of it, we saw several vaults and it looked more like a harry potter movie design. We literally had our beverages sitting inside the vault and it was a thrilling experience in itself. They offer a wide variety of mocktails, cocktails, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, of which some of our favorites were jose cuervo gold taquilla and caffe latte. Just visit to go high and get locked in the desired vault.*wink*",Rated 4.0,23,203,??
Anirudh Khanna,"Rated The unexpected factor for me about this place was the ambience - it looks more like a sheesha bar with the red lighting and the low tables and sofas. As much as I had heard about the place, the food lived up to the expectations. We ordered a few beers, an LIIT(which was moderately strong), crispy honey chicken, bacon wrapped chicken fingers, grilled chicken in mushroom sauce, fish n' chips, and lamb galouti kabab. Except the fish n chips(which was slightly bland) and the grilled chicken ( which had a bit too much of salt) , everything else was great. The galouti kabab definitely stood out for me. The meat was succulent, juicy, tender and went amazingly well with the tawa parantha. I didn't expect this good a galouti kabab out of a mere restro bar that doesn't specialise in a particular cuisine. The prices aren't low but it all seems worth it in the end.

The food was good.We ordered smoked cheese balls which were amazing.They were full of cheese and served with two dips one barbecue and other was some cheesy dip.I must say that the balls were too good and the cheesy dip was out of the world i never had a better cheesy dip than this.I simply loved it Next we had mix sauce pasta,again it was yummy though lacked basic veggies but no flaw in the sauce.The sauce was amazing and the pasta was cooked to perfection.The only led down was that they don't serve the food and didn't provide the apt cutlery i mean how can you serve the pasta just using a fork. Lastly we ordered 4 cheese pizza.Now this was disappointing though the crust was thin and crisp but the flavours of cheese were not geling up together.Maybe we made a wrong choice but anyhow the pizza wasn't good So out of the 3 dishes two were a hit and one was a miss but all in all the place is nice not that expensive and the portions are also good.Surely worth trying !!",Rated 3.5,23,59,??

It serves as a perfect place where you can spend your weekend / week days (if you're lucky ;p) without burning a big hole in your pocket. I have been visiting this place for quite sometime now and I noticed that while the service standards have really gone up and so has the cleanliness, the quality and quantity of the food ( especially non vegetarian) has gone down miserably from the time they started operating.

Now having so many inhibitions in my mind, I gave this particular place a try. And I was easily taken by its ambience and the amount of space it covers which I suppose very few places in CP would possess. The place is pretty spacious and posseses some private vaults too which appeared good. The cleanliness of the place, which is hardly talked about, is also something that I cant help but put light on. Also , amazing service by the staff. They were really courteous and polite. Sheesha was the show stealer. Couldnt' try drinks for it was a Dry Day! Boo you Gandhi ji.

Second, the Sufi night and Bollywood Night on Friday and Saturday respectively are pretty amazing too. The match screenings are pretty exciting too. Cons- The service is pretty bad here. They try to be a lot professional and the Managers are on constant round, the thing about them is they're not trained properly how to converse. Me, personally have reached into aliteration and arguments twice with them. Terrible service. The prices are pretty steep.

We were a bunch of four friends catching up after really long, and kept ordering different varieties of drinks one after the other. I think this caught the bartender's attention and he decided to give us a visit. He recommended some vanilla and peach flavoured shots, which were really smooth and tasted amazing.

Pallavi Jain,"Rated If you are going to Vault on a weekend evening, make sure you book a table or you are comfortable waiting. The cafe's private spaces designed as vaults werent available but they did look really cool places to chill. In case you are a group of 10-12 people do book yourself one of those before hand. We ordered a Veg Peri Peri Pasta, their Vault Special Extra Spicy Chicken Wings, Veg Spring Rolls and Nachos. The food portions were small. The pasta was nothing extraordinary but nonetheless tasted good. The non vegetarians loved the chicken wings! But the spring rolls were low on flavour and the spoiler with nachos was that the dish was served as chips and dips. I personally like the whole Jerk Nachos feel. Vault has a very chiller vibe but the staff did seem very disinterested. Friends who ordered alcohol had to settle with what was available because a lot of beer menu options weren't available. Those who love alcohol would not find this place expensive and they also serve you Shisha. The ambience is great and you can have a good time here. They can do a better job with food though!",Rated 3.5,21,80,??

I really want to give this place 5/5 but just because of slow response from staff i give them 4/5. And please change those metal seats it feels like seats of railway station.

Jigyasa Hasija,"Rated We went to the vault cafe for a friends see-off party. So it was supposed to be a special occassion and demanded a special place to be at. So we decided on the vault cafe, a new place in cp. As we entered the vault, we were pleased by what met our eye. The seating plan/ concept of having ""vaults"" in a restaurant is nice, but we were not allowed to seat ourselves in these vaults. The reason given by the waiter was that we need to come in a group of at least 15 people to enjoy the priviledge of being seated in the vault! (We were 7). We were then placed at a table near the balcony where the sun was directly hitting our eyes, making us squint at the menu. Our repeated requests to change our table fell on deaf ears as the waiters were too busy serving the privilidged customers sitting in 'the vaults'. We consoled ourselves with the thought that maybe the food would make up for this. We ordered chicken with potatoes, nachos, spaghetti, pasta and an LIT chest (all at the recommendation of the waiter). Alas! We were wrong as the food was probably one of the worst kinds one could have. It was cold, the nachos were soggy and the chicken was hard to chew. We had had enough of squinting inder the sun. You may be surprised at what you read next as i find it hard even for myself to believe- but me and my friends actually lifted our table and moved to another place! After eating little of what we had ordered, we planned on leaving. We complained to the manager, who apologized and bade us goodbye with a smile- without offering to compensate for our dreadful evening. Rs 6800 down the drain! If i could, i would probably give this place a -2, but zomato doesnt allow the same. Still waiting to be compensated.",Rated 1.0,39,15,??
Aayushi Gupta,Rated This is one of the most amazing cafe in CP. It's interiors and the ambiance makes it perfect to want to visit again.

Abhas Wadhwa,"Rated This place has a nice concept of vault for the interiors which makes it outstanding from others and its the best thing of the place. You will enjoy the nice ambience here and of-course service is very prompt. But for the food experience I would say there was less ups and more downs for us. Drinks menu seemed on paper only on our visit as whatever we asked wasn't available so finally we had to ask what could we get and ordered accordingly. Mocktails were also very limited, but thank god food covered all of this at the end. Starters: Cron and Cheese Samosets - to simplify its cheese samosa - 4.5/5 BBQ Chicken Strips - 4/5 Veg Spring rolls - 3.5/5 It should be more crispy Chicken winglets - 4/5 Dahi ke kebab - 3/5 I have had much better kebabs guys Fish Fingers - 4/5 nice taste Other: Vault special 5 spice grilled chicken breast - presentation makes you fall in love with this, all the elements were perfect in the dish loved this on - 5/5 Arrabiata penne chicken - 4/5 it was a another good one Veg Fajita - I don't know what it was but again presentation did the half work :) - 4/5 Hawaian Pizza - 3/5 nothing special about it To summarize it overall it was a nice experience but I have to say it wasn't because of the food. Ambience: 5/5 Service - 4.5/5 Food variety - 5/5 Drinks variety - 3.5/5 Quality - 4.5/5 Taste - 3.5/5 (needs some work on few things) Quantity - 3.5/5 Overall 3.5/5 But I would say its a must visit place in CP:)",Rated 3.5,40,136,??

Jayantika Sarwal,"Rated A 'time machine' seeming entry with a huge door to unlock leads you to the all red-y ambience of this place.. The best part about the place is the outside seating which comes as an absolute delight in evenings - watching the beautiful Connaught Place. The space is huge, sprawling over every corner you turn your head to. Music, red affects, crowded seats, hookah, comfortable couches, bar chairs.. Ah, what else can you think of. The whole place is very appealing and peppy.. The place appears to be kinda congested on weekends with people flooding on each table. Our order included : BEVERAGES 1. Watermelon Khafir Lemonade This one was indeed a refresher. Great combination of both , very soothing to the taste buds. Must try. 2. Virgin Mojito A typical, anywhere available version of the cliche drink. 3. Homemade Ginger Ale This one was kinda different from the usual ginger ale that I've been having since long. Was nice, but not the very authentic original one. MAIN COURSE 1. Corn and Cheese Samosets These tiny little Samosets filled with melting cheese and corn was an absolute delight. Served with 2 dips, salsa, and mayo. A good have one for all the vegetarians. 2. Spinach Fussili Alfredo Not very great but above average dish. The sauce wasn't perfectly cooked. Quite thick consistency,as compared to the usual. 3. Veg Spring Rolls 10 pieces of crispy spring rolls over a serving pan was an absolute delight to have. Amazingly cooked, this is a sure shot starter.. Other Parameters : MENU The menu was very elaborate. From oriental section to continental, to Mediterranean, to Italian, and finally North Indian - it covered major cuisines to offer which was a really appealing first impression of the place. SERVICE An honest take on it, the service was quite average. Probably it was a weekend, and there was tsunami of people all over the place. But hardly any attention was given to the customers. After we sat, the staff was to be called twice to take the order. They were memorising it, rather than jotting it down. Once the meal is given, no second attention to the customers was given which made it quite difficult for a person to order something again. Would've appreciated a lil more interaction with the customers for a better output of service. QUALITY OF FOOD And the main part, foooood! Right from the taste to the presentation, landing at the proportions and finally the value for money, I was fully satisfied. Quite appetising to the soul of a foodie, everything was great! In a nutshell, everything is good about this place, and a total value for money for the food and ambience being served. Hoping to have a get a great service the next time though.

Vishi Khandelwal - EnticingFoodCruise,"Rated Tapping on so much buzz around this place, visited the place with my friends last weekend. The long staircase led us to a door of a vault, which was surely the entrance to the place. There was nobody standing nearby the gate to welcome, which is strange to me. Anyways we entered to find one of the managers greeting us with a smiling face and offered us a table as we had our prior reservation. The whole place has a red color theme to it. They have done us the window panes of the place in red too, not striking but pleasing red which gives it a very distinct feel. One can easily see the sunlight going through the glasses and changing its spectrum. I personally was amused by the ambience and the whole feel to the place. The interiors were done up nicely and would make you travel to the British times. They have well thought of a private vault concept which they book for a group of 10 or more. They had chains on the roof and bars on the window to go smooth along their theme. One can find high chairs, couches and regular chairs and open air area to sit. We sat and was enjoying the music amidst deciding our food. This is when it started to get BAD. One of the managers walked up to me and asked us to leave the booked table and stand and wait near the counter before he could get us a table. I said politely that we already have a reservation done, so why am I being asked to move. His exact quite Sir, we have their prior booking and want this seat also they booked directly through us and you booked via an application. I very furious and fuming to hear this. A booking is a booking after all. One cant come up and ask me get up in the middle of my meal. I asked him to make us sit somewhere else but do not ask to stand up and wait. He was intelligent enough to gauge my anger and left away. The story does not end here, pathetic night it was. So we ordered drinks for all of us One Mango something shake, one mojito and I ordered chocolate hazelnut shake along with some spicy chicken and mix sauce pasta. My chocolate shake which I hoped to be wow going by the buzz, turned out to be an absolute dud. It was too sweet to have, so I asked to replace the shake. Our server very welcomingly took away the shake and bought another after 15 min, which was nothing but my old shake with more milk to it. It became unbearable now. I asked them to change the shake and get a new one and not act smart. Finally I got an average shake but after I was done with my entire meal and that too after blasting on the managers for the pathetic experience they are providing their customers. So got my shake after my meal which I ordered way before I thought about my meal. The food was average too, nothing great about them. Quick Words Prior booking a must, do not even try and think about their shakes, red dim lit place, good music. Rating only for the ambience and the concept. Horrible experience of hospitality. Thanks for spoiling my evening The Vault.",Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Vaibhav Sawhney,"Rated The only thing that was good about the place was the ambience, which the management probably thinks is enough to attract people and run the place successfully. But the service was terrible. Firstly, half an hour after ordering food, when the food didn't arrive, we enquired about the same from the waiter. To our surprise, he had no idea what we ordered, and brought the menu again to ask us what we had ordered. He then promised that the food will be on our table within five minutes. The food finally arrived after about twenty minutes. Secondly, when we complained about the sheesha, the server told us it was our fault - we ordered the wrong flavor. Then why the hell was it on the menu? And why couldn't he suggest that when we were ordering? Finally, the music was boring, something which I generally ignore at a restaurant. But here, it was so depressing that it caught my attention - or maybe I was already too irritated by the shitty service. I could see the DJ yawning at the turntables, and sometimes he was altogether missing. The food was not so good either. The Barbecue chicken strips were fried! And the quantity was too less, given the high prices.Also, in case you still decide to visit, avoid the cheese balls and the mushroom dimsums. 0.5 extra for the ambience. Otherwise the place is crap.",Rated 2.5,61,278,??

I was lucky enough to be the part of a group as we were able to get hold of one their VAULTS. Yeah! They literally have chambers built in form of vaults throughout the periphery of the restaurant. I strictly avoid alcohol and hence was limited to mock-tails. Try their ginger ale if you're like me. Try it! It would surely blow your mind away. Food was pretty amazing (as expected from a place like this). On the pricing part: we were 14 people and I remember counting at least 5-6 buckets of beer, along with a tower and innumerable number of snacks (on a Sunday evening). The total bill was of approx 14K, Yupp! A mere 14K for the fun and crazy 3 hours spent locked inside a vault. They have vaults, indoor dining area (wooden flooring, tastefully decorated) as well as pretty big outdoor terrace seating (with mist fans). Crowd is pretty good as well.

Especially in bar menu, all the budget friendly drinks were out of stock. This is kind of oversmartness of the owner, we wanted to order bucket of pints of Rs800 and we end up ordering LIIT pitcher of 1300. Evn in whiskey brands most of thm were not available.

Harry,"Rated Had very high expectations from this place before visiting here. This place has garnered rave reviews particularly for its ambiance. I got to visit this place for a friend's party. Entering this chamber of secrets through the vault themed door makes u feel connected with the name. Entering inside the cafe the ambiance takes over. Dim Lighting, Private spaces with vault like openings ( love this bit here. Kudos to the person behind this concept) coupled with good music and some good seating arrangements. The cafe didn't look cramped up except for some areas near the private vaults. We expected the cafe to be full and bingo we had to wait for some time to get a table. The cafe looked a bit mismanaged though. The manager refused to add us to a waiting list. There was no particular waiting area and everyone was standing in the middle of the cafe. Luckily we didn't have to wait much and got ourselves seated. For food we ordered Smoked Cheese Balls ( Now that's what a cheese ball should be. It was an overdose of cheese in the mouth) Pastas Red & White ( i feel they missed a trick here. They weren't very good or out of this world. There is a vault for improvement here) Sizzling Piri Piri Chicken ( This was one dish i heard a lot about and it didn't disappoint me a bit ) Butter Chicken Pizza ( just as it should be. Nice thin crust ,generous amount of cheese and some good buttery chicken) Chicken Piri Piri Pizza ( everything the same just a slight change in the flavor of topping ). We also ordered a Hookah ( Brain Freezer). Well it was tall to say the least , very tall actually and it was very smooth. All this was coupled with some drinks. Now the worst part of my visit. Their service was a NIGHTMARE. I ordered Chicken Piri Piri Pizza and Red Sauce Pasta and they served it to me after around 45 mins and that to after reminding the staff about it thrice. The service was lazy and i am not sure about my next visit here now. Loved the ambiance even the food was good if not the best but the service was a letdown big time.

The ferroro roche shake is really good and the quantity decent. The sangria was decent. The peri peri pasta was more like a red sauce pasta. I tried both and honestly enjoyed only the red sauce.

I have always pre booked a table or a private Vault after we had to wait at the bar for the good part of an hour to land a table for two on our first time here.Must do that if you are big group.It will also keep you on the server's radar. I have had immaculate service; every single time. DRINKS : The LIIT is a speciality here served dramatically in a tall glass with nitrogen vapors,mixed really well.The Daiquiris in various flavors are great too.I've also tried their Pina Coladas which are good but a mocktail made with watermelon and muddled kaffir lime ,topped with lemonade is truly outstanding. Must have if you want to feel refreshed. STARTERS:The Veg Spring Rolls are excellent-crisp,non greasy with a tasteful filling. The Wild Mushroom Bruschetta is yummy but you have to eat it while its still warm.The tandoori Soya Chap Garam Masala is fiery n flavorful with a hint of achaari taste.The Cheesy Spring Rolls are crisp to bite but melt in the mouth.Its a good idea to go in for platters if you have ample company- they are value for money and you can sample a variety of finger foods. Veg Mezze platter and Tandoori Trail non veg are highly recommended.Avoid their Crispy Platters as they are all deep fried and inedible if not consumed while still warm.The Vault also does great Dimsums- both veg n chicken options.The five dimsums are light and fresh n served with five different kinds of dips but are not exactly value for money. MAIN COURSE: I ve tried the Makhni Dal and Paneer Pasanda (served with two portions of Indian breads)Both have been delicious three out of five times.Can the Vault please be consistent with quality and taste of these staples of Indian cuisine? If they are able to,then these two can qualify as their signature dishes.The Veg Thai Green Curry was brilliant, though a little runny;wish they would serve sticky rice with it.Their Pastas need a drastic overhauling of recipes.Both the mixed sauce and Arabiatta were unappetizing n with only traces of olives n veggies. Despite some teething troubles, the Vault has become my go to place to have a great time with friends n family. May the good times last !!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Siddharth Michael Sudhakar,"Rated The vault caf is one of those places which everyone knows about and everyone has on their list. It is very famous and it has the right reasons to be famous. Located in the heart of Delhi Connaught place, it can be found very easily in F block middle circle. Winner of What is your poison? award , vault caf does live up to the fame. Ambiance The theme of the place is used in the name itself , small chambers made with vaults doors. All Doors made with vault handling. You feel like you are a member of a secret society while being present in the place. There is a rustic old charm to the interiors which has a time travelling effect. The music is loud but just loud enough that you can hear the other person in front of you while still swinging away to the music. A very large balcony which over sees the beautiful Connaught place and our pride The national flag. The place has huge space but it so popular you probably will have to wait for 10 15 minutes. Food The place is known for its drinks more , than the food. But the food does do a satisfactory job at its end. We ordered from every cuisine except Indian so the know the status of the item. First starter The vault special chicken dumplings which seemed stale to be honest because the covering of the dumpling shredded of the meat like the skin from a snake. The meat did not have a kick of chestnut as promised. Very ordinary for a dish named Special. The second starter was the Chicken winglets with candied lemons which were amazing!! The candied lemons just bring a whole new array of flavor to the palate and it is beautiful! The wings were perfectly cooked. The salad served was full of flavor and my favorite olives. One of the best Mediterranean dishes I have tried in Delhi. Main course we started with Chicken Quesadilla from the Mexican section. The dish was good if I was sitting in a Indian dhabha. All the flavors were too indianisied for a Mexican dish. The bread was too thick, the sour cream lacked that punch but the salsa was great. A good dish but one a Mexican one. For the last dish we tried was the Mint marinated pork chops with apple chutney and brown sauce. The only good thing about the dish was American cheddar mash served with the dish. The pork chops lacked flavor and were undercooked the meat was actually a little pink from the inside. It lacked all the flavors promised and I was looking forward to this dish a lot !! Huge disappointment. Drinks I usually do not make a separate section for the drinks but this place demands it ! Vault No 1857 which is a vodka based cocktail with vanilla, cardamom and pineapple juice is a beautiful drink. In the first sip you feel the cardamom over powering the drink but with each sip the drink grow on you and it is beautiful!! Jasmine and maple syrup whiskey reminds of you Canadian whiskey and it is very good. The LIIT is the best one I have had outside of my own kitchen. The caiprioshka is pretty amazing and it feels like it is built to perfection. The drinks were really were well made. Also served with dry ice (excitement level = 193284) Service A special shout out to the manager Abhishek and our Server Parveen. Both were amazing !! Both did such a fine work that writing about it does not do justice. They were present with open ears and were a good show altogether. In the end all I would say they need to bring their food game up and they would be amazing. On the pandameter 3***1/2",Rated 3.5,82,185,??

We ordered a special Vault LIIT, which was basically a giant treasure like box filled with LIIT and pieces of dry ice to give it a misty feel. I will highly recommended this drink to a group of friends. We ordered grilled chicken, dahi kebabs and nachos all decent in terms of portion size and taste.

The falafel was very tasty and the hummus pita were even better. (No complaints). They even didn't mind serving more hummus without any extra charge. Broccoli black olive chicken white sauce pasta. Just so perfect. Loved it! I wish they would have given an extra garlic bread :P. Chilli chicken pizza. A dieter's cheat day delight.

Priyanshu Kumar,"Rated One of the busiest and best cafe you will see at Connaught Place. The enterance itself clarifies about its name, a giant door giving you an impression of you entering into some kind of vault. The interiors are also designed, with a proper concept on the same. Ambience is great. The seating is really comfy. They have special vaults with comfortable sofas for people's celebration in large groups. Also known as private vaults. The concepts of these vaults are really nice. The place is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table/ vault if you haven't made a reservation. It has also has a outdoor seating and smoke-zone. The ambience is lively most of the times with good music & nice crowd. Red Sangria is nice. Chicken bbq strips, chicken cordon bleu, tenderloin steak, Mint & lemon chicken, grilled chicken breast are really nice and my personal favourites.Mai Tai & Caiprioshka with Kaffir lime cocktails ia really nice.

The place has a dark ambience those looking forward to a bright joint can either opt for the balcony outside, during the day the place is draped in red light coming through the coloured windows.

Rajat Handa,"Rated I've covered most of the restaurants in CP and i can say from experience that Vault Cafe is giving an absolute masterclass.... on how to offer pathetic service.I visited this restaurant on 24th August, 2015. Occasion- My colleague had gotten placed in his dream company. We thought that the best way to celebrate this would be by going out to one of the 'supposedly' best restaurants in Delhi. Little did we know that this decision would prove to be a catastrophic one in our life. The first thing a restaurant serves you is WATER. Not only were we not served water, the waiter didn't acknowledge our demand until we had to personally go over there and complain.We initially decided to order a couple of pizza's along with a few beers(kingfisher). On placing our order we were told that the restaurant serves pizza only after 8 and the beers that we wanted weren't available ; Only the ones priced above 600 were available. That eliminated almost 60% of the beer menu. Furthermore, this is the first time I've ever heard of this Pizza excuse(There was no mention of it on the menu card).The mood had already dampened by then, but we figured that having come all this way we should at-least eat something and therefore ordered a few dishes off the menu, ate them and left as quickly as we could. Ironically, this is one vault that robs you of Fun, Time and Money.",Rated 1.0,38,166,??

The place is really well done and I really liked the loom and feel. The seating was really comfy and it was really well done. The service isn't great. The staff's not good either. They're just there to pick their salaries and don't add any value to the place. Coming down to the food.. - We ordered the Spring Rolls which were good. Crispy and really nice stuffing. They were nothing to rave about, but were really well made. - The Chilli Potato were good too. Crispy and not with any excessive color and with good bit of bite to them. - The Chilli Paneer which isn't hard to get right, was also good. - The Dahi Kababs were alright. Could've been better with the balance of sweet and spicy. - The mixed sauce veg pasta isn't good. It just didn't taste well. The quantity of the veggies in the pasta also wasn't much. The sauce, the most important part in any pasta, wasn't done well. - The Soya Chaap dish was alright. The masala marinade on the Soya was good and it was roasted well. - The seekh kabab, however were dry. Really disappointed with the seekh Kababs. The cheese balls were really disappointing. Very salty and didn't have any distinguishing flavour/taste to them. They don't serve pizzas and the pitchers are only available in mocktails.

Chhavi Mittal,"Rated Think twice before you decide to visit this caf. I made one of the worst decisions when I decided to celebrate my birthday at this place where the staff do not have basic sense. After having made prior reservations for 10 people (confirmed booking) I was given a table that could accommodate only 7 people, rest of my guests were made to sit on a makeshift arrangement of metallic and uncomfortable chairs. Upon requesting for a bigger table, the manager made false promise of he'll join the nearby table as soon as it was cleared.. Alas! In the 4 hours I spent there the table 'never' got cleared even though the occupants changed multiple times... To make things worse, I was handed the bill without me asking for it, and while I was still placing orders and my guests still coming in.

Parul Dudhatra,"Rated I really really like the concept that went behind creating this restaurant. What a brilliant idea of creating a vault to sit it. They serve all kinds of food, liquor and even have a smoking room. They even serve sheesha. Which is amazing, of course. The food I ordered was some paneer snacks to go with beer. Since we had ordered 6 beers they served us those beers in a bucket. Loved that too. Value for money. Would definitely visit again.",Rated 3.0,20,144,??
Manish Chachra,Rated Decided to go out for a round of drinks and dinner with cousins and wifey. 1st impressions: pretty popular with all kinds of folks. So much so that we had to wait for a table for about 20-25 minutes. Seating: comfy high chairs and bar seats. Food: Passable at best. Nothing to write home about or get excited. Portion size on the smaller things in life. Drinks: don't go by the bar menu when it comes to beer. Hardly anything available except the popular brands. Did not try anything else coz I was driving. The ladies had Vodka and the popular IMFL brands like Smirnoff were not available. Only options available were Absolut/Finlandia etc. Service: I found it to be slow and almost non existent. I had to keep on hunting for the guy who was serving us coz he would just disappear and be gone for like 25-30 mins... Order fulfilment was also on the slower side of things in life. Music: a weird mix of hip-hop and punjabi and bollywood... Would I go there again? Maybe not. There are better places available in the market with better service and better fare than what they have.,Rated 3.0,4,63,??

Rohini Gauba,"Rated I won't hit around the bush with this one. This is the probably the best caf in CP and my personal favourite. Located in the N block, mini footsteps stickers on the floor guide you to the Malhotra building. A small lift which can accommodate only 4-5 people at a time takes you to the Vault Cafe. A huge metal door welcomes you to the red world. For people visiting in groups of 20+, they have huge vaults with plush leather coaches and king-sized chairs. The inside area is lit with small red lightings. They even have an outdoor seating-balcony area with sprinklers in every corner. Moving on to their food section, mint and lemon chicken is a must-have. Although, they have reduced their quantity by a fraction but this dish is worth every penny spent. Pizza's are hand tossed and large. Pasta's are equally good. The size of the glasses used for the cocktails and mocktails have also shortened and the price remains the same. This was disappointing! The service is bid slow as the place is always occupied. One has to wait for about 20-25 minutes before you get a corner for yourself at this concept-based cafe. Average cost for two would be around 1400-1500 bucks including taxes. For an ambiance as good as this, everybody agrees to shell out this amount. You always have a last resort in mind while hunting places in CP for a weekend scene, my option has always been the Vault Caf.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

As soon as u enter it u come to know y its called The Vault Cafe. Ambience : Pretty decent n nice but not out of the world. The balcony seating is pretty nice. Food : Most of the items are good barring some food items. You should try burritos. Service : Overall good but dey take a little bit long to serve the hookahs. Hookah : Pretty good. U get in ol shapes - AK-47, Eiffel tower. Drinks : This is the section they need to work on. Shakes were average.

Prarthna Wadhwa,"Rated We went to Vault Cafe for Lunch on a busy working day, and I have heard some excellent reviews of the place, however I want to differ here, I think their service was quite poor. We ordered one piri piri veg pasta which was definitely well made, el Dante, saucy and flavourful but I however don't think the serving sufficed. We also ordered exotic vegetables in a spicy Chinese sauce served with veg fried rice. The serving was again conservative I must say. But the dish was prepared nicely. Food wise while I would like to rate the place with a 4 ( 4.5 worthy food, but serving size made it lose 0.5 mark there) Service wise, not even 2. After we were done with our food we were sitting with the sheesha we had ordered. The server got us the bill on his own and kept standing there right in front of our table so he could make us conscious in purpose and we had no option but to pay. Whether or not we were in the mood to leave. I rate it so poorly because this kind of bad service is something I haven't seen in any restaurant so far. gourmetglamourandgala.blogspot.com",Rated 2.5,37,222,??
Harshita Birdi,"Rated The ambience here is so extravagant and unique. I love how they paid attention to little details in their decor. Basically they charge for all that. Food here is tasty, but like any other up beat popular caf, overpriced. We came here in a rush, on independence day, were obviously disheartened by the dry day. We ordered honey chili potatoes Which were a hit. Crisp and a perfect balance of sweet and chili. The drinks we ordered were chocolate hazelnut shake, again awesome, mango and strawberry smoothie, really really good. And lastly a tropical cooler which was a bit on the tart side. Maybe a hint of refreshing mint was missing. Might come here again, if I'm loaded with alot of cash on me.",Rated 4.0,22,202,??

Rohit Sen,Rated I had this place bookmarked in my mind and zomato profile for a long time and finally I did visit this cafe with a friend on a weekday afternoon. The vault theme which looks like an old dungeon is unique. The interior of the cafe with it's interesting name is well crafted and tastefully done. The place speaks for itself and one can imagine how it gained so much popularity despite being in business for just more than a year now. Though I would say the place is slightly over hyped. The drinks and food starters were nicely done and sumptuous. The portions were adequately ample as well. Though I would like to see more variety in mocktails. Cannot complain with the service which was bang on. I would say the pricing is moderate and provides value for the money you spent here. Vault Cafe also has outdoor seating available which I cannot think to use at most of the time of the year in Delhi apart from the fact that it gives a lovely view of CP and our national flag. Vault is located near Gate number 5 of metro station or some steps away from Boombox cafe. It is not hard to locate as most people have seen this place. But you have to negotiate a never ending staircase before entering here. All the time I spent there it was moderately crowded. They have special vaults with comfortable sofas for people in large groups. A recommended place to hang out with friends. Cheers!,Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Harish,"Rated Not worth the money. I virtually spend 25 to 30 hours in my CP office every week & I can say I have visited most of the cafes/ restaurants in CP. There are many places in CP which offer better experience than vault. The food sounds & looks way better on the menu than actually is. Mashroom galauti & tandoori soya chaap garam masala were pathetic.( soya was not even cooked properly) . The serving staff is good & offer a hearing at-least. The managers in suits who allocate table to the guests are inexperienced & definitely lack in hospitality skills. Overall , I would say there is definite need for prices to reduce, the quality of food must improve & staff has to become more hospitable.",Rated 2.5,1,0,??

The shake and Nachos taste awesome , no doubt in that but the Peri Peri pasta and fajita taste crap. The bread with the Pasta was very soft , and the vegetables in fajita taste very bad.

The interior is tainted red lit and is dark (not friendly for selfie addicts, though you can go out in the balcony to click some pictures) There is also an uncomfortable pungent smell. (Maybe a wrongly chosen room freshner :P). The food and drinks are above average but don't deserve the pocket pinching prices.

Parijat Kundu,"Rated We spent a beautiful night partying with my colleagues at vault cafe. The decoration by itself was though quirky but minimal and tasteful. The ambiance was very lively with good music that was not too loud. The lighting was okay and seating arrangement was spacious. Now coming to the food, we ordered chicken cordon bleu, tenderloin steak with soya vegetables, grilled chicken breast with mushroom and peppercorn sauce, sizzling peri peri chicken, sumak chicken with spiced lebanese bread, five spice grilled chicken breast, exotic vegetables in spicy volcano sauce, brocolli in penne with white sauce, veg jalfrezi. Among these cordon bleu and tenderloin steak was just too good. Cordon bleu was juicy and crunchy at the same times and the mashed potato and brown sauce complemented it perfectly. The steak was well done and yummy along with the vegetables tossed in soya. The five spice chicken breast was also very tasty with the sauce and rice. The other dishes were also good though i can't comment on the veg dishes as I haven't tasted them myself. But according to my friends they were also good. We took mai tai and caiprioshka with kaffir lime among the cocktails and few aerated beverages. The cocktails were very good and balanced and I loved it. We got complementary dessert tiramishu and brownie with ice cream for posting our photos on FB....yayyy... Food quality and quantity was good and I would say worth the price. The presentation of the food was excellent. The service was very quick and stuffs were attentive yet they never invaded our space. They are also very helpful in choosing dishes. So overall it was fun and we enjoyed the foods also. Also their rooftop portion is quite nice and enjoyable. I would recommend everyone to go.",Rated 4.5,25,100,??

Gagan Deep,"Rated Sitting at vault. I made my mind to visit this place after i noticed it is in top apot and has a very decent rating. So when I visited this place. It is all red and seems like a place of all wrought iron loaded here and there( i believe rough design is in these days and I appreciate it). Coming directly to food, it is worthless, hyped and served chilled instead hot. Not tempting enough. Staff will possibly ask you to sit around bar as there is always waiting of approx half an hour and loose your senses at the bar itself so you wont get the feel of nonse taste being offered. Prefferably people must come here for hookah and this place is suitable for ones who just have to grab hookah and somw pint of beer as dont even have most of the brands in stock which is listed in menu. Now talking about staff, they dont even take orders properly. YES!!! They simply deny that we didnt order this thing at all.There is specific vault for large groups which I am not sure they offer that place to cwrtain very short groups meeting their CRITERIA!!! Staff dont care if you exist and people seems to be roaming around here and there, making it a complete mess. Music is good, infact amazing.

They do not take reservations on the phone and when you reach there the first thing they ask is do you have a reservation. And over it the arrogant manager never leaves his phone while talking to the customer. Drinks : They have a big menu but nothing is available. Food: Worst food in the city. I mean how can one not know when your fries are cooked leave aside any other dish. Cleanliness: They think that wiping tables would take away a layer of precious material off them so better leave it alone. And lets not even talk about the washrooms.

I have had the watermelon and kaffir lemonade which I recommend in the summers because it is definitely very relaxing. In the shakes- definitely the Chocolate Hazelnut shake!

Romil Jaitly,"Rated The place has got a really great ambience. It really makes a good first impression as soon as you enter the cafe. The place has got a huge area so its not congested at all. As the name says, it's got all the door in the form of valuts which seem pretty good and go well with the theme. There's a big bar on the far side but you gotta show your id before having a chilled beer (sad, i know). The food is not as good. You wont come back especially for the food atleast.

Place has got red ambient lighting and all doors have big mechanical structures on them resembling a Big smugglers Vault ... Coming on to food ... Food is served in optimum quantity and tastes really good ... Right from Chinese to Italian the chefs do a nice job ... They serve Vault Special Warning Extra Spicy Chicken Wings which was not at all this spicy and it was like Chicken wings Marinated in some South Indian chutney ... Really couldn't appreciate this Flavour. The Best Part about this Cafe Is Bar Prices ... Really Reasonable !,Rated 4.0,10,37,??
Namrata Saha,"Rated Awesome place to go for drinks! More the people,more affordable it becomes..but since my 2 friends and I were kinda out of cash,and they insisted that we come here..we ordered for three shakes which were like 250 bucks each. The shakes were okay,not that great. But concept wise its pretty cool..they have private vaults so you drink inside or go for hukka. And the lighting is red 24/7 so it gives it all pub kind of a feel. Service was quick.

Abhijeet Singh,"Rated Visited this place with a couple of friends to have some drinks. Interior Vault chambers (meant for private parties) perfectly matched the name of cafe. Remaining sittings were pretty normal. The manager could not even provide us comfortable seats. We asked our table to be shifted to another spot with couches as soon as one gets free. Even though , we saw number of people leaving the place but still we were never updated about moving to other table. Drinks - They don't serve Tuborg , Carlsberg or Bud. All they served were hyped premium beer brands like Corona, heineken. My question is mehnga paani kyu piye. Taste of drinks is subjected to individuals - I will say less variety in beer section.Though , their cocktail - vault 1857 is amazing. It was our friend's birthday. We ordered the cake from their place. There was no option for choosing flavours. They got us a chocolate cake which was satisfactory but prices were rocket high. For 1.2k bucks, we could have arranged a better cake from outside. Staff was friendly and courteous. Value for Money - It is more on the expensive side. No Happy hours. Plus loads of taxes (due to government). 2/5",Rated 3.0,4,50,??

We were greeted into The Vault perhaps more literally than weve ever been into any other place in recent memorythe place, to put it simply, is straight out of the pages of an Edgar Allan Poe novel, dark and brooding, with vaults and cellars lining the walls, lit only dimly by precariously low lights. we ordered white sauce pasta and veg burrito. Honestly, pasta was really amazing. Burrito is prepared in a diff manner but the presentation was really good and it was quite heavy as well. Only thing i didn't like was i had look for waiter at one point of time but no one was looking they were just chatting among themselves. Rest of the exp was pretty good.",Rated 4.5,25,137,??

Vivekanand Gorai,"Rated Its my 101 review on Zomato n it feels gr8 to share reviews with Foodie Community ! The Vault Cafe is in CP just near palika.We called up to make a reservation but in weekend's they don't take reservation so its FCFS (first come first serve). We reached at the pub around 8pm and it was Housefull.Rohit one of the suited booted guy told us that it would take minimum 30 minutes to get a table. So I took the time to walk around the pub. Ambience - The deco of the pub goes by its name. The Main door of the pub is designed as a big Vault u get to see in a bank.Inside the pub it has 3 section. Main sitting area, outdoor sitting n their Vault Chambers which are for private parties. On weekends they take only reservation for Vault Chambers n min gathering of 10-12 ppl n their is no extra charges.There are 4-5 vaults n they too have nice deco.Sittings in main pub area is big n they have cosy couches, tall tables n bar sitting. The best part pub was lit properly not like gothic look other pub turn into. Drink - We ordered Old fashioned 1857, Lavander flavour Cosmopolitan, LIIT n Absolute vodka. The Old fashion drink was served along with dry ice in a pot which gives out smoke n used to fill ur glass with ur smoke to give u smokey flavour. But the drink was too sweet so I would suggest to tone down the sweetness a bit as nobody like lassi :P in a pub.Same goes for Lavander flavoured Cosmopolitan. The LIIT came out to be best (do ask to make it strong). Loved the classic LIIT :) Hookah - we ordered double Apple. The hookah's were designed with Eifel tower, habibi style. Best part they changed the coal as many time u may ask for.Flavour was gud. Food - we had corn n cheese samosets bole to videshi samosha :P , olive n mustard chicken tikka, 5 spice chicken n olive pizza. Videshi sasoshas were crunchy n filling was cheesy n sweet corn.U too get 2 types of dips along with it. I liked the smoked flavoured dip which seemed like soya sauce. The other dip was spicy mayo.Next Olive n mustard chicken tikka was chew n was not tandoor properly. So we asked to replace it n they did it happily. But after that also I would say the mustard flavour was missing n tikkas could have been more tender. Why u call it Olive n mustard that i didnt understood.The 5 spice chicken olive pizza were so so . Probably they need to work bit hard on food taste n cooking side. Service - A+ from the beginning we were given a table. Initialy the table offered to us were couches but we wanted to sit on a tall table n they happily changed our table. Then service boy's Vasun n Surender took care of our table service n they were full of smile n served our drink n dishes in ziffy. Thank u boys :) Price - very competitive n not pricy like other gud raring pubs in CP. Bill for us 4.5k DJ - Thanks for playing 90's pop n famous tracks. We just loved it n shaked our legs crazily. Thnz DJ bro ;) Thanks Vault for the gr8 experience keep it up. N ya its a must visit pub ;) Cheers !!!",Rated 4.5,105,119,??

Cafe's in CP really didn't had that feel good factor anymore. I went to see my best college buds and was hoping to spend great time & our experience in the past was pathetic. we tried Vault and it was the one we always wanted to have. Drinks - the price is high, but who cares when you want to hop some beers, they have good range on beer on their menu but when we asked they had only three, that too premium lagers. Food - Amazing, the quality was good, fresh and it tingles your taste buds. Hookah - this is their USP, the hookah we ordered was just perfect. try it you wont feel cheated or robbed. Overall - Pretty amazing experience.",Rated 4.5,16,103,??

Three rounds of shots later, our mission was accomplished and all four of us girls where singing along and giggling and falling over one another. The service is a bit sloppy though.

But to my surprise the place was jam packed and we managed to get a place for 4 of us. The decor was amazing, loved the ambiance with dim lights and good seating 4.5/5 for it. The DJ played amazing tracks alongside. The best of all, is the menu and I can very well say that this is one place where you wont get ripped off due to heavy pricing. We had a tub of 12 Heineken which was decently priced, along with some great cocktails. Generally we don't find a place which serves great food alongside the drinks, but this place has it all. We had ordered a cheese margarita, spring rolls, a corn salad, a chicken breast dish, a white sauce pasta and we were all happy with the taste and the quantity of the dishes. So its a 4.5/5 for the dishes as well. The service is quite good and the guys are well trained a 4.5/5 on that as well.

He took great care of us. Kept asking me if am ok after I got little tipsy. Even bought me lemons. The staff is polite. The music is good.

The huge vaults were still making the impact on my mind and there I realized that we would have to wait for sometime and have drinks in bar before we could actually take a table to have hour meal. We didn't mind the same as the Manager promised us a nice corner to sit. He specially arranged two seats for me and my love. So, this infers that the staff is quite hospitable and humble. The place has an outdoor seating as well. While we set ourselves and ordered some snacks, to my surprise , I caught the glimpse of Karanveer Bohra. I was the first one to spot him and slowly everybody started clicking pics with him on terrace. So, this proves that this is an ideal place to be in Delhi on Saturday night and you can be lucky enough to spot some cool celebrities. Coming to food, the food was tasty. We ordered snacks and main course was delectable in every way. Naan were soft and fresh and we really had good time. The music n DJ is worth every moment spent there and the night rocked after 11:30.

Prachi Jain,"Rated There is no such place in CP as the vault cafe. What makes it unique is the private space (vaults as they call them) which hardly any restaurant provides (with no additional charges). They have got 5 vaults, each with a different interior and all the desired privacy. Next best thing is the variability in the menu. Noticeable was the street food menu which is not customary in cafes like these. There is something for everyones palate. Drinks: Old fashioned: A whiskey based strong cocktail. Will be treasured by those who want a bitter taste as the whiskeys bitter was further enhanced by orange bitter. Vault no.1857: This was undoubtedly the winner of all the cocktails. It aced the test in one shot. Everything from its presentation to its taste was simply erotic. Velvetiness of vodka and touch of vanilla is supposed to be a match made in heaven. This smoky flavoured drink had good amount of cardamom, which I appreciate. Cuba libre with hazelnut and mint: The blend of dark rum and cola is cherished by almost everyone. The twist is the hint of hazelnut which was flawless and simply gratifying for the taste buds. If you are looking for a lovely cocktail, go for this one. Surely a safe bet. Corn and cheese samosets: If vault would have been into catering, their best-selling snack would have been corn and cheese samosets. Dollops of cheese with a touch of corns sweetness, packed in pockets- this is what a real guilty pleasure is. Cheese balls: Pretty heavy, it was factually a ball of cheese. The outer layer did not interrupt in the taste of cheese. It is something that would make a person say uhmmmm before thinking anything else. Crispy broccoli, corn and mushroom: If your primary purpose to visit this place is to drink, dont forget to order these crispy veggies. They were mildly spiced and so crispy that they will better go with drinks than taken as starters for oriental main course. Dal makhni: Those who wish to eat the typical version of dal makhni, should not order it here. What they serve is a bit different. Creamy from the top, the ingredients unveiled their essences sluggishly as they came in touch with the palate. Thank goodness it was not garlic oriented.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Prachi Agarwal,"Rated It's a disappointment! There is no fresh feel to this place , it's just like any other cafe in cp. The food is nothing great and they do not serve what they display in their menus. The servers there have their ways around customers to earn themselves good tip.

Mohit Anand,"Rated After hearing a lot about this place, I finally thought of trying this and hence, I went there with my 8 official colleagues for a team party. We were first asked to wait for half an hour since the cafe was jam-packed. We waited for 5 minutes at the bar seats after which the waiter showed us the way to our seats. That's not all, those seats were hosted in an original ""Vault"". Thet big spherical Chamber gate, different types of sofas,book shelves and the dim lights gave us the feel of a real VAULT. Snacks which they serve are their USP. Veg and Non-veg platters, Dahi Kebab, Corn n Cheese Samosetwere prepared and presented well. Cheesy veg spring rolls, Soya Chap were not so good. Mint HUkkah was kind of faulty and we were not able to enjoy it to the full. However, we were totally satisfied with the cocktails like Cuba Libre with Hazelnut and mocktails like Green apple cooler, The Vault special. The Main course was kind of okayish and something, which could be skipped. The music, ambience and the aura of this place will refresh you thoroughly.

Sudhanshu Suman,"Rated So yesterday, me and my friends decided for a movie, only to cancel and go to a new place to enjoy some great time together and in comes the Vault Cafe. The place is right next to Nando's in the inner circle CP and has a great view from the terrace which we were told was closed done due to government regulations which were passed recently. Though to no detriment of the place itself, The Vault Cafe has managed to hold strong and boy o boy is it worth the time and energy and effort to climb nearly 3 floors. Upon entering the place we realised that the place was almost full on a Monday evening but still we managed to find a great spot for ourselves. The usp of the seating arrangement has to go to definately the ultra cool hobbit inspired vaults for families and couples and friends and the likes. They just brought that much amount of excitement and fun in the whole place. Talking more about the decor, the lightning was sufficient and the music was being played by a live dj who one would think accepts requests but tada he doesn't. We gave requests, reminded and then reminded again but to no avail nothing seemed to degree his informidable spirit to not listen. Coming to the food and drinks. The food they have gives us alot of options, and i mean alot. Ranging from Mediterranean, to oriental to Indian to North American you have plenty to choose from. But, there's a catch. They donot have good food items in their menu for vegetarians. All my friends are non vegetarians and they had no issues, but for me, the story was much different. I had to find and look and decide between very small number of items. I really hope the management reads this and understand that apart from everything else, one needs to have some basic understanding to cater to vegetarians as well. Though i do have to say that whatever i ordered was scrumptious and sinful i do hope when i go in the future, my options for ordering would increase. The drinks were outstandingly presented, with dry ice and the ice flowing from the bowl, im not atall doubting the presentation of food and drinks done by them. We ordered cheesy nachos with salsa, wild mushroom bruschetta, 2 chicken dishes, a pitcher of long island beach tea, a pitcher or Tokyo ice tea and vegetable assorted served with tofu and noodles. The food was brilliant. Though i do have to add the place is a bit too much on the costly side, but, good for a party and a group of friends having a drink and chilling. Will definately love to go again and again and I do highly recommend this place for everyone. Though if you're a vegetarian I would suggest you hold on a bit longer till, hopefully if, the management changes the menu a bit and adds more vegetarian items.",Rated 4.0,30,308,??

Ankita Pandey,"Rated I had to make this account on Zomato to write a review about this place I visited yesterday. First of all, this is not the review about the food or drinks there because we didn't have an opportunity to try them. It's a review on the horrendous management staff managing this place. I had no idea that customers can be treated like this because the numerous places I have been to, not even one of them had the management as arrogant as Vault Cafe's. They have written that reservation is recommended, but when you call on their number they will not pick up. So finally went there without reservation on my birthday (which was yesterday) because we have been wanting to try out this place, they told us there is a 20 minutes waiting for a table for 8. I was completely fine with it since it was Saturday and we didn't have the reservation. But even after 45 minutes of waiting the 2 managers there absolutely didn't care and were so arrogant like they are feeding everyone for free. No courtesy at all. And it wasn't just us, more people who have been waiting got the same response. Please note that waiting was not the trouble here, the bad attitude of the managing staff ticked us all off. Definitely a mood spoiler on a special day. I would not recommend this place to anyone who expects decent and courteous behavior from their server. Quite disappointing!! Not meant for celebrations as their seating is very public except for the vaults which you cannot book because they just won't pick up the damn phone :) Not going back, no matter how awesome their food or drinks might be.

Tanya Jain,"Rated Vault Cafe is a conceptualized cafe which is offering an ambiance of the rustic along with the world cuisines. The moment you enter the place you are welcomed into a huge tunnel oriented system where you begin to realize that you are in a Vault. The place is certainly huge and can accommodate at a time about more than 150-200 guests. The cafe gives you a feel which it did to me as if you are in an Old Ship and everything within belongs to an era which has went by. If you are a lover of things which reflects about its Ancientness, Vault is going to be a delight for you. The Beginning from Vault 1857 A Vodka based cocktail with Cardamom, Vanilla syrup, Pineapple juice, Lime juice with Vanilla air on top is the apt drink to begin with. Very smooth in taste and actually sets the base for the culinary journey which is about to begin. For a single person to experience all sorts of available dishes in a go is a task. In the Starters, they offers two huge platters with maximum possible items from different cuisines. If something is called Happiness on a Platter These were the two! A) The Veg Mezze Platter It offered a range of items with multiple dips. The platter had space for BBQ Onion Rings, Hot and Sweet Cottage Cheese Fingers, Smoked Cheese Balls, Cheesy Spring Rolls, Corn and Cheese Samosets and Wild Mushroom Bruschetta along with Falafel and Hummus. B) The Veg Indian Spice Platter Certainly spices add that flavor to dishes which can completely change the orientation. This platter was all about rich Spice and Spark. Crispy Broccoli Corn and Mushroom, Tofu and Bellpeper Chilli Sauce, Fiery Red Chilli Cottage Cheese, Tandoori Soya Chaap Garam Masala and Mushroom Satay. The range of starters is immense and are equally delicious with everything properly prepared and presented. Once one initiates, then follows a range of items which comprise of the Main Course. The Main route is the longer route and is a step by step intake. The Red Wine Sangria was in full bloom quantity and had that very balanced taste. We were then served Pan Pak Thai Noodles which are again really spicy and saucy red. Followed by Cottage Cheese Steak which is quite fulfilling and extremely delicious. The Vault Special Vegetarian Dumplings are a must for they are steamed dumplings stuffed with chopped asparagus, bell peppers, baby corn, carrots, peanuts and water chestnuts. These are one of the very fine dumplings which I have enjoyed and is a recommendation. One needs the tongue which not only tastes but also enjoys what is being passed through it. Chef Pawan Rana makes sure that each of its guests have that joy while they experience food here. It is said that Vault holds the Longest Bar in town. It certainly offers a range of items but I am yet to experience and explore on its being The Longest! Manhattan 345 a drink which is Canadian Club, Sweet Vermouth, Orange bitters with Maple air on Top is a hard drink to intake. Its bitter and strong and needs that strength to enjoy. Cocktails are always privileged but Mocktails are required to freshen the senses alive. Watermelon & Kaffir Lemonade is the perfect drink in this summer made with muddled Kaffir and Watermelon topped with Lemonade. The place serves the hugest Hukka I have ever seen and it was really Good.The white sauce pasta penne which we ordered needs to be worked upon for it was just about average compared to the awesome dishes we had which were absolutely amazing. In a three course Meal, the meal comes to its destination with the Desserts. Being a person with sweet tooth for me these sweet delicacies always become the highlight. We were served Four different desserts and each one of them were a marvel. A) Tiramisu One of the best I ever had. It melted in mouth like anything and left behind the taste which you wish should never fade. B) Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream The right mix with very freshly warmed brownie and the cold scoop of ice cream Perfect Compliments.

Saurabh Bhalla,"Rated Went with a group of 6 friends. Had to wait for 10 15 minutes to get our table. The ambience was simply fantabulous. We ordered a couple of drinks which were all awesome, Mocktails as well as poison. The variety of beer was limited but that is expected in CP. Food we order dahi kabab, bacon burger and a few more sides... Everything tasted good. The burger was heavenlyyy........ I'd go again just for the burger. We had a 15% discount via dine out so bill came out to be around 800 per person. Happy day :)",Rated 4.5,4,0,??
Riya Bansal,"Rated I had heard a lot of the place but never got the chance to go. So this time I with my gang decided to check this place out. As we entered, its got a bold entrance door, exposed brick work , it's got tinned orange-red windows, and seatings all around and at the end there is the bar. There are these separate areas well. We ordered beers, mint and lemon chicken and humus and pita for starters. All of them were cooked well. The pita was thin and good. But the portion of humus was less as compared to the pita served with it. For food we ordered chicken white sauce pasta which was good in taste but there was less chicken pieces in it. But the taste made up for it. We had also ordered pork and another chicken dish which were good too ! We ordered a cocktail named raspberry swizzle which was little too sweet and had less amount of vodka. Though it's a little heavy on pocket but the food, drinks and of course the music makes up for it ! Cheers team The Vault Cafe !",Rated 4.0,17,148,??

Shivam Maheshwari,"Rated I went to this place on a Monday afternoon with a friend of mine who had been to Delhi for the very first time. The interiors & the theme of the cafe literally blew both of us. They had the whole place designed in the form of a vault. The doors have been specifically designed going by the name of the cafe. The dark lights complemented the interiors. As it was a Monday afternoon, there wasn't much rush. We took a place of our choice. They majorly have sofas for seating arrangement which were very comfortable. The ambiance was also soothing. The food & drinks were above average and not that exceptional. Though I liked the Chicken Wings with Bbq sauce which I ordered. The service part was very annoying. There was no rush during the afternoon, still the service staff took a lot of time to bring beer pints. Overall this place is a visual delight & can be visited with friends to enjoy its unique theme.",Rated 3.5,32,43,??

There are floor managers who would help you. People are welcoming. Ambience/Seating: This is the USP. It is very pleasant to look at. They have designed it so well. It has 'vaults' with circular doors that have separate seating areas. The seating is of different variety, ranging from high stools, chairs, sofas to high table. The lighting is lovely. It is minimal with yellow bulbs. Also there are red tinted windows through which sunlight enters the restaurant lighting it with red hue. Value for money: For the ambience and food, yes it is.

On first glance, yes the interiors and the ambience is amazing so points to the owners for that. However the food and the service was not at par with the standards they boast. We ordered a four cheese pizza and a sizzled peri peri chicken. The peri peri chicken was good, the mash potatoes served as a side were very good however the four cheese pizza was a huge disappointment. The cheese used was bland tasting and the pizza overflowed with grease. On top of that the service was slow and unresponsive. I expected a better experience from this cafe.",Rated 3.0,1,118,??

Udit Batra,"Rated The vault caf is located in F block of the heart of the city, connaught place where you can see the national flag standing tall in the central park. This is just the surrounding of the place, trust me the ambiance is even better. Right from the main entrance to each and every thing in the cafe is based on VAULT style look. They have a choice of terrace dining and caf dining, my pic will be the indoor dining unless it is really pleasant outside. So as you unlock the vault and enter the place, you are about to have a time to remember. BEVERAGES OLD FASHIONED & LONG ISLAND ICED TEA are two drinks that never disappoint anyone doing full justice to their classic tag. VAULT 1857 is their signature cocktail in memory of the revolt of 1857 with vodka base fusioned along with pineapple juice and lime juice with vanilla smoke giving it the added feature of gastronomy. FOOD THE VAULT SPECIAL VEGETARIAN DUMPLINGS- These were the best veg dumpings i've ever had, as they were filled with asparagus, bell peppers, other veggies and water chestnuts indeed a must have. CURRIED PRAWNS WITH CORIANDER DIMSUM- Prawn dumpings steamed to perfection served steaming hot onto the table, how else can I describe this beauty of a dish that tasted so nice. CHICKEN WINGLETS WITH CANDIED LEMONS- Chicken winglets smoked with utmost perfection served alongside candied lemon wedges, this is another must have. DEEP FRIED SPICY CHICKEN WONTONS- Wontons are basically another variety of dimsums mostly served with clear soup, in this dish they were fried golden brown and served with a spicy dip, these were indeed a burst of flavours and calories. CRISPY BROCCOLI CORN AND MUSHROOM- This is their take at the world famous crispy corn with a fusion of mushrooms and broccoli chopped to bits matching the size of corns, a vegetarian delight recommended to all. GRILLED FISH WITH LEMON CAPER SAUCE- Grilled fish is always a delight to have and when it is served with a butter and lemon rich caper sauce you are bound to ask for a repeat just like I did. SUMAK CHICKEN WITH LEBANESE BREAD- Sizzling hot sumak chicken served with their lebanese bread cut in triangular shape, served with a side of sauted exotic veggies like zucchini, pumpkin and bell peppers. DESSERTS They don't have a preset menu of desserts as they have a dessert or two everyday that keep changing. CHOCOLATE CAKE SLICE- A freshly baked chocolate cake topped with chocolate sauce and nutella put the sweet tooth to rest peacefully and with utmost satisfaction. CHOCOLATE BROWNIE WITH ICE CREAM- Topped with chocolate sauce the brownies and ice cream are nothing out of the world but they indeed are sinful enough to make you go WOW for the taste. A shout out for CHEF GURPAL and our server RAMDUTT who made sure we had a hassle free yet memorable experience dining at this wonderfully managed caf. A 4.5/5 it is from my side and I will be back soon.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Vaibhav Mehra,"Rated So after trying out a couple of cafs In cp, I finally landed up at vault today by chance, being from amritsar all the cafs I had been to Delhi looked quite nice to me, but Vault took me by surprise, the amazing interiors, the perfect concept was just so eye catchy. so I have all praises for this cafe and would rate it the best one I've been too, the vault chest, omg what a drink, I just don't know how to describe it, the grilled chicken vault special, chicken dumplings, red Thai curry and the Ferrero rochher shake were on my menu for the night and my god they were amazing. Coming to the Hookah now, I haven't seen such fancy hookahs in my life ( not even abroad) so I ordered the Khalil Shisha ( commissioner Flavor) and a long good looking shisha came to my table which had perfect ice hose to add the chill and coal caps, the presentation was out of the world. Haven't had better shisha before. My experience was a 5/5. Team vault your doing an amazing job, kudos to the man behind this cafe, I am sure he would be as legendary as the cafe.

I'll recommend this place only for drinks. For food, I'd rather go to the nearby Kebab Xpress. Oh yes, a word about their washrooms. They are badly made.

Sanya,"Rated So it was casual thursday evening hangout of 5 people. I choose vault cafe based on the zomato rating. As far ambience and decor goes, I would give it a 5 star,dim lighting, spacious, music at level to enable conversation. But for food and drinks, it was pretty average, the quality and taste did not correspond with the price. The total bill value of Rs.2450, wherein we ordered 5 drinks and 2 appetizer Now to start with drinks, we ordered a glass of sangria, one jack daniel, one Ferrero rocher milkshake and one chocolate milkshake and also a pint of beer. The sangria was too sweet and did not have any distinct flavour and tasted more like a cough syrup.The milkshakes were fine, but both ferrero rocher and chocolate milkshake tasted similar. For appetisers we ordered nachos and dahi ke kabab.The nachos were ok not pretty great. If you are looking for good nachos, try Zamozza. Dahi ke kabab were an utter disappointment, not crunchy on outside , to gooey on inside not properly cooked at all.

Manish Gulati,"Rated Go spiraling up on a tight looking endless stair and you will end up in this burlesque looking space, reddened with sunlight, peering in through those crimson red glasses within the windows. Designed to look like a 19th century British vault this place does not fail to shock you if you go there in the afternoon. We went there for a quick business lunch between meetings. The place was almost half full on a Monday afternoon with people lazying over hukkas and drinks. A big difference that you would see between the business rich delhiwallahs vs the corporate yuppies of gurgaon. Anyways, we were seated on a table for two near the window by this delightful fellow 'Nizam' who, over our 45 minutes experience in this place made sure that our glasses were never empty of water and our plates never devoid of food. Such brilliant service, that you felt he was constantly watching over you, almost tipping over to the point of stalking :) won't complain as this kind of service is a rarity in a lot of restaurants today. We ordered a couscous salad, a grilled zataar chicken and a spaghetti aglio olio peperoncino with chicken. Asked our nice attendant if they could add some bacon to the pasta alongwith the chicken. He gladly obliged with an extra cost. Now, this 'can do' attitude from a restaurant I love. Food arrived fairly fast. Couscous was fresh and fragrant, the grilled zataar chicken was juicy and succulent. A spoonful of couscous, with a morsel of chicken, smeared with hummus and a bite of pickle and we just could not stop that sequence till the spaghetti arrived on the table. The Pasta was cooked amazingly well, no tomatoes,clean flavors of olive oil/garlic, hearty quantities of chicken and bacon freshened with good amount of mixed fresh herbs. The whole dish had this amazing smoked flavor from the bacon, its almost rare to find such refined cooking of pasta in restaurants usually at this price. We were highly impressed with the way that whole spaghetti dish was put together. Nothing was out of line. perfectly balanced flavors of garlic, chilies and bacon with olives. Couldn't decide between the two cuisines that we had ordered and within fifteen minutes everything was polished off with wide grins over our faces. I would like to go again and try their vast menu. Most of the restaurants that create this elaborate world menu end up creating kitschy flavors where you cannot distinguish one cuisine from another but, here both the cuisines stood out and I hope the same perfection continues with others too. nobsaboutfood.com",Rated 4.5,208,764,??

Ankur Bharadwaj,"Rated Vault Cafe in my opinion is the Best cafe in CP . A Very Huge area with a Unique interior and decor are the USP of this place . A very elaborate Bar menu with a lot if variety to choose from , Every Brand of Beer and Whiskey is available here. Although LIT is highly recommended here, They serve in a wooden box with dry ice and when is comes there is a lot of smoke. Another Highlight of the place is the Different Vaults section where you can sit with a group of friends . Food is also very good , Quality and Taste wise so you will not be disappointed with anything you order. In my opinion you will surely get your money's worth over here.

Yaduvendra Singh,"Rated What else would you call a caf with private areas inside, well, vaults! Cute and cleverly done, Vault Caf is the newest diamond in the rough by the team behind OTB. The indoors are interesting, but the outside area is the best place to sit during good weather with music that is a mix of lounge and foot tapping numbers steering away from the same old commercial music. Vaults menu is anything but sparse with innovative categories like street foods featuring Vada Pao, Dabeli and the likes, alongside national dishes like Goulash from Hungary, Paella from Spain etc. There is a lot to choose from and we went with the BBQ Onion Rings, which sadly turned out to be just regular onion rings fried way too long and served with tomato ketchup and a not so BBQish dip. The Smoked Cheese Lollipops were half decent though and prepped us for some libations. The bar menu features classics with a new mixology twist and names like vault mixology, vault specials and something called a vault chest. They claim the latter is the biggest pitcher on order anywhere in the country, though we are yet to try it out. We would need a more prepared liver or more company for that. Priced at a reasonable 2500, one can choose from classics like Margarita, LIIT, Mojito, Old Fashioned and Tom Collins. Every drink from their signature section comes with smoke that has been flavoured to match the drink or with flavoured foam. The Rum Julep (golden rum, cinnamon and vanilla sugar syrup, angostura bitters with cinnamon and vanilla air), and The Moscow Mule (vodka, gingerale, lime juice with ginger beer air) were somewhat similar in taste despite having no common ingredients. The overpowering syrups are the first thing to hit us and the flavoured smokes are a fun touch with a little tinge of showmanship and a mild flavour. I usually don't have much expectations from the food in places like these where the focus is more on ambiance, drinks and music , but the food did impress . We ordered Schumak Spiced grilled chicken with humus , tzaziki sauce , and pita as accompaniments. The chicken was spicy yet balanced . The humus and tzaziki were of perfect consistency. The lettuce and orange salad which was a great combination of citrus orange and crispy lettuce with vinaigrette dressing. The next in line were the celery and mushroom dimsums served with soy sauce and green onion vinegar was outstanding. The veg pepper salt i thought was a bit soggy and could have been better. The soup of the day was the veg clear soup which had a homely taste had a good portion size and was simply presented. We must also point out that although the service was courteous and available they were surprisingly clueless, which is a little off-putting. Making a reservation is a good idea owing to the place brimming over even on a weekday.",Rated 4.5,32,330,??

Garima Wadhwa,"Rated I have been here twice but both the times it has been a disappointment particularly on the food end. On the first visit we ordered for white wine sangria, red wine sangria and pasta... Sangria was over sweet n pasta so so .. This was during day when it was not much packed. The next time we ordered for chilly paneer , pasta Alfredo ,chicken burritos,margarita pizza ,beers and peach ice tea and tiramisu. Peach ice tea again was sugar loaded with barely the peach flavour, pasta was too spicy being Alfredo ?.. It was overloaded with red chilly.. Burrito was fine and chilly paneer was way to oily. Tiramisu was better off then the food. Pan rasna hukkah was good. They badly need to improve on the quality of drinks.",Rated 2.5,10,67,??

The ambiance of the restaurant lives upto its name with well crafted interiors. But you can't keep staring at them the whole while right? The food was below average. We ordered a chilli chicken and honey chilli potato which were extremely substandard. And you could find more onion than chicken. The portion were extremely small. And well the coke we ordered was flat. On mentioning it, no heed was taken. Vault has possibly the worst service. The waiters did not care to clear the table, after repetitive instructions. So we had our meal with hoookah that wasn't ours, and dirty plates. And all this comes for a staggering 1500. Stay away from this place if you don't want to have a bad experience.",Rated 1.5,1,95,??
Shivanshu Gupta,Rated I visited this place on a wednesday night and never expected a houseful on such a night. But this place somehow manages to attract the people of delhi everynyt to turn it into a houseful.. The reason i think behind this is the amazing ambiance they provide both outside and inside.. Music is so lively that u cant get bored.. Crowd is always very happening at this place and the managers are experts at managing such a heavy crowd. We had the very famous LIIT chest here(images attached) which was not that impressive as it was too diluted but when v ordered a glass of liit it was very good and well concentrated.. Food too was very tasty and the portion sizes were also very good... Till this tym my experienced was 5/5 but then i made a mistake of ordering a sheesha which surely sucks big tym here..

From food to ambience to service to shishas , everything was on point! The shishas were out of the world , they were smooth , the flavors weren't the same boring-tried & tested ones but they were different with interesting combinations. The shisha service was quick & efficient. We tried the vault chest drink which again didn't fail to excite me & my friends. The food was just according to our taste , grilled chicken , thai curry , chicken nuggets & pasta in pink sauce were some of our absolute favorites!!

Now coming to food and drinks, we ordered ine strawberry and mango smoothie which was yum and must try along with toblerone shake which is average and can be avoided.

The entrance is built with a vault door and the inside seating lives upto its name with extremely dim lights and antique finishes. The outside sitting & the view is a very pleasant change from regular cafes and the menu has a number of cuisines. The hookah is decent but what disappoints the most is their food & service. We ordered a Chilli Chicken which was so spicy that it literally burnt my tongue & I choked on the first bite. We placed a request to change it and the waiter initially argued that its usually spicy. Its only after he took it to the chef that he came back & apologized and agreed that this is abnormally spicy. Later they replaced it with Chicken which was extremely dry and bland. The LIIT and Pasta was also very average. I so wished a place as well built as this had better food & service and less stinking washrooms.",Rated 2.5,26,159,??

All in all an amazing ambiance and even a really nice crowd. Coming to food and service. Their service is really fast, I ordered a chilli chicken and it was served within 5 minutes. Ordered a thai curry which was really nice and creamy and tasted really fresh, it had basil leaves in it which gave it a nice taste. The LIT was also very nice and had a nice strong taste to it. The only thing which I did not enjoy much was the sheesha, had to get it fixed 3-4 times and by the time it was fine I was too full and not in the mood for sheesha anymore. But still would give this place a good rating for the really nice food and fast service. As I went out with a smile and my stomach full.

Vaibhav Jain,"Rated This place located at a nice place - with nice interiors, though the idea of having a vault cafe was good. Well i like the textures & all but it was nothing really different from others. Lets come to the interiors & the basic serving - which is serving a menu and and and after you have decided what you want to order keep waiting . . . No-one comes to write an order. You call them once, twice & thrice. The fourth time my friend said is anyone interested in writing the order? Then a person standing near us came and wrote it saying i am not the person to write it. Wow and this kept happening for almost 25-30 minutes. This was not it, we placed the order and thankfully order was served in good time, so thats a good one. We ordered 3 Ferrero rocher shakes - tastless they were - we have had them before i found if very bad. Generally ferrero rocher shakes are nicely blended and hard with good amount of sweet this one was totaaly opposite - felt like drinking a cold coffee that to very liquid. 2nd was the veg soya chaap which was good. Nice. We loved it. Delicious it was - though we didn't get enough of mint sauce but we were okay with it as we liked the chap. After that comes the spicy pasta i don't know what any friend ordered in this one. However this pasta was well cooked but the taste was not good it was very sour & unlike to taste. We could have asked them to reserve it. But them remember we have to look for someone and call them. No-one was nearby or crossing - most of them were busy doing i don't know what. & this is not all while we were eating we also ordered sheesha which never came to us for almost 30mins and then when we asked he was like i am just going to start preparing yours all we could do is cancel it ask for cheque and leave. The music was also good though. But then when you want to eat food. This place is not the right one. The overall experience was okay-okay. Investing good amounts in this and only look-wise good.

Monil Bhardwaj,"Rated Vault cafe, CP. One of its kind, the theme is quite unique and innovative. I went there with friends on sunday afternoon and the place was fully occupied. We took a vault, and it turned out that the space/seating was less for our group having 13 members. Coming to te drinks, we ordered Vaulted Chest 2600. This comes with dry ice giving a pleasant effect. It was enough for 5-6 pax. Other drinks were okay. In food, ordered dahi ke kabab, dimsum, honey chilli patao, all three were good. Non veg snacks were also appreciated by my friends. Now, main reason for rating 3.5 is the non-value for money factor. If you love to spend big, this is for you.

Perfectly complement the drinks. Gonna try more food options on next visit. P.s If the weather is good, prefer having a table on their terrace & enjoy an ecstatic view of our tricolour hurling high in the central park.

Komal,"Rated Well, this is my 100th review and what other better place it could have been than the much hyped 'Vault Cafe'. I was really excited about going to this place from a long time after seeing all the awesome pics on Zomato. Interiors are excellent. Definitely worth a visit. The different Vault PDRs that have been made are excellently designed. Coming to Service , you won't get water unless you ask for it ( and forget the refills). A lot of options in the drinks menu were not available. They just want to be selling their cheap beer I guess. But we ordered mocktales and were better off. Coming to food the taste is very Okayish. The thin crust Pizza wasn't crisp at all , it was very soggy . The quality of mozzarella cheese was also not seeming good. The Mediterranean Platter again lacked taste. The falafels were too oily and pita bread didn't seem fresh. The mocktales we ordered were good All in all I can say Ambiance 5/5 , Food 2/5 and Service 2/5.

Yash Sharma,"Rated Just like another lounge this place comes with a nice concept of vaults (as the name suggests). Ambience is good with hookahs and aroma around. And the live screening of a match adds flavor to your food. Try to get a personal vault that gives a secluded place to you. Coming to the food, Nachos with cheese is awesome. Even the cottage cheese fritters are good. The quantity served is adequate. You can also get a place out in the open on the top floor. USP- the vaults and open seating.",Rated 4.5,64,286,??

Richa Gupta,Rated One of the few places where the name stands true for the ambiance and the service. The place is beautifully designed and can be checked out anytime during the day. 1 extra for that. We entered at around 5 in the evening when there was still some sunlight and it looked beautiful when that reflected on the booths and the bar. A 0.5 for that. The Crispy Chicken Bacon Strips are a delight to the stomach. A must try. The menu is slightly over priced but it totally seems worth it.

Large space.. does not get cramped even when full.. the sheeshas were good, and a variation on the LIIT did pack a punch.. What did not work.. service was very slow.. it took 5 mins everytime to get attention.. food was average.. nothing which did not meet the bar, but nothing which would excite you. Ok if you don't have super expectations.. only 3 beers for a long list in the menu were available.. for a place like this - no leffe, Stella, hoegartden, and the likes.. not acceptable.

Rahul Batra,"Rated This concept restaurant has another address. Situated at an amazing location in CP this restaurant has redefined the personal touch with locking you inside a VAULT with your friends. A vault can be booked for a minimum of 8 people and they have a Vault as big as for 20 people. Good enough for a crazy personal hangout. But experience is not everything for which people pay for. We pay for food and also drinks. A good menu in terms of drinks, they have a decent range of alcohol. In food, i didnt find many of the good options in fact. Just the regular multi cuisine restaurant and i expected some great names defining the presence of this restaurant like shawarma in deposit box or may be Burglar's special. Just random advice in fact. Food is average, nothing so great in fact and i would say order something regular as they dont have any specific flavors. Service is not so good, this is the point where they lose on all the marks from my side. In fact i had to address 3 times to just take money. Not fair at all. Anyways, i think i would visit this place again with a whole bunch of friends and have some private party kinds in their vault. Cheers... bragstreet.in",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Dr Ashwani Mehta,Rated Heard so much about the place so landed up at around lunch time. Complicated way about going there and the person standing down had no interest in guiding us. Reached the vault and the ambience is true to the name. Did not work for me. The staff is wanting to please and I ordered a classic margarita. The glass I thought smelt of kerosene they changed my drink which had the same problem. Gave up on drinks. They suggested their dimsums are the best. Ordered and found them to be so ordinary. Thick skins. Ordered another dish which totally sapped my confidence. Quietly paid up and left never to come here Again.

However, since I'm not a fan of too jazzy stuff, I wasn't really comfortable here. So I took a place in the balcony area with some friends. I'd gone here on a weekend evening. Hence, there was a lot of crowd and the ambience was perfect accordingly. I really liked the food they served. Had ordered a mushroom salad, chicken breast with saffron rice and pan Thai noodles. The salad and the saffron rice were good. The noodles were okayish, but still something different. A nice place for all those jazzy party lovers.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Samyak Ranjan,"Rated With such positive reviews and feedbacks at Zomato, how can you not go to this place? Under a scorching summer sun, me and my friend looking for a new place to eat ended up at Vault Cafe. My experience? Just sad! Starting from the very bottom, the person incharge of ""welcoming"" you to the cafe seemed in a bad mood and when I asked where is the cafe too, she roughly pointed towards the stairs. I asked which floor to she replied 'second'. Oh well. Reaching the second floor after what seemed like a long spiral staircase we reached Vault Cafe. We entered and we found it full. Hookah's, group parties, couples, you could spot them all here! We stood there in the middle of the cafe for about 3-4 minutes and not one server came up to us asking if he could take us to our seats. I exchanged eyes with one and asked him if there was space for two. He found one table and took us there. Going through the menu and not being able to pick nice things, we asked the server for anything he would recommended. He opted for the chilly potatoes and we ordered that with a Nachos Platter with 2 shakes. Chilly Potatoes (4/5) Crisp and made fresh, the chilly potatoes were nice. It had bellpeppers and the usual vegetables topped with sesame seeds. They were crisp and nice! Nachos (2/5) The nachos were just sad. I mean they tasted exactly like the ones you get at normal grocery stores and the salsa sauce was just too bad. The second dip, whatever weird mixture of cream or butter or whatever it was, it was not good AT ALL! Definitely not worth the price tag! Toblerone Shake (3/5) Although I could taste the toblerone in it, it was just not cold or thick enough. Granted it was a shake but not enough chocolaty. Chocolate and Hazelnut Shake (3/5) Following in the lines of the Toblerone shake, this too was a sad disappointment. I mean okay it did have chocolate but well, too much milk and too little if any hazelnut. But although this did taste refreshing. We asked for the bill and waited for 15 minutes before asking for the bill again. We asked for water but we never got any. We had to ask for tissues as there were none on our table. This is just sad service. And these four things with taxes costed us 1150 bucks. Please improve!

Nabamalika Joardar,"Rated Vault Cafe has very appealing interiors; I suppose that is what draws its patrons to it. I spent an evening celebrating a friend's birthday there, and we all spent half the evening waiting for our drinks - at one point, we had waited twenty minutes for our next round of drinks to arrive. The daiquiris were a huge disappointment (we had ordered the Orange and Cinnamon Daiquiri and the Daiquiri with Star Anise and Leechi) and I have never had a worse Long Island Iced Tea. The food was better, but nothing to write home about. I would recommend the Fiery Red Chilli Chicken though, it was really good. We also ordered a hookah - the flavour was mellow at the beginning and made for really smooth drags, but within one coal change, the hookah was done and no number of coal changes could save it. If Vault focussed on upping their drinks game, maybe it would be worth a second visit and spending all that cash!",Rated 2.5,17,219,??

Even the outdoor seating is really nice. We were 9 people. So the staff had to join tables. They don't have a seating for a huge group, i believe. For drinks we ordered 12 pints of budwiser, came in a nice bucket filled with ice. Then there was wisky. Also one of my friend's ordered Baileys, it was filled with to much ice. Two others ordered the water-melon drink, which they liked too. We ordered 3 hookahs, brain freezer, pan rasna and sex on the beach with milk base. The milk base wasn't good. Rest all were nice. The staff is extremely polite and were willing to change the coal time and again. For food, we ordered : Nachos Spring rolls Honey chilly potatoes Veg.

We ordered 6 pints of Heineken (after they told us there was no Bud or Tuborg) and smoked cheese balls. When our food arrived after a really long time and we started munching, I found a small piece of plastic in one of the balls. We immediately informed the waiter and he was ready to replace it. But again, our order got mixed up and something else arrived on our table (which was weird since there were not many customers that time). Finally, our correct order arrived and the management was kind enough to not include it in the bill. We were just charged for the beer (and yes, the beer is pretty cheap here as compared to other such places) We were satisfied with the overall experience and loved the dingy decor of the place (which would look better at night of course!)",Rated 3.5,35,318,??

The first striking thing about Vault Cafe was the ambience, assisted in no small part by a great playlist. The Vault Chest, which I tried, and also happens to arrive at your table in an actual chest is not for the faint of heart but definitely worth a try. Their wood-fired oven seemed to be doing a good job with the pizzas too. But what struck me the most were the Khalil Mamoon shishas on offer, which are near impossible to find in Delhi.

Prachi Kapoor,"Rated After hearing so much about this place, I just had to try it out. The result: UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT! Let me start at the beginning. First of all, we asked for some water (yes, they didn't serve it on their own , we had to ask for it); Halfway through, I discovered something floating at the bottom of my glass. We asked our server to change it, which he did without any apologies. Next, we had a look at the drinks menu and were momentarily happy with the extensive variety of beers that they had *on the menu*. On the menu is the key phrase here, as they did not actually have ANY of the beers listed on it except the ridiculously priced Murphys. So that was disappointment number 2. We had to make do with a ginger ale and Diet Coke. Though I must say, the ginger ale was good. After the drinks fiasco, we finally ordered our food: Butter Chicken Pizza and Grilled Chicken Breast with Spicy Sausage Rice. The pizza was AMAZING, so much so that we saved a couple of slices for the end, just in case the second dish wasn't as good. And thank God we did! Because the second dish turned out to be disappointment number 3. Chicken breast is supposed to be soft and tender. Opposed to that, this was hard, and difficult to cut and to chew. The gravy was weirdly spicy. Though it wasn't bad, it might not cater to all tastes. The sausage rice was surprisingly good. The vegetables served with the dish were supposed to be sauted according to the menu, but they seemed more like boiled. The only one good thing about Vault is its ambience. The staff was not the friendliest or the most attentive. Service was slow. Coming to prices, food is reasonably priced whereas the drinks are ridiculously expensive. The only highlight of the place, for us, was the Butter Chicken Pizza. Wouldn't repeat or recommend. PS: if it's not urgent, avoid the washrooms. The partitions inside are see-through.",Rated 2.0,25,90,??

The entry to the place is nice and after hearing a lot of positive comments about the place, my expectations were quite high. But sadly, apart from the good entry and a somewhat ' depends on taste ' interior, there is nothing thats good about the place. The music too, is very loud. The veg platter was very inconsistent, pizza was tasteless and just don't ask me about the horrible pasta. All the drinks, and I literally mean almost all the non alcoholic drinks are really bad. In fact, the Ferraro roscher shake tasted like bournvita in milk! I gave very clear instructions to the barmen to get myself at least one good Mocktail but I guess he was too full of air about himself to even listen to the instructions.

Foodie Heart,Rated I was eyeing this place for a long time . Finally I went there . Ambiance is nice . They have these cool vaults . Loved the concept . Music is nice. We chose to sit around the bar area. Place is quite happening . Menu is huge!!! Quite extensive choice . They also serve ShiSha that too in a really attractive Eiffel tower shape. We ordered cheese spring roll and the vault cafe special dumplings . It took them 20mins . But it was worth the wait . Dumplings were less in quantity but they were the best I have had by far. Perfect selection of sauces to make it more amazing . Cheese spring roll was gud too . Drinks were killer. They have the best cocktails . Well tasted and presented . This place is a hit . -0.5 only because I felt they must work on the portion of food which in my view is very small. nyways I am definitely going back there as frequently as I could . And yeah it's not much heavy on the pocket too!!,Rated 4.5,42,196,??

This place is a cocktail of amazing ambience , great food and well priced drinks ! For cricket lovers , Vault Cafe is a bliss, with the huge screen and beers.!! We had ordered - Strawberry and Mint shake which was one of a kind. I had never ever tasted something like that. 6 pints of Tuborg which they serve in a cute bucket , chilled ! Nachos and salsa platter was also surprisingly huge and equally yummy. The food was great , drinks very decently priced , and interiors are bomb !

Rohan Kaler,"Rated Overhyped!!!!! Went there on a Sunday evening with friends, the ambience (inside) was good but it was poorly managed with many tables meant for 4-6 been given out to couples. We were told to go to the smoking zone area (but we saw people smoking in the nonsmoking area as well). It was 30 something degrees outside, they had fans and weird water dispensers but it had little effect. It was around 8-8.30 and the sound of horns from the inner circle was louder than anyone talking. After 5 mins of waiting, we were finally blessed with a waiter. Courteous kind and respectful are NOT the words you would associate with the staff. We placed our order and anxiously waited for it. 15 mins later the server came to us and said the liquor we had ordered went out of stock. This ticked off my friend (who is generally a calmer person ((known him for over 2/years)); he complained about the service and the behavior of the staff) At this point of time, we were too pissed off to order anything more( The food we ordered was way over priced and deserves no mention ); this could be a one off experience, but this place has surely been blacklisted in my book.",Rated 1.0,12,80,??

(Not like i heard) It was too normal, nothing tastes special (we were around 25 people and ordered almost everything to make variety) There were less no. of non-alcoholic drinks (only4), so it was disappointing. Drinks were not served decoratively so as food. According to the popularity, it was not as good as that so it looked overpriced.

Devesh Sharma,"Rated I visited The Vault Cafe, CP today with my friends. First of all i didn't understand what the inner vaults were meant for. They were empty. Still we were not allowed to sit there as they said they are reserved. And when asked on phone. They weren't ready to reserve. This is ridiculous to begin with. Then the ambience was fine. But i must tell you, on account of service. This has been one of the worst places I've ever visited. You need water, ask them. We were 5 people. After 3 reminders also we were given 2 glasses. And water is supposed to be served even without a reminder. Then, the starters were ok. Not great. We ordered honey chilly potato, a paneer tikka pizza, and cheese balls. Well decorated but nothing special. But taste was fine. Then in the main course we had Dal Makhni, Paneer Pasanda and Lachha Parathas. Dal was fine, i particularly liked paneer pasanda. It was different. But Lachhas were awe full. One of the worst I've ever had. Almost looked stale. Not crispy. Not heavy at all. Though the bill was pretty ok. Its not an expensive place if you don't drink or smoke hukka's. I don't. So. My experience was pretty average. Had higher expectations. The service really needs to improve. I needed to call the staff for everything i needed. Again and again. That's pretty bad. But food and price was fine. The decoration and theme is carried well. So 2.5 stars.",Rated 2.5,3,1,??

Rahul R,"Rated I liked this place, honestly. Loved the concept of the vault and the place looks comfy enough. Though, I think it looks more like a wine cellar than a vault. Then again, Cellar cafe doesn't sound half as cool as Vault cafe. Actually, the interior design felt a bit confused, cool or not. The menu is really limited, if you are looking for dinner but it is a great place to hang and it's really huge. Of course, it would be wise to reserve a seat beforehand because we had to wait a lot to get a table. Rather a teapoy... The meat eaters among us went safe and ordered a tandoori chicken. 8 pieces of awesome. While the vegetarians courted risk with a Dahi ke kebab. It tickles my curiosity but I didn't have any, so I'll tell you about it another time. I ordered a malabar parantha along with the tawa mixed chicken. Well, the malabar paratha was OK but it would never satisfy anyone who has actually had the real deal and the tawa chicken quantity was disappointingly small. However, they tasted good together and we ask had a good time and that's what matters :)",Rated 4.5,18,19,??

Neelav Samrat De,"Rated We went and we were surprised to see The Vault full to its capacity of over 200 people or so on a Sunday evening! Had to wait for about 10 minutes to get a table! Good sign! Great ambience, good theme and a huge place! Good music and a terrace patio as well! Super! Mr Joydeep Dey a certain enthusiastic Manager took great care to ensure we were seated and got a Maitre d'htel to look into our orders. We began with the vault special veg dumplings. It had asparagus, bell peppers and water chestnut and made for a good starter. Then came the smoked cheese balls which was cheesy and wonderful. The Caprioska with kafir lime, vodka, orange syrup and blood orange was a very refreshing citrus and lemony cocktail. The bellowing smoke added to the presentation. Super drink! Having asked for a mock tail, Joydeep suggested that we try the Vault fruit bull which had peach, watermelon, ginger and lemon. The fruity flavour made this mock tail a super drink again! The barbecue onion rings were ok though I don't prefer deep fried eats but the barbecue sauce was just right. The cheesy spring rolls were a killer! Loved the gooey cheese that poured out with each bite. Super sexy stuff made just to my liking! Nice. The chicken satay came accompanied with peanut sauce and the combination was actually good. The chicken was soft and flavourful from the marination! Good starter to try for sure. The chilli chicken was ok. This could be improvised a little. The cheese ball was again a great accompaniment for the drinks. This is again recommended. The non-veg platter is Indian in nature with tikka, amritsari fish, mutton & chicken sheekh kabebs. The fish was soft and nice and so were the sheekhs. The malai tikka was also good but a little hard. The second cocktail we ordered was the raspberry sizzle with vodka as the base. The companion loved it! Having asked for the chicken wings barbecue, the other mock tail that came up was the watermelon and kafir lemonade. The chicken wings were good because the barbecue sauce was good and not sour for a change. The mock tail was super as usual. In the main course, we asked for the Vault Special Grilled chicken. This dish comes with 2 pieces of grilled chicken breast pieces, rice and a Cajun sauce. The chicken was hard and I think this could be improved. The butter sauce on the chicken was great. Just before the dessert, came the prawns in fresh red chilli! Super like! Huge prawns, in a spicy chilli based marinate, I loved the thing! The prawns were soft, juicy and really awesome. Really good and well prepared! We ended the romance with the palate with a tiramisu. Well ended that! Soft, fresh and coffeed! What I am really impressed with is with the service. Inspite of a packed full to capacity busy Vault (!), the service was really good. Each dish we ordered came in a very short duration and the maitre d'htel Vishal was patient, warm and courteous. Joydeep Dey does a great job as a Manager. I loved the drinks at the Vault. The food is no doubt good, they could add up to the presentation to create the appeal. A very nice place which is recommended! Try the sheesha too!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Right from the valet guy to the bar tender, from their grey suited managers to servers, every one. They do not have call back service if the place is booked. They make you wait at the bar and stare at you constantly till you order yourselves some drinks. We were given a table outside, where there were bunch of boys, who were talking at the top of their voice and smoking, which created a bit of problem for us. I went to one of their grey suited manager and asked if they could accommodate us inside. He looks into my eyes for 5 seconds and then says we have no space inside. I then came back to my table and placed the order. I ordered tenderloin steak and waited for him to ask how I'd like it. But he started moving, I called him back and asked how you gonna get it cooked? He says 'you tell'. I said I'll tell, but you got to ask first.

Vandita_Roaming Gastronaut,"Rated My first visit to this place was a few months ago when it was new on the block. I have to say I was totally blown away by the sheer size of the place. The plush seats, the dim lighting and the vault theme- the place was bound to create ripples and it did. It was after a very long time that I went to a place that invested so much in the dcor. Most cafes and restaurants these days are focusing more on their services than the ambiance they offer. But I feel, in todays fierce competition, both are equally important. The Vault Caf will totally floor you when it comes to the ambiance. It is indeed a lounge that is nothing like any other, if we talk about the few vaults that they have constructed inside the large hall that has their seating area. Each vault has a different theme and can accommodate 6-8 people. The one that we got seated in on our first visit, had a brown couch with couple of chairs with matching nice leather upholstery. The wall on one side was dedicated to a collection of wine bottles (perhaps the vault had a French theme!) and some artifacts. On both occasions, I have been here in the evening so havent had a full-fledged meal. I have tried their Herbivores Delight pizza. The name made us expect the most delicious veg pizza but it was just average in taste. The dough wasnt very soft and they could have used some variety of veggies for the topping and also more quantity of the toppings. The chocolate truffle did not taste fresh. It wasnt rich or decadent either. The loaded nachos are a great option to order with drinks. The portion size is immense and you might run out of capacity to drink before you finish your nacho serving. More than the food, I enjoy being here for the music, the ambiance and the energy of the place. The terrace is a great option when the weather is nice, as it offers a great of Connaught place and the majestic national flag. roaminggastronaut.wordpress.com",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

We ordered a Chicken tandoori tikka ( best if all ) burrito, cheese balls, penned pasta and a few mocktails. The service was super duper unexpectedly poor as the waiters seemed a little confused. They were also not able to explain the chef's special. All in all an amazing ambience with good food with average staff sums up to a confused 3.0 Review 2 : An ambient restaurant, a Hep DJ, a superb decor, great food but woohoo where is the cutlery ??? Come on ppl.. That's common sense. We ordered all veg today. Arrabiata penne pasta was the best. Food was superb but we have to ask for the cutlery repeatedly.

Aakash Maddi,"Rated Ambience: 3/5 Quantity: 2/5 Quality: 4/5 Value for money: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Best things to try: Pizza was really nicely made. May be it's a choice to try. Experience: After all those reviews and ratings on Zomato, I made it my venue for a reunion with a friend. The ambience was nice, but sort of oversold. It's a nice place to hangout when you have a bigger number of friends to meet at one place, their special rooms or vaults do a great job. Coming to the service, things were prompt, gentle and nice. So, they get good rating for that. Now, the food. Food is normal, nothing out of the world. You should try the pizza for it was really well made. We tried Mexican food and a little Tofu and generic starters. Overall, they're good enough food but the portion sizes are hardly enough for anything, whether you're down for a drink or just the food. It's a good try in the heart of Delhi if money is not your concern. Also, they mocktails and smoothies are great. Do give them a try. Oh, the DJ was very pumping. Great music.",Rated 3.5,24,445,??

We had a booked a vault which was not very spacious but we had our privacy and is good enough for a small group. The food was good , priced a bit on the higher side given the location. We ordered a pizza , pasta , chicken and chilly potato and not one of the dish was disappointing. The best part was that the staff was very helpful and the speedy service was not affected despite it being a crowded Saturday Night. Our drinks were refilled timely.

We ordered chicken tikka , malai tikka , pizza , spring roll , panner tikka , all of em were served really hot and fresh . The beer was chilled and the hookah was also pretty good . The dj was playing good tracks and the match added the excitement . If we talk about the price , yes its a lil pricy but well when they have spent so much on the interiors they will obviously charge for it else how will they make profits ?

Aastha Khanna,"Rated I was absolutely intrigued by this new place and the concept to which they cater. The place is big and has different interiors. The music selection is good and it actually has 4-5 vaults inside but which are only available of you are a group of 10. I went there for lunch with a couple of friends and somehow requested to be seated in the vault and we did manage to get in. According to me, sitting inside is not such a good idea, as you lose out on the whole feel of the place with the good music. It seems secluded and the Ac's inside are not so effective and the music is hardly audible. I preferred my table outside rather than inside the vault. The one major problem with this place is the service which is not up to the mark( the reason they got 3.5)! Thought the staff is courteous but I think they are not enough employees to handle the crowd even during the lunch hours. They are slow and confused when it comes to serving. After calling 5-6 times, one person would turn up. They confused out order and delayed it which was not at all expected from such places. Coming to the food , I loved every dish we ordered. The chefs are doing a great job with the food but the service offered by this place bring it down a notch. We ordered : 1. Tandoori chaal : amazing soya chaap with stuffing. The stuff was good ! 2. Grilled fish with caper sauce : loved it. The marination and the flavours . the caper sauce was really tasty. 3. Chicken fajita : absolutely delectable . I loved it. They serve the fajita in a sizzler plate with pita bread and dressing separately, so you can eat it as you please ! ( recommended ) 4. Mutton korma : the curry was good but the mutton pieces added were not soft and tender and the portion served is less . 5. Masala chicken tikka : yet another good dish . loved the curry and the preparation 6 . paranthas : their breads could have been better. Specially the lachha parantha! 7. Hookah : not so good ! A little on the expensive side, this place would have been a delight had the service been more organised but in the end the food might win your heart ! So should try (y)!",Rated 3.5,78,1021,??

I ordered three cocktails, vault no.1857, orange and cinnamon diaquiri and Caprioska with Kaffir lime and blood orange. Although vault no. 1857 was a li'l too sweet for me, I loved the cardamom flavour in it. The other two cocktails were just perfect!

I m surely not rating them on this but still I believe they can improve on this part. Also one of my suggestion to vault caf is dat they should make sure that people sitting in pvt.

But what's wrong with the food, guys? I would say a visit here has been my worst food experience in CP. How can you have a basic pasta on the menu yet go wrong with that. I have never been served an over cooked pasta at any place, ever. And the chef doesn't understand what's wrong with it? We ordered fish and were disappointed once again.

The whole cafe is a vault and inside it are many vaults for a gathering of 8 or more people. The food is not the best i have had. But, it will make it worth your hunger. One point that hit me is that they will serve alcohol to anyone as long as he looked old.

Rachit Goel,"Rated Once again, the search for reasonably priced drinking places led us to try this place. The person standing behind the podium at the entrance is rather indifferent to your requests. We asked to check the bar menu and asked for any ongoing offers and it was a flat 'no'. The entry to the Vault is rather impressive. Making you feel like you're entering the vault of a top secret agency. The ambiance inside is appealing too. Painted in shades of red and brown with a few private rooms (smaller vaults) thrown around. We had to start at the bar counter since the entire seating area was occupied. The bartender was polite and prompt. That's a big plus since I've seen rude and indifferent bartenders. Soon, the maitre d' made us shift to a corner table which was perfect for a gang of four guys whose only aim was to drink! So, we had a bucket of Tuborg and a Hookah. Grape with mint packed quite a punch, however, the service was a bit slippy when it comes to hookahs. The refills were delayed, rendering the flavour useless. We ordered Honey Chilly Potatoes and Chicken Lollipops which were decent. Nothing to brag about them here. The waiters were polite except for one strange thing. They have come up with a policy that you have to leave you credit/debit card with them EVEN if you're going to the balcony area for a smoke. This was not only utterly stupid in my honest opinion, but also rude. Moreover, this 'policy' isn't mentioned anywhere in the cafe's menu. What surprised me more was that the waiter was unwilling to accept my argument that I'm not planning to take the aerial root to exit the cafe, neither do I intend to run away not paying the bill. The manager had to be summoned who cooled down the dispute. Apart from this, the experience was great. They tend to turn up the music during the prime hours 7-12. The DJ denied playing Rock music but played some foot tapping retro and modern numbers which were pleasing. I'd rate the overall experience a 3.5. Had there been no bickering regarding the credit card it would have been a 4. Guys, please have all your policies written down. It is a boon for both the parties.",Rated 3.5,8,152,??

Incredible is the word, the ambience is one of the best in the city, the food in terms of quality is second to none, the DJ belted out all the international hits ( so glad that there was no punjabi /bollywood until he left towards the end and someone else took charge.) i mean we all love punjabi and bollywood but too many places have an overdose of those 2 genres, not this place though so thats a huge plus ! service was top notch ! Yes its a little expensive but if you want to have a really good experience you must be willing to shell out a few more bucks, i did and i dont regret it. I am happy to say that the place does justice to its reputation, For all the cricket maniacs, there is a big projector screen showing live IPL action. The menu is extensive for both food & drinks, will i come back ? absolutely! and next time it will be for a smashing party at this kickass place !",Rated 4.0,17,103,??
Jyo,"Rated After stepping on 'N' number of stairs you open the door of this vault to enter breathing heavy.. All you get to experience is a peppy ambience and very nice interior out there. The theme of this vault has been followed well. The best part is the separate sections that you can sit in isolation with the cafe with your friends/partner. Now talk about the food it was just awesome. I being a non veg lover ordered seekh kabab, chicken garlic dimpsums and chicken nachos salsa. These were just anything better than awesome.

The first thing i noticed while getting inside the cafe that it was so spacious and not at all congested like other bars who keep seating arrangements so close. They have properly utilised the space sply the separate Vault created for the group parties for 10-15 ppl and all can enjoy with there personal space.

Ashutosh Dhar,"Rated Visited Vault on a weekday, expecting it to be empty and spacious. You enter through the door of a giant Vault, a la Happy New Year style. Its quite spacious from the inside and they have ample space outside overlooking Palika Bazar and the Indian flag at a distance. Beverages are very very reasonably priced, which came as a shock; pleasant though. Tokyo Iced Tea is worth trying but you need to tell them to cut down on the sweetness. They have multiple types of platters - Indian, Mediterranean and Crunchy which was the best part. Most of the places usually just one type of platter which limits the choice. All platters had decent sized portions and tasty as well. Did not get a chance to have the main course. Staff was courteous and did not raise an eye about multiple demands from a 15-pax table.

I called up to book the table and confirmed i will be late by 15-20 mins from the usual time of booking, still they didn't keep any table for us to watch the worldcup final, moving on the interiors are nice and well done to support the theme, But you do feel a little bit suffocated in the private vault areas. Environment was lively, service was quick, all thanks to (Aahan). But i wasn't really happy with the food apart from chicken lollipop and grilled fish, Shawrma was tasting like a vegetable roll(cold and dry). But must say the lollipop chicken was really amazing. They have a nice view from the terrace area. Unfortunately it was raining in bits when we went there. But yes it is a place you can visit once due to a diff concept they have. I am a big foodie and to be very honest its really difficult to please a person who knows every good place in delhi to have his munch. 3.5 out of 5 i would say is a fair rating including a great service by the team, the last thing they didnt include 15% discount as promised by bitequest, i dont know everywhere i go i have to remind them after they bring the bill.",Rated 3.5,3,2,??

The wooden interiors gives its rustic, country look. I guess you could wale away time enjoying the decor or have some food. Here are a few that I tried: 1. Mojito : Ahh my favorite drink was prepared really well with a special twist of cloves. 2. Chicken Wings with Barbecue Sauce: Prepared to perfection in the classic way with the nice sweet and spicy barbecue sauce. 3. Sarsoin Chicken Tikka: Another fusion food with chicken marinated in mustard cooked in the tandoor. It was really good and recommended for people with a taste for the spicy stuff. The sheesha was by far the smoothest I have had anywhere. The drinks and the food were also very well prepared. The place should be a must visit for people looking to sit down with a drink and relax. Since it was jam packed even on a weekday lunchtime, table reservation is advisable.

The music being played made it all the more enjoyable. Next comes the food. We were three of us and ordered for a Pasta, BBQ chicken wings and some grilled chicken with rice.

The place is not that grand and huge and the covered area is also comparatively smaller against the rivals. The portion quantity is good. Though the service was prompt, the stewards themselves didn't volunteer to help. The place was full even on a Saturday afternoon which very well defines its popularity. It being the daytime the great AMBIANCE of the VAULT CAFE was not really prevalent as sunlight entered through the wide windows. We ordered BBQ onion rings, a mock tail and Crispy chilly potato. Both the dishes were very nice and tasty though a bit spicy. The BBQ onion rings were very crispy. The food was very well presented and service was quick despite the place being almost full.

We order chicken piri piri pizza , cheese wasn't properly cooked, chicken chunks were stale, tasted as if fried and frozen and at the the time of cooking was put on the pizza and reheated. However the chicken arabiatta penne pasta we ordered was little better topped with olives tasted good. A kinghfisher beer pint costs 90 and 6 pints cost 480 so its quite cheap. A signature cocktail is Vault's fruit red bull, it was quite good. Overall average place. Only the ambience is the factor of attraction. Its based on Vaults as the name suggests.

The concept is different and appreciated. Though, personally did not like kids around in the cafe with their families drinking and doing shisha. Though, I do not care much if the kids were around or not as they did not bother me but as a morally not a good sight. Otherwise, good lighting ( red all around) and a good place to chill out with a large group or may be as a couple as well. Service was good but had to wait on a Sunday night.

Started with The Vault Special Chicken Dumplings which were pretty decently prepared. Chicken Wings were next and they should be avoided as they were pretty measly. Spinach & Cottage Cheese Dumplings and Cheesy Vegetable Spring Rolls were next and both tasted just about ok. The Shish Taowk and the Platter were both strictly average.

Sahil Avi Kapoor,"Rated Visited the Vault Cafe on a Monday afternoon, and was surprised to see it brimming with energy! Most of the tables were occupied and it surely didn't seem like it was a weekday. The interiors are beautifully and tastefully designed, with big, heavy vault like doors at the entrance and even for the washroom. Loved the private areas (good for 10 - 12 people) that were designed like an actual hole - in - the - wall vault. We started by ordering a Long Island Iced Tea pitcher and were pleasantly surprised. The LIIT came in a fancy, wooden tub, literally smokin' thanks to the dry ice added. The cocktail was strong and just the way an LIIT should be! Only complaint - less quantity than there should be in a pitcher. For food, we first ordered the chicken shawarma and a portion of reshmi kebabs. While, the kebabs wrapped in a fluffy egg coating were wonderful, the shawarma was extremely average. Special mention to the delicious hummus though. A BBQ chicken thin crust pizza and a peri peri chicken breast followed. The pizza was flavourful, crisp and light and was consumed by the three of us in a flash! The peri peri chicken though was not great again. The chicken breast was too dry and the peri peri sauce was put on to it in a measly quantity. But again, the cheesy hash potatoes served with the chicken tasted well. All in all, wonderful ambience and fancy cocktails. Food was good and/ or average in alteration.",Rated 3.5,41,378,??

Suchintan Kar,Rated Worst service ever. So unattended we felt that we had to leave the place halfway.

Nikhil D. Thiyyar,"Rated So i came here for a lazy Saturday meal and I was mostly not disappointed. The place has an innovative and awkward seating arrangement, they call vault; it's claustrophobia inducing and you would do better to sit outside. The balcony of the place is magnificent especially in evenings, although you would do well to avoid if during the summers. The food is good, the drinks reasonably priced. The music played here is the good old school classics. It was refreshing to hear some Floyd after a long while. We ordered a shawarma and some peri peri chicken. Both these dishes were well cooked. All in all, a pleasant dining experience. I would come back here if I am meeting someone in connaught place.",Rated 3.5,2,22,??

Srj,"Rated Vault cafe has a couple of things going for it; the location is excellent, The al fresco gives a good feel, the concept is nice though not very well executed, and the music played is good so fine for those who wanna have a drink or two with friends... I visited Vault sometime back, and liked the vaults concept that had seating inside but beyond this the Vaults dont exist. All the people I know who have been here; most of them even dont like to sit inside those Vaults as a matter of fact. The Ambience otherwise is reminiscent of something like a Warehouse cafe. Area wise too the place is big. My advice would be to sit outside provided weather is good as the view especially of the Indian flag and Cp is really nice. Menu/food: Many options across many cuisines are available, and I ordered a soya seekh kebab, for mains a cajun spiced cottage cheese steak in creamy spinach sauce with veggies n mash. For drinks, I had a water melon kaffir mocktail. Soya seekh was decent in taste but did not have any good flavours, the main was a let down, paneer was chewy, and the sauce did not taste good at all and was completely unlike what I expected. Mocktail was average as it was too sweet. Service was average as the servers were not really keen on taking orders and the staff at the Al fresco was not prompt. Vault can be visited but it is not a must visit place.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Vidya Ahlawat,Rated Vault is available only for group of 6-8. Somewhat strange. Very interesting place. Starting from gate (which gives feel of a vault) to the interiors.

Especially the 15-20 minutes they took to get me a glass of water after we had paid for our meal despite frequent requests.

Sakshi Bansal,"Rated So THE VAULT CAFE has been in talks mostly because of the theme.modern dining experience and the ambience and it totally lives up to that part. The entrance is pretty impressive and the theme has been maintainted throughtout the cafe. The big flat screen is a perfect addition for the cricket fans and the private seating areas (with entrance of a vault gate!) is impressive. The table arrangement and furniture selection is spot on. but sadly the good things end here. We were highly disappointed by the food. We ordered the tandoor trail with a toblerone shake and none of them were any good. The platter for starters lacked consistency, some of the things were delicious including the pickled onions while others were just a sad addition to the plate. The shake (supposedly tobelorne) tasted like a regular chocolate shake(even worse) with absolutely no taste of the chocolate plus is was not chilled! This was a big put off. Also the staff was inattentive. The outdoor seating is okaish but the view is great. Overall its a one time visit just for the decor but eat before you head out!!",Rated 2.5,58,346,??

The food is little expensive as compared to the their quantity which they serve. I Had ordered crispy chilly potato, Tofu wontons and crispy platters. After seeing the quantity of the platter i had to literally ask the waiter ""bhaiya yaha aisa konsa item h jisme qty zyada ho? nd he rplied aisa yaha kuch bhi ni h.The price of Alcohol is average. we had ordered the beer bucket (6 pints).

Never leave this order if you planning to go Vault Cafe. and its ambiance is itself another great place to spend the quality time.

Sahej Ghai,"Rated Ok firstly, let me tell you why I am giving a 2.0 for such an overhyped place.. one point for the ambiance and decor which is good and especially if u r seated in the vault like area for the pvt party. This would be great if the manager actually gives u this area inspite of it being empty. The rooftop area overlooks the central park with the big Indian Flag. Half a point for food which is tasty..the butter chicken pizza is good, tasted actually great since I had waited 45 mins for it being served. Half a point for their tequila based hookah..as no other option is available (what we were told). This is not it, after you order your experience at this place enters a world of confused waiters, slow service and uncooperative staff. It's like these people are celebrating SLOW AND STUPID WAITERS DAY. I got three differnt answers for one query from three differnt waiters. Then I had ordered butter chicken pizza which came after 45 mins and three reminders,it was like they were ordering it from somewhere else. I then called for chilly chicken pizza but the waiter got confused and again got me butter chicken pizza but with a speciality that it was FREAKING COLD. The staff is highly arrogant and uncooperative. Your request for tuning up the music or change of place won't be entertained..why? Well probably because they r getting more than guest than they expected and think a few unsatisfied customers won't be a problem.

Interiors are warm & inviting. Got a table on a Saturday night after waiting for almost 15-20 minutes. No entry for stags on weekends, so plan accordingly. We ordered our drinks which arrived instantly. Started off with Dahi ke Kebabs which were soft and moist. But they were too sweet to be combined with hard drinks. Next came the Chicken Wings with BBQ sauce & they were delicious. Chilli Paneer was just okay. Chicken Satay was bit over spicy, but the chicken was tender & juicy. Overall a variety of starters with good taste & superior food quality. Portions were bit on a lesser side. The washroom area is in a cover & women section was over-crowded with a long queue outside. Vault should thing over this. Service is good & staff is smart. May be next time I will try their outdoor seating. Vault is only available for a group (6-8) & do make a point to ask for it when in group. Prices are affordable as per the quality of service offered.

Amar Arjun,"Rated VAULT CAFE is undoubtedly one of the best places to have a meal,chill and have a great time with friends in and around CP. It is a relatively new place in CP and survival in that neighborhood is really toughif you are anything shy from GREAT and not only has this place survived but THRIVED! This place had been in my wishlist for quite sometime and recently when i got a chance to visit this place, i grasped it without a moment's delay. It is located in F block, they have an elevator as well as stairs leading up to the cafe. Once you enter it, the 1st thing thing that strikes you is the sheer size of the place with numerous seating arrangements to accommodate different size of groups according to their needs. They even have a seating option inside VAULTS, you heard me right, COLOSSAL VAULTS! As well as a rooftop dining for those who enjoy admiring CP's beauty at night. The place has this amazing BLOOD ORANGE lighting to it which complements the vibe of the place really well.The servers were very attentive and menus were served in a matter of minutes. After going through the menu, we ordered a VEG MEDITERRANEAN PLATTER, a 4 CHEESE PIZZA, a SPICY PERI PERI CHICKEN PIZZA , a CHOCOLATE & HAZLENUT SHAKE, a COSMPOLITAN and a BASIL ICED TEA. The drinks arrived in about 5-10 mins and were a pure bliss. The SHAKE was chocolaty and smooth in texture and was not very heavy to drink while the COSMOPOLITAN according to my friends was a delight and perfect specimen about how drinks should be made while the ICE TEA was cool and refreshing without the basil overpowering the drink. The next to arrive was the VEG MEDITERRANEAN PLATTER and it one of the best I've had till date , the FALAFEL was fried to perfection with a crisp outer covering and soft & hot filling inside with the flavor of chickpea coming through. The FINGERS were yet again fried to perfection but were a little under-seasoned and in terms of taste it was quite identical to the FALAFEL. The PITA was soft and rolled to perfect thickness while the TZATZIKI was cool and refreshing with an amazing creamy texture and the HUMMUS was an absolute ripper with an amazing pungency of the garlic and a drizzle of olive oil on the top added to the flavor. The main course arrived as soon as we ended with our platter and i was quite impressed with the prompt service. The 1st to arrive was the FOUR CHEESE PIZZA and it is really hard to wrong with this dish and it was spot on! A thin crust base with molten cheese all over it and great marinara sauce at the bottom, PURE BLISS! Next to arrive was the SPICY PERI PERI CHICKEN PIZZA and it was a delight to the palate, they have managed to perfectly blend the flavors of PERI PERI into the pizza without making it overbearingly spicy and the spices are really well balanced by the generous amount of cheese over it! It is one the best meals I've had in CP and it's a quite a feat given the no. of meal i've had at CP ! :P I will be returning to this place very soon and trying my luck with some of their signature dishes.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Deepti Kumra,"Rated I had been hearing a lot about Vault cafe and the quality they serve in very reasonable prices! And all of that is very truee! From the pictures I had seen on zomato, I thought it would be a very shady restaurant for a lunch but it was amazing.. As soon as I entered this cafe, my focus was on lighting which was very unique.. Blue and a tint of neon orange. It was dark but yet there was a lot of light. I loved the ambiance. It was completely jam packed and me and my friends had to wait on the bar for our turn to come. It took quite a lot of time but the waiting was worth it. Service- 3.5/5 the service was above average. The staff was quick and efficient. Food- Sizzling peri peri chicken: 5/5 true justice to the word peri peri. The chicken was extremely spicy and saucy.. The mashed potatoes were perfect and the saute vegetables were also cooked perfectly.. Not soggy and not hard. The chicken could have been a little softer although. Mushroom kurkure: 5/5 Huge pieces of mushroom with a crispy coating and a filling of cheese! Heaven it was! It was served with green chutney and extremely spicy and masaaledaar onion! The onions were complementing the plain taste of mushrooms perfectly! Herbivore's delight pizza: 4/5 Jalapenos, olives, babycorn, onions and cheese! The pizza was really tasty.. Honey chilli potato: 3/5 The flavour of the honey chilli potato was average and the potatoes were not perfectly cooked.. All in all.. I loved the place and the ambiance and ofcourse the food! This place is a must visit atleast once.. And this place is very reasonable keeping in mind the services and the quality they offer..",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Apart from the regular seating area which is quite nicely done, they also have private vaults for larger groups and rooftop seating. It's a bit difficult to get the rooftop seating though. I had ordered the vault special extra spicy chicken wings and margarita pizza. The chicken wings as the name suggest were quite spicy but absolutely delicious. The thin crust pizza was also very good. I had also ordered the watermelon and kafir lemonade Mocktail, which was quite a refreshing drink. The place was full, probably that's why the service was a bit slow. Good price for money. Definitely visiting again.",Rated 4.0,50,29,??

Piyush Jain,Rated Went last night for dinner with my wife. Got disappointed from valet parking itself as when valet parking guy asked for Rs. 100 for valet and handing out voucher of 100 rupees discount on bill and telling us that you will get your 100 rupees back on your bill. As the restaurant was pretty full. And we ordered for veg salt and pepper and Mediterranean veg platter with hookah and diet coke to start but unfortunately the food was so disappointment that we can't order more food and left the place.

CA Gaurav Agarwal,Rated Cp is becoming a place for happening places. Vault is one such happening place with a different kind of ambience. A good place for a group to get a place for their own because as the name suggests they have different sized vaults. The rooftop is an added advantage. Overall the place offers the similar food and booz which other places provide. But it's diff bcoz of the ambience and the menu of drinks.

Ashish Bhardwaj,"Rated I had asked this friend of mine for a coffee on the eve of Feb 10 and did not want to go to a regular coffee joint like CCD, Starbucks etc. I had already been to The Vault Caf once and loved the place so decided to go for Vault only. The pleasing weather, scrumptious outdoor sitting and the beautiful view of CP (Including the flag) made our 1st hangout a memorable one. Though its well known for its cocktails, we decided to stick to coffee only and ordered cappuccino, cold coffee and honey chilli potato (We did not even had the option as it was a dry day..:P). To our surprise, the coffee was really delicious and the honey chilli potato was mouth-watering. I know its an eerie combo of coffee and honey chilli potato but we really liked it. Sometimes what you all need is a change to enjoy and having a good coffee in a caf like this is always a +1 for us. We could not try much but came out with a thought of coming here again.

They will server you drinks with half the quantity of what you would expect though the presentation is nice. And after ordering a pitcher LIIT i understood that why everyone is having only beer.

Ashima Saxena,"Rated I'd say it's a brilliant place. I've been here twice already in a gap of three days and I can see myself revisiting more often. The first time was a lunch treat for 14 people and getting a vault made it so comfortable. Usually when you go out for treats with more than 6 people you are accommodated on long tables and the conversation gets lopsided because everyone cannot talk to everyone. The food is quite good and the service is prompt. Id recommended the spicy piri piri Chicken and the Thai green curry with chicken. The fish fingers were good. I've had better tartare sauce but I am not complaining. Tried the shwarma and sumak spiced chicken. Nicely done. Tawa masala mutton had a nice thick onion tomato gravy but the mutton was rubbery and chewy. I've taken off one whole point because a lot of what is listed on the drinks menu is not available . And it leaves you disappointed because with such an exhaustive bar menu you want the place to keep it's bar stocked as well. If you print it, you should have it!!

The vaults are good if you want to hold a private party. We settled for the indoor seats. The service was fast and the servers were courteous. We started with the cocktails and ordered vault cafe signature vault no 1857 which was vodka, pineapple juice, cardamom and vanila air on top and was beautifully prepared. Also their cosmopolitan was a perfect combination of vodka, cranberry and triple sec. For the food we ordered vault special extra spicy chicken wings which were spicy and had good flavours.

Coming to the food, for the food i had, it did hurt me to pay. The quantity of the food was good enough but quality and taste was definitely questionable. I ordered -pasta arabiata which was good but yet average when compared to many other places. - chicken dimsums, they were soggy and didn't taste any good. - nachos and salsa platter which was fine. - peri peri chicken felt a little undercooked and did not taste nice at all . - ginger ale is the only thing I'd say was tasty.

Prateek Bohra,"Rated A winter Sunday afternoon and a long pending treat from a friend was the reason we went to Vault Caf. There wasn't much crowd and people were starting to come in. The highlight of the place at the first glance is there Ambience, going by the name itself, Vault Caf gives the feeling of eating in a vault. Its theme is based on the Vaults inside ships and otherwise..Starting from the door to the cosy private vault rooms and the outdoorsy seating, the large bar area...Vault has carved a name to be reckoned with, in ambience preferred restaurants..We were greeted by a cheerful server. Started off with Honey Chilly Potato, I am a crazy fan of Honey Chilly Potato's, served in a Pan, a first that I saw in any Caf serving good Honey Chilly's.. Much to my amazement, it had fried vegetables with the potato's, another +1 for, who doesn't like to have Deep fried crisped with cornflour Chilly potato's, these were fresh and juicy. The sauce wasnt overdone and the sweet portion didn't let the taste go wild. Arabiatta : The pasta was a bit cold, maybe the winter afternoon cast its spell, ignoring the cold part, the pasta was good too. Balanced with the right veggies and sauces.. Mojito with basil and clove: Not a typical Mojito you'll have at other places, the clove flavor isn't cherished by many, but I enjoyed the variation. On a base of white rum, for a non-drinker this was a disappointment and I had to leave the drink half because I wasn't able to take the medicinal taste(No minus to the drink though) Brownie: Spongy hot cake topped with A vanilla scoop. This dessert was the perfect end to our lunch that day! Food: 3.5/5 Ambience: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5 (He ll be a sight away, always) Prices: All this cost us 1800! 4/5",Rated 3.5,101,851,??

Usually my CP trips are for quick beer along with something to eat as the primary goal..:) This is located on the 2nd Floor next to Nando's and Punjabi By Nature Quickie.. The positives - I) like the open terrace thing and it becomes quite nice if you go there with slight chill in the air 2) Cheap beer - 90 bucks for a pint is probably amongst the cheapest in CP (3) Interiors - this has been done quite dramatically and with a lot of money being spent...flip side - its too loud Negatives - ordered a pasta in chicken with peri peri sauce. The pasta seemed to be made by a novice..too much of thick gravy kinda stuff with overcooked fusilli in it. Honestly I thought the gravy was the same as that of any Indian chicken dish with fusilli added on it and mixed together (pic attached) Got that returned and asked for Fish n Chips - that came without tarter sauce n the server said he forgot to give it...elementary, i say. It came with sliced onions though...well...and the taste was pretty ordinary. Beer though cheap but wasn't cold at all...well.. The problem here is simple..they want to serve everything- from Indian to Chinese to Continental etc etc but guess with only One chef managing it all...well.. It wasn't a great experience but will go again, guess why? Cheap beer and open seating silly..:) Avoid if you cant tolerate passive smoking cause you will constantly be doing that..@",Rated 3.0,20,60,??

The concierge from the cafe had no clue about what the condition is upstairs, how much waiting time, is any table availabe or not. Why was she even there if she couldn't do this much of work, having a co-ordination with her staff upstairs. We had to go ourselves up and find a table. On reaching on the respective floor there was no staff to escort to the table(if available). It seemed as if i had come to a house party where i have to find a place myself and grab the food from the main table. We had to find someone ourselves like for 10-15 minutes to know the status of the table after which the lady was so casual to tell us that we should come some other day as we mite have to wait for an hour or so even after which she wasn't sure that she'll be able to give us a table or not. Seriously??? Ain't these guys taught to take the number of the customer and call them when the table is available knowing the status of the tables instead of telling the customer to come some other day.

Then we order our starters which was not so quick as we almost wait for 20 mints for them. Then we order our dinner which also quite late and tastes okiesh not too be great fan of it. Over all good place but when we asked for a vault 4-5 times which was already vacant the staff denied straightly.,Rated 3.5,7,1,??
Utsav Gambhir,Rated The place creates a good impression with the ambience but getting a table allocated is a pain in itself even when there are vacant tables. If you opt for the seats at the bar counter remember that they don't serve any food there. Though I wish they could atleast serve starters or at least notify the same before someone takes a seat there.,Rated 3.0,1,1,??
Vidhi Malik,Rated This is one of my fav place in CP to chill out with friends. Food quantity is good and taste is very nice. The service is bit slow as you need to rush behind waiters for everything even for a glass of plain water. My suggestion is go here for a hangout and when you have plenty of time. You will surely enjoy food and ambiance. Special seating area in cabins are kept reserved for large groups and not provided easily till they can accommodate people outside and the keep on telling that those places are reserved but in reality it is not. Eating here in groups would not make a big hole in pocket if you do smart ordering as they serve bread/rice with every gravy dish.,Rated 4.0,6,1,??
Anu,"Rated I visited this place with my friend expecting a nice and warm evening. We thought of sitting outside just for the glorious Indian Flag view. But finally decided to sit inside because of the chilling weather. The interiors inside dont disappoint either- the rustic, colonial interiors adds to the whole grungy ambiance. The fascinating bit is the inter-connectable vault spaces with huge metal doors that can be booked for private, larger parties. We started our evening with chicken nuggets and chicken strips, followed by butter chicken pizza. Must try dish would be wood fire baked Butter Chicken Pizza which is thin crust and simply mouth-watering. Overall me and my friend had a pleasant evening and would love to visit here again. The staff is also quite friendly. I would rate it 4/5.",Rated 4.0,1,1,??

We wer three ppl n thght to b seated inside. 9/10 in terms of decor n interiors n I must admit its giving tuff competition to the Warehouse cafe!!! The staff is courteous and polite n ready to attend u all the times. FOOD: so we ordered chilly chicken, hara tandoori paneer, cheesy spring rolls and dey came so fast..lol tasted nice!!!

So we waited to get the seats indoors because we wanted to sit inside and enjoy the cricket match in the awesome ambience of the place. After sometime we got the seating. We ordered shahi bhuna jeera murg tikka in starters along with some drinks. The murg tikka was superb. The chicken was so fresh and soft. It was the best chicken starter that I ever had. I loved this dish very much. The ambience is amazing. There is a concept of having to sit into separate vaults if you want. This is really attractive. The service is also good. It is the best cafe in connaught place. Thumbs up. Visit 2: Date-22th feb 2015 Today I went to this cafe and ordered spicy peri peri chicken and mint n lemon chicken along with some drinks.

There is lots of private dining space available here. Food is average as notthing that I tasted was worth the price attached to it. Tried Chilly paneer, chilly chicken, falafel, tandoori chicken, fried chicken. All of them was average and nothing stood out. Fried chicken was my least favorite and chilly paneer was the best. They serve bulk drink orders in huge test tubes which frankly is very inconvenient. Watermelon hookah was good. Service was good.

Rohan Pratap Singh,Rated The Vault defines its name to the core. A cafe built with a vision in mind of something different that did not exist before(at least not to my knowledge). Vault gives you a theme of something between Indiana Jones and Mummy Returns. With a light shade of brown their most dominating color. Artifacts like hour glass and hard bound books and chairs with a rustic look give you a unique experience. The lighting is dim and the private vaults just steal the show. If you happen with a large group friends do try the private vault. The bar area is also which amazes you with splendid seating arrangement. Outdoor seating is also available in case you want to get some fresh air. But I would suggest that you enjoy the feel of the inside. The staff is amiable and gives you your private space. Must try dish would be Butter Chicken Pizza which is thin crust and simply mouth-watering. The chicken strips with BBQ sauce are good but you may have had better. The brownie with ice-cream is average in plain language. I went there on a dry day so cannot comment on their drinks as of now. P.S.- The menu is also rustic brown in color thus their presentation is thorough Food -8/10 Ambience and staff- 9/10 Overall- 8/10,Rated 4.0,45,280,??

Ankita,"Rated It was a busy Sunday night when we choose to visit the-much-talked about Vault Cafe. I would highly recommend reservation if you want to get seated outside- which is an absolute must here. And thats because of the glorious Indian Flag view. The interiors inside dont disappoint either- the rustic, colonial interiors adds to the whole grungy ambiance. The fascinating bit is the inter-connectable vault spaces with huge metal doors that can be booked for private, larger parties. Since it was my friend and I, we choose to sit outside and got straight to ordering food. I started with the Watermelon and Khaffir Lemonade which was the ONLY downer of the evening. I was hoping fresh mint, khaffir leaves in my drink but I think they went for pre-made syrup. I will be honest; I wasnt expecting the food to be good. And the main reason was this is a drinking place; you will get okay-ish finger food. And god was I wrong. We started with the Beef Bulgogi. This dish is amazing- sweet, sticky, salty all-in-one. And it was delicious. The beef strips were tender and full of flavor, went so well with the curry and rice. There was no Kimchi on the plate, sadly. Would have definitely added a rounded, spicy kick. Next we got the curried prawn dumplings and these were super good too. The stuffing was just right, the curry powder in the prawns was up to the mark and the casing was nice and thin. Out of the dips- soy chilli was my favorite (obviously). The Vault Cafe Chicken Wings was next on the table. There are two types- BBQ and hot chilly. I loved the sweet, sticky BBQ while the friend enjoyed the spicy hot chilly. The wings were meaty, right-ly sized and juicy. Another thing we got was the Prawns Fresh Red Chilly. The prawns were plump, not chewy and not oily. The chilli was perfect. The coating was light and crunchy. The Mediterranean platter looked so tempting I had to order it. The dips were delicious. But even more were the Lamb rolls and the Sumac Chicken. The rolls were not greasy (again), had delicious veggie, minced lamb stuffing and went so well with tzatziki. Sumac on the chicken was liberal and thats why the meat had a blush-pink colour with an astringent, lemony taste, was charred nicely too. The Zatar fish was soft, had a nutty, lemon-y taste and went well the pita, tabbouleh and hummus. Lastly, we got the wood fired pizzas- the Pepperoni, Chorizo and the Herbivorous Delight. The non veg. pizza was amazing. The chorizo chucks were thick and oozed that spicy paprika oil on to the cheese--heavenly. The pepperoni had bits of black pepper, lifting the whole dish. The veg pizza was just as its name- full of fresh veggies. The base was not too thin, or dry. The base sauce could have been more though. We ended our meal with the Tiramisu. It was nice and thats comes from someone who detests coffee. The ladyfingers were soaked well in coffee, the filling was fresh and the chocolate was definitely there. Overall my evening was well spent. Our server Ranjit was always on his toes. The manager on the floor was attentive and alert. The prices are on the higher side- but worth it. The music after 10: 30pm changes from classic English pop to latest EDM and the floor is open to dance. letstalkfood.in",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Sidhant Ahuja,Rated I went to vault cafe on a frnds bday. Honestly there is nothing great about the place nor the ambience nor the food. With these prices there are many better options in cp. First of all we ordered the chicken nachos chat. The nachos tasted really old it wasnt even made nicely and there was almost no chicken. Then we ordered peri peri chicken pizza which was so spicy and the base was really dry. Pasta and Chicken wings were average.,Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Nimisha Arora,Rated I wanted to visit this placefor long. Finally got the chance to visit it with friends and colleagues last month in the chilling weather. I personally found vault cafe Asa nice and innovative concept based cafe'. Its even very easy to find as its in the center of delhi. Parking is also not a problem as you will get achance for valley parking at 100 bucks. Once you will climb the stairs you will see a huge vault gate as a entry and after an entry you will get a feel of a good lounge or a club in Delhi Ncr. Staff is also very supportive and attentive. We were 7 people in a group and visited it on weekend so it was jam packed. But after requesting the manager we got a table arranged for us in 10mins. It even has an open area which will give you a view of Cp. Food Quality is also good. Overall for me its a fun loving place. So you can definitely give it a try.,Rated 3.5,32,198,??

Plus, the view of the sunset, silhouetted by the waving Indian flag was a treat to the eye! However, what really disappointed me was the food at the cafe. It was, in my opinion as a tourist, well below average (definitely nothing in the league of the Big Chills in Delhi). We had called for a chocolate shake and a burrito - both of which did not quite go well with the set ambiance and mood. It tasted more like a roadside coffee shop's chocolate shake and the burrito was neither close to the ""real thing"" (pardon me for the cliche), nor was the cheese spared in the baking (who puts baked cheese on a burrito)! However, to be fair, as a starter the hummus and chickpea and potato fries were delicious and I'm sure their Lebanese options looked decent enough, but surely not their Mexican options and cold beverages! It can pass the first time visit mark as a good view on the terrace in Rajiv Chowk and definitely an excellent place to chill at sunset!",Rated 2.5,146,767,??

Then i had cabbage and tofu momos which was 'EUU' , in my whole life i had never seen green colour momos it was so lamentable and miserable . Then i had vault fruit full which was not at all a red bull flavour , it was just about watermelon. I had a pizza which was so oily and sticky , there was no taste of cheese in it . The chilly paneer was not bad but not good , it had a spicy flavour in it . For all taste bud i must say for food this place is not at all worth it .

They add a little dry ice in it for the theatrical effect. The cocktail can be chosen from a list including mojito and long island ice tea. But this is just about it. The food is below average and a little pricey. French fries, cheese balls and Chicken nuggets were non appetising. To top it all the veg pizza which was highly recommend by the staff The ""Herbivore Delight"", was nowhere near delightful. It was the worst vegetarian pizza ever.

Karan Puri,"Rated I recently went to review the newly opened Vault Caf well located in the f/n block area bang opposite PallikaBazaar. On my way, I checked with a few friends about the place, and most of them had heard about it as the next happening thing and it was also on their wish list. I was excited that I was the first to go there and experience it before they did. After climbing the lovely winding stairs to the second floor where vault caf is located, I noticed a vault door. The whole place is dimly lit, in tones of red, with walls sportinga brick look. What I liked about the place most was smaller seating areas for individual groups along the side, with entrances as if they lead to a tunnel. The place was packed which was great considering it was a Wednesday afternoon and chilly so only the adventurous few were sitting outside and you could see the national flag from the terrace. I was privileged to visit the place with my blogger friends from The writers Collective of India. We ended up sitting at one of the private vault rooms and Vicky ensured that we got to taste mostly all of the wide variety of items that were in the menu. The menu was itself a challenge. When I was going through the menu, I felt that it wasnt possible that they could actually keep such a global menu and do justice to it. for more details,visit my blog.",Rated 4.5,87,395,??

I mean, what shud one even say when no water or cutlery is served at the tables for 2hours. At the end, when the staff got tired of our insistence, we were given 2 mineral water bottles to drink from. How sweet! You can also do the same along with some shopping only by strolling in Palika Bazar. Why should one even bother the staff of the restaurant who are so happily chilling in the corners, gossiping and giggling. Not to mention, that the cutlery was served after a very long wait and that too was not enough for a big group of us and eventually we had to eat with our hands. When one of my friends asked the server to serve the dishes, he politely REFUSED to do so. I don't hold it against him since atleast he was polite about it. They claim to have valet parking available, I am yet to discover the same since I was flatly asked to leave since I could'nt find a place to park. Now , that I didn't like so much. Since it was an important dinner and I was already very late, I did it pay much attention. Before I forget, the portion sizes are minute as if they are serving to small sized people.

Service was good and fast. but the food quality was not up to the standards, we ordered baked vegetable and chilli paneer, chilli paneer was very spicy and baked vegetable was plain , then Indian starters were not available that day though they were their on the menu. then we ordered veg platter (which was good)and extra spicy chicken wing which were not spicy at all. prices are decent.",Rated 3.0,8,26,??
Isheeta Yadav,"Rated This place is a must visit with delicious food, good pricing,a bar, comfortable sitting inside as well outside with a pretty good view of Connaught place. What made this place stand out is that it's build like a bank vault, look out for the main entrance gate. They even have a private area resembling a bank vault. We'd ordered a Sizzling Peri Peri Chicken, Mint and Lemon Chicken, Butter Chicken Pizza and The Vault Special Five Spices Chicken Breast. The food was good. Pizza was just the BYDs butter chicken pizza. I liked the sauce in the vault special chicken breast. Mint and lemon chicken had good flavour. Definitely worth a try. Overall I had a good time.

Tapas Sadasivan Nair,"Rated Went to CP last weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday and someone recommended this for its unique theme. Loved the faux-Imperial British ambience - the vault we hung out in had these absolutely gorgeous maps of the world circa the 19th century. The menu is really extensive and has well, almost everything you could think of. We were not in the mood for anything major, so just ordered (quite!) a few starters and drinks.

Nidhi Paliwal | Www.spiceandstyle.com,Rated Cp has new cafes coming up literally every other day. Vault cafe has recently joined d league too. I always get tempted to visit newly opened places. So when I reached this place today and saw d vault like heavy golden door I got even more excited! But when I pushed d door open and saw d huge leather chairs and d darkness inside. It gave me a feeling of deja vu. It totally reminded me of warehouse cafe n townhouse cafe of cp. But yes in terms of natural lighting. Vault cafe is far better. All thanx to the big windows. It was dark but then d faces n d food was visible. I understand tat to go with d theme they have put up dim yello lights. But d cafe is spacious n u dun feel claustrophobic. They have 3 separate vaults whr upto 15-20 ppl can sit.. Good for a private party.d cafe turns into a lounge at night. So it cn be a good party place too. D bar looked nice. Now lets comes come to the service. I will give 2/5 for d service. Waiters literally ignored me n I had to shout at them for basic things like napkins n plates. I ordered bruchetta n they just placed d dish on d table wid no quarter plates or fork or knife. Disappointment. But i cnt forget to mention d manager was on his toes d whole time. He was making sure everyone is comfortable. Its a new cafe so i think they need more time to settle in. Food was good. Food i vil give 3.5/5. So overall I don't mind going there again n tryin out more food options.. But next time I wana in d evening so tat I cn appreciate d dim lighting more.,Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

VAULT CAFE is a new cafe that I visited recently and I was in a state of transfix. From the doors, to the private vault seating and a good roof space with huge fire lamps created a scintillating ambience . I ordered Cheese Nachos with Tuborg because I was late and had a time crunch, so had no time to order the main course or their specials. The servers were very polite and genuine.

Shivam Khanna,Rated Although the entrance to the cafe is a bit messy but once you enter it you are inside a vault. The interiors are nice with ambient lighting and sober decors. The theme obviously is well placed. We ordered both veg and non veg starters and main courses. The food was nice although not much spicy. Drinks were served well and in time. The complimentary nachos provided along with the drink was nice but sans any dip. And the dips provided with snack was not that good as you would expect. The music was being played on the right note with nice bass thumps. The seating outside is congested. So I would recommended to book indoor seating.

Alka Sharma,"Rated On this sunday, 11th jan 2014, me and 3 other friends of mine met. It was 6pm in the evening and we were looking for options to go to some cafe in CP which has Hookah as one of us, was craving for it. So Vault was chosen and we inquired the hostess downstairs about the table. We were told that there would be a waiting of 30-35mins but we still decided to go upstairs to wait. After climbing numerous flight of steps we reached our destination.And guess what, to my surprise, half of The Vault was empty. The entry gate is enormous n looks like Ducktales' Uncle Scrooge's money bin gate. The first impression that I got was that there is no coordination between the Hostess and the staff running the Vault upstairs. On our entry, we were seated on the table instantly. The entire place was dimly-lit, all red, it looked more like a shady dance-bar or something than a vault. I did notice seperate rooms with an entry door like the main entrance but its meant for minimum 10 people. There is an option of seating under the open sky but we chose to sit inside- yes we werent told about this option on entrying- it is something that we found later when we went exploring. There are diverse seating options- 1.at the bar -on bar stools. 2. On normal table and Chair 3. On high table and High chair 4.on couch 5. Out in the open. 6. Vault-seperate compartments for 10 or more. Being a cleanliness freak, I couldnt help but notice that our table was sticky and stained.The floor also was too dirty. It seemed that they clean the place with lights turned off. Now -the menu, too many options, all types of cuisine from all over the world but sadly everything was not available. It wasnt a time for dinner so we had to go for something light on tummy. We first chose the tandoori trail platter- veg n non veg, but it wasnt available before 7.30pm. So we had to opt for the mediterranean platter veg and the crispy platter-non veg. I am a recently turned vegetarian - this platter seemed like a good deal. It had falafel- which actually fell apart on the first bite to bits, potato fingers, pita bread was as thin as tortilla which was surprising, 2dips-tzatziki, hummus and tabbouleh salad. The quantity was very meagre but to my delight two of us shared the veg platter, I was quite full at the end of it. I had ferrero rocher milk shake with my meal- didnt like it much. Eating the chocolate is much better than drinking it as a milkshake. The falafel was very crispy but had no taste of its own. Tzatziki dip had a hint of cucumber but sadly neither hummus nor tzatziki was made properly. They lacked their distinctive taste- no olive oil, garlic,lemon juice in hummus and same for tzatziki- no distinctive flavors. These dips were just mayonnaise which were served to us - thanks to the dim-lights. *ambience- 3/5 *staff/service- 1/5 The waiters were not thorough with the menu and we had to ask for an extra hookah filter 6-7times and got it after 10mins. The hostess downstairs is oblivious to the actual happenings upstairs. *food- 2/5 *Value for money- 2/5 Hookah was priced at 750 + taxes which, I personally feel, was way too expensive. Quality of the portion served was less wrt the price. Elaborate menu but many items were unavailable. Infact,some of the beer brands were unavailable too which one of us wanted. We wanted to try some desserts but only 2 options were available- tiramisu n chocolate cake. It s no use having a book as a menu when the items available can be summed up on an A4 sheet.",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Tushar Gupta,"Rated A great place for large groups of people. As the name suggests, it's made in the shape of a vault, the main door also is in the shape of a vault's door, so all this was pretty innovative. Another cool thing was the private vault thing, which could accommodate around 10-12 people. I went to that, so it was all pretty nice. Antique furniture lightened up the place even more. The place is mostly dim, it suits the decor. It goes perfectly. They have a little outdoor sitting too, which of course can't accommodate a lot of people, and it's mostly full during the winter times so it's kind of hard to get a place outside, I never got one the 3-4 times I've been there as they have a no reservation for outdoor seating policy. The drinks are priced very decently. I like that about this place. Actually the overall pricing for food is also fine, it won't ruin your weekend. The sheesha is okay though, it doesn't last very long. And plus the service is terrible so they take ages to change the coal. Now coming to the food, the most important part. I've tried the chilly paneer, nicely marinated, crispy, and comes in a pan, which looks pretty cool. Then the smoked cheese balls were very regular, they tasted like the frozen ones you can get. One recommended dish would be the mushroom kurkure, its a delightful dish, would always make you want to have more of it. The best was the penne in white sauce, it was one of the best pastas I've had. Creamy as well as a little spicy. It had a little indian touch to it. They don't have separate sabzis that you can order. It's very convenient. They only have vegetable platters, in which you get a little bowl of that particular dish and 2 breads of your choice. They should just have a little more variety in the indian mains. But whatever they had was delicious. Especially the paneer pasanda platter. So there's no hassle of ordering the breads separately. Nice idea! The pizza was as good as the others. Crispy, cheesy, a little miser on the vegetable part but overall they were good. The only bad thing about them is the close to useless service. I know these guys have a lot of work at nights, but they are supposed to serve properly. First of all if you take the vault then you're screwed because there's no one to serve, I actually had to go out several times just to call someone to take the order. Secondly even if they do take the order, it takes them ages to complete it. Specially for sheesha, coal change is very important and they are very inconsiderate about it. I just hope they improve their service because it's huge drawback. Otherwise they're doing pretty well. A perfect place to go out on weekends, though I would suggest everyone to make reservations.",Rated 4.0,75,308,??

Tina,Rated I saw this cafe in the trending list of zomato. What caught my attention was its name and also the good ratings and reviews. So these things compelled me to try out this cafe. To start with ambience is good and they have tried to give this place a look of a vault in which they are somewhat successful. If you wish to sit inside the vault it will be good if you make prior reservation. Its fun to sit there if you have come in a group. Now the food. We ordered nachos wid cheese and keema pao in the starters along wid ginger aile. The food served was no doubt good. The quantity served was more than enough. It was so much that we couldn't have our main course. I also had veg red thai curry again it was really sumptuous. The drawbacks are the presentation of the food. I feel they need to improvise in this area. Also the waiters kind of got confused and gave us someone else's order and took a lot of tym in serving starters. All in all the experience was average.

The ambience was lively, with upbeat music playing. The whole cafe had excellent tinty lighting and spacious interiors. There were metal changes hanging around the pillars for effect. However our table for 2 was quite small. We had planned to have a quick bite and drinks. I ordered Vault Fruit bull, the most enticing mocktail i could find. My friend had a chocolate and nut shake. And the Sumak spiced Grilled Chicken was our final item. The service was quick and we received all 3 items in a few mins. The mocktail was unlike anything I'd ever tasted,so tangy and refreshing! The Shake was quite amazing too. Finally when the chicken arrived we knew it's a hit. Well cooked and soft, gingered with the right amount of spices, it was a delicacy. All this amounted to 750 but the taxes inflated our bill to exactly a thousand. Worth it. Recommended if you want a nice place to sit and eat with a large group.",Rated 4.0,17,77,??

Monil Singhal,"Rated The F/N block area in Connaught Place has become a foodie's delight, with a number of new restaurants opening up in the area. One of them, which has gathered instant popularity is Vault Cafe. Unlike most restaurants in Connaught Place, there is a long flight of stairs to get to Vault. The entry is a big, fancy, golden door, like one to an actual vault. The area beyond is huge, with both indoor and outdoor seating. The whole place is dimly lit, in tones of red, with walls with a brick look. What I liked about the place most was smaller seating areas for individual groups along the side, with entrances as if they lead to a tunnel. The food menu is quite varied, offering interesting dishes from Indian Street Food, Italian and Mexican, Asian and Continental cuisines. The drinks menu is expansive too, with lots of interesting mocktails and cocktails, along with the usual drinks. We ordered a Herbivores Delight Pizza, A Cheese and Salsa Nachos, Chicken Pad Thai, Chicken Quesadilla, Ginger ale and a pitcher of Tokyo Ice Tea (alcoholic). The Pizza was a nice, cheesy thin crust. The Nachos had a generous amount of cheese and salsa, just how I like it. But the Nachos themselves could be a little better. The Quesadilla was served with sour cream and salsa. It wasn't exactly authentic (which isn't the point in cafes anyway), but the filling was flavoursome and quite tasty. The Pad Thai was served with a wrap of egg around the noodles, which tasted great. The dish was a bit spicy but the flavours were good. The gingerale was very refreshing, though the taste of ginger was a tad too strong for me. The Tokyo Iced Tea was decent too. The service was extremely slow. Though the servers were polite and helpful, it took ages before they actually came - we had to ask 4-5 times just for water. We paid 3000 for 6 people, which is pretty decent. Overall, it is a great place to sit, eat and relax with friends, maybe the best in Connaught Place if you are looking to hang out with a group in a private ""vault"".

Bharat Kapil (JAY),Rated Me and my friends were very keen for our first visit at The vault cafe and I would definitely say that the ambience is superbly great and the concept is different which will definitely attract the visitors. The view from outside sitting is also mesmerising as we could have a direct look of the indian flag from there. The only disappointment was the taste of the food. I don't want to underrate this place as may be that happened because we were there in the most busiest week for the hoteliers (a day before NYE) Not to forget that the staff is very kind and helpful.,Rated 3.0,25,50,??
Neha Bathla,"Rated A routine check up on the trending places and this was the next hit. Cousin's bonding after long , I suggest this place considering the central location and regular check-ins of people in my list. Well keeping upto it's name - The Vault , it actually had these chambers with a retro feel, the doors as if you are in for some treasure hunt. Outside seating little too congested with too much of occupants. Anyhow, the ambience is worth appreciating. Menu has a good range ,to match upto taste buds of every kind of Delhite. My table wishes for Crispy Chilly potatoes - potatoes were way too chilly and lacked any other flavour of veggies or sauces , Chilly paneer - paneer tender , perfect taste of soya and chilly and just rightly stir fried veggies, Arrabiata penne ( my must try at every place) - pasta uncooked , the sauce was tasteless , spices totally blank though the garlic bread served was better the taste of garlic good but lacked the crispy part, Ice tea - nice blend of lemon and tea just the right proportion. Staff courteous enough though a turn off was refusal to start up tandoor inspite of the chilly evenings which definitely demands tandoori items. Pricing -moderate considering the location and space. Food needs to be worked upon for sure. And another advice would be better music , too dull for a cafe.",Rated 3.0,17,194,??
Mayank Gupta,Rated New cafe in cp..the decor and ambience of this place goes appropriately with the name..service is a bit slow ..food is also fine and reasonably priced..plus point is the music is not that loud and you can actually talk to your friends.. :),Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Harshit Sethi,"Rated This place is a kickass if you want a private vault to enjoy with your friends. The ambience of the place was amazing and the first thing that you'll notice will be the entrance gate. It is in the shape of a huge vault gate. It looks amazing. Talking about the food, they have huge variety in all sort of foods ranging from mediterranean to continental to indian and street foods. We ordered butter chicken pizza, peri peri chicken and vault special five chicken breast. Everything was good specially the peri peri chicken. This place also has huge variety in bar. The best thing about this place was that staff was really friendly. This place is worth a try.",Rated 3.5,24,314,??
Akhil Khandeparkar,"Rated This place is alive and always young. First thing you will notice is the ambience... It's kickass, I thought it will be vault themed... I wasn't expecting walking into an vault. The food is even better. I only tried finger food and everything I ordered was nice. It's an awesome place to hang with your friends. In the vault!",Rated 4.0,156,207,??

We ordered white sauce chicken pasta, and red sauce pasta, the white sauce pasta wasn't good at all, and there was barely any chicken in it. The red sauce pasta was quite good, the only thing which was good actually.

We had penne arrabiata & white sauce pasta, wood fired margherita pizza & a nacho platter with cheese with 18 pints of beer. All in all good vibe, awesome outside view, good seating arrangement, the staff was pretty courteous too (no pestering). The only thing I personally didn't like was, that they don't serve Miller. You have usual's like tuborg, kingfisher, Budweiser and corona etc. but about 6-7 in the evening they ran out of tuborg pints and even kingfisher drought beer, which sort of gave me an impression that they weren't ready to handle the number of people who came in that day. But if somebody does ask me hows the vault cafe, my answer will always be super! Cleanliness, hygiene factors are all good and let's hope they are able to maintain their standards in every way.

The nachos were good and the chilli chicken was way too spicy for me. I had the watermelon and kafir lime lemonade which was nice and refreshing. Later we ordered a 4 cheese Pizza and fries. The pizza was good too and the fries were usual. I'd go back another day and try something else as we stuck to the basics to be on a safer side.

We ordered the Herbivore's delight pizza and cheeze garlic bread, and i can assure you, your average dominos can serve 100 times better than that (i bet i can make that stuff better at home myself). For drinks, we ordered Iced Tea and a Vault Fruit Bull (which was iced Red-bull itself). Service was pathetic too! We had to find the attendants ourselves and place the order.

Abhirup Saha,"Rated The preamble to this lunch didn't start out alright. At work, when finding there's nothing to do, asked a friend to tag along for a lunch at CP, a blissful 25 kms away from our office, a luxury that one can afford only in the last week of December. She agreed and the plan was on. During the drive, she revealed that her big date is in Feb, and that well, came as a bad surprise considering she was an ex crush. Tight lipped, still smarting, I figured this could well be my last rendezvous with her, I mentally crossed off the outdoorsy places I'd been before- Warehouse, White Waters etc. This had to be special. Upon reaching CP, when my vehicle slowed to a crawl because of the traffic, I spotted the Vault. Bingo! This had to be the place, cause I'd heard so much about it. After struggling a bit to park, we made our way to it. One step into the Vault, and you won't wish to sit outside. The decor impressed me so much, I could spend a paragraph on it. But for your sake, I won't. Delightfully eccentric is all I will muster for you folks. The place wasn't really bursting at the seams, given that it was past 3 on a workday, so we found a very comfortable table. We aren't the best of hoggers, so fish fingers with tartare dip and a couple of beers would have been our choicest entres. Spotting Stout in the menu got us both excited (sigh) but the waiter kindly told us that the menu is for the press, we only get the choice of Corona or domestic. Corona it had to be, and in the meanwhile talk of Fork You (where I'd gone with her earlier) got our burger appetites rumbling. She opted for the Chicken with mushrooms and Caramelized onions and I took the good ol' American Cheeseburger with bacon. Mine was good, with an unimpressive bun. I took a bite off hers, and didn't mind that too. Overall, had a rather nice experience and will keep coming back. Especially for the effort they have put in decking up the place. Side note, it has got side vaults,kinda like private chambers for small groups, which can be a big draw.",Rated 4.5,134,473,??
Siddharth,"Rated New entrant in the list of dining places in CP, some open up do good business & stay while some close down to give way to new restaurants. Situated very close to the Palika bazar, the moment I reached there and asked hostess for a table. She said go up & wait for 15 mins. Upstairs there was no one to receive us & tell us where the table is or write down our numbers & guide us to start with the bar. One thing was a big disappointment, there is absolutely no coordination between the staff, they run around like chickens in a race & God knows what they are up to? Well after waiting for 5 mins I set out to find the manager/staff who would help me get a table. i spotted the manager and he looked confused as hell. He asked us to wait & disappeared. I set out again & caught hold of a waiter who guided us to start at the bar. He told us that table will be yours and requested us to be near the table as the guests generally take up the table the instant they spot one. After 15 mins of standing there we got the table ( thanks to their swipe machine as it wasn't working). Got seated and had to persistently remind the waiter of our order. Every time a new face greeted us & asked what did you just order? My rating of two goes because the food was cooked to perfection. I loved their barbecue onion rings & chicken wings. Pork chops too were delectable. My ratings are :- Food - 9/10 Ambiance - 8/10 Hospitality - 1/10 Value for money - 7/10 Suggestion for the management have a proper system in place & tend to customers on time, its a tough world out here your hospitality has to change for your survival.",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

I ordered crispy non-veg platter for starters. They have a great variety in their menu and since that day I was in mood to have mughalai so i order nihari gosht and keema mutton curry. The food was delicious and their presentation of food was very impressive. The meal was sumptuous and the food journey in the vaulte cafe was ended by chocolate brownie with ice cream.

And the portions served was quite big as I was full by my 5th bite. The peri peri dip and the mashed potatoes served with the dish were its highlights.

Joshua George,"Rated I wasn't expecting the place to be actually designed as a vault. You literally walk into a restaurant that resembles a vault inside out except for the balcony seating areas. There are private vault seating areas that can be reserved for a large group of people; it allows ample privacy and isolation from the crowd. The balcony walls and doors are made of red tinted glass that provide a warm reddish glow during the day. We ordered the continental main course - chicken Peri Peri and pork chops. I had come with a friend who's the Head of Department at a large food processing company - and this was one of the rare times she said that the food was good. Else it can get quite embarrassing as she usually insults restaurants quite loudly. Both the dishes were presented well on wooden trays. The meat was evidently fresh, well done and marinated. The pork chops constituted just the right amount of fat to be considered juicy. The dish was served with a side of cheesy mashed potato and steamed veggies. I ordered a long island ice tea with the meal which was pretty ordinary. But then what can you really do with a pretty straightforward cocktail. The drinks are a tad bit expensive but the main course dishes are worth the money. See the attached pics - one of them was taken without flash (thus the red glow) and the other one with flash.",Rated 3.5,23,293,??

Parul Nangal,"Rated Let's start with the ambiance, they have really worked hard on the interiors. One just cannot imagine that they'll have vaults inside. I loved the combination of yellow and pink color in the whole section. One just cannot easily forget the view from their balcony area. Their staff is polite and friendly. If I had to rate this place strictly on their ambiance then surely it would have been 4.5 on a scale of 5 but sadly, they forget to pay attention on the food. I went with my two friends and we ordered Penne Arrabiata, crispy platter, ferrero rocher shake and chocolate hazelnut shake. It was the worst Penne arrabiata I ever had! 3 bland spring rolls, 3 pieces of cottage cheese and 4 onion rings is what they call a platter along with three foul smelling dips. We just couldn't taste the dips. The shakes were fine in taste. There was nothing extra ordinary in the food menu. Honestly, I expected a lot from this place apart from it's ambiance (A hungry person will not eat the lovely ambiance, we need food for paet puja)I would have given it 2.5 but have to add 0.5 for the vaults & interiors, so it's a 3 on a scale of 5.",Rated 3.0,5,4,??
Rohit Elayathu,"Rated Now this place I must say is best of what I have seen till now. Ambiance, interiors, food, music and I can go on n on. This is surely the place you will remember for its awesome ambiance, its one of the best. Since its comparatively new place, I would say it is reasonably good on your pockets too. I went in with my whole chuddy buddy gang for a get-together, now this place like most other high-end places had separate rooms/sections other than the normal dining area, with huge vault shaped doors. Each separate room had fantastic interiors of its own, different from other, with awesome huge chairs n sofas to sit. They also had outdoor sitting with serene view of famous flag in central park. We opted for huge vault section. Also, the place had loud music suited for party mood, so we you are looking for a quite place , may be not a good choice. Food was delicious, full 10/10.

It's dark and very innovative and actually it looks like a vault only. There are some private vaults for groups also and outdoor seating adds to their ambiance. Didn't try much of their cocktails but yes tried my fav LIT and it was really good. In food, we ordered crispy veg platter which had cheesy spring rolls , chick pea and cheese potato fingers ( chef's speciality) and onion rings. The moment you have the spring rolls or the potato fingers, you will have a blast of cheese in your mouth and the taste was amazing. Also, the place is normally priced. We ordered 2 black labels and 2 LIT and some 3 starters and it all cost us only 3500 bucks.

Though everything was quite good I personally loved the cheese spring rolls and pizza. The staff is really kind and good at work. For main course we just ordered dal makhani and tandoori roti which too was quite good. Food was served hot and drinks were perfectly cold! Be it beers, mojito or 100 pipers.

Ordered just two starters..hummus with pita bread and dahi ke kebab. Hummus was tasty and dahi ke kebab were soft! Well the drinks are reasonably priced though. 6 pints for 600 and 12 for 850...mmm good! Hard liqour wasn't too expensive either. Won't burn a hole in your pocket!

Atul Ranjan,"Rated Visited vault cafe on Christmas. So let's start with the with the decor. The cafe has a big space with dark yet fascinating decor. They also have private spaces "" vaults "" which can be used for private gatherings, sounds interesting. So on first sight the place was impressive. Given it was Christmas, I had called them a good 8 hours in advance to check if they can book a place, I gave my name to the guy for booking and got a confirmation on same. To my surprise, I had to wait a good half hour to get the space to sit as they don't have prior booking option. So if you guys don't make advance bookings, you should tell that in advance. Now comes the service part, this is one place where they need to improve a lot. After we got the seat, we quickly made the order. I had to ask the guy multiple times to get our order. When we got food I had to remind him for the drinks that we had ordered along with the food. For sure, the guys need to be bit more attentive and responsive, good service makes a lots of difference. Now comes the food, and it was a mixed experience. We ordered BBQ chicken with sauce and it was pathetic. It was cold, rubbery and was not cooked to perfection. This created an instant doubt about the other items in menu. So we decided to try their pizza, and the pizza was a saving grace for them. It had a good taste, really thin crust and smokey flavor. Even the guy who was serving us, asked twice about the pizza, as if he was sure about the quality and taste:-) In dessert we ordered blueberry cheese cake but it was not available ( strange) ,so we got chocolate cake and it was good. So, overall it was a mixed experience. Except pizza and drinks, the experience was disappointing, may be I had a higher expectations from them. Hoping for a better experience on my next visit.

So me n my friend went in here in search of outdoor seating, but to our bad we couldn't get it. We took a corner area to sit which was light dim. The ambiance and interiors is pretty nice. Space and privacy is also present. We ordered chicken soup, chilli chicken, dal makhani , tandoori roti and beer. Soup and chilli chicken was nice. But they served us our main course along with starters only which obviously in such weather got cold by the time we started eating. Also on repeating the roti, service was very slow.

Divya Arya,"Rated Now this one's a special review as it's my 200th review and is of my first Zomato Meet. So last week I went to this place and yes, the ambiance is quite impressive. It's dark, so you might want to consider that. But it has all the elements of a vault. It has separate chambers too, like the one we sat in. The service of course was impeccable. Being a zomato meet, all of us were treated like queens and kings. The food was surprisingly good. I had the smoked cheese balls which were really tasty. The paneer tikka was good too. I loved the tofu wontons. For main course, I had tofu in black bean sauce which was pretty good. The paste in pesto sauce was alright, but it was over cooked. The four cheese pizza was extremely cheesy, just the way I like it. For desserts, I had the blueberry cheesecake and Tiramisu. I absolutely loved the tiramisu. But I'm not a huge blueberry fan, but the other bloggers loved the cheesecake. For drinks, I had the cosmo which was good and the chocolate shake, which I didn't like, wasn't chocolatey enough for me. Overall, this place is definitely worth a visit! countlesscravings.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Abhiram Bidwai,"Rated After missing the zomato foodie meet and having read the crazy reviews about it, I was really looking forward to visiting the place. Vault Caf, the new entrant in the Connaught Place restaurant scene. What exactly differentiates it? Let's see. Ambience - Going up to the 2nd floor, you are greeted by a heavy looking shiny bank vault door which welcomes you in the cafe. The name obviously defines the theme of the place. The place is huge. Very dimly lit, even in the day time. The red windows and the chains give it a dingy feel. I guess that's what these guys were looking to do. Private tables are given a neat touch adding a next level isolation level with fancy vault doors to them. The cutleries are nice. The bar is biiiig. (Stress on the word). The branding is spot on, the menu is probably one of the biggest I've seen for an all day cafe. Wow, commendable work guys. Seating is very very comfortable and the tables are spaced well. Most of the food was served on wooden platters. The cutleries were top notch. Music was very loud and it was difficult to talk to the person sitting opposite. Service - Servers were always smiling and super responsive. Kept a check on us, if we were enjoying the food. Solved the minor complaints. The food arrived extremely quick. Food - Vegetarian Mediterranean platter came with very good quantity. Falafel, potato fritters, pita, hummus, yogurt dip, salad. All of it tasted really good. Vegetarian quesadilla was a bit too Indianised, tasted well though. Can be avoided. Peri peri chicken was very well made, juicy chicken, flavourful sauce and rich potato mash. Spaghetti Arrabbiata was a bit too tangy. Had bottled beer, correct temperature, no complaints.

There are even special tables inside closed vaults which i suppose u hav to pre-book as they were all reserved when we went there. The outdoor ambience too is awesome with most of C.P. under your sight. Had tofu wontons and the taste was good.

Tulika Sharma,"Rated My first visit to Vault was unplanned. On seeing Nandos board in cp we planned a visit there. After reaching there we realised Nandos was still under construction and so we decided to settle for vault unhappily. But vault amazed us with its exclusive ambience and food. And this time my visit to vault was for the #zomatomeetup and I was looking forward to it. On reaching there I was escorted to second floor of the restaurant and one private vault was specially booked for the meetup. They have put a lot of effort in setting up the place and have done justice to it. It has three different seating options the indoor sofas, outdoor arrangement and the private vaults. As soon as I settled the drink menu was put into my hands and I ordered cosmopolitan. It was one of the best cosmo I have ever had the vodka cranberry and lime complementing each other and intoxicating you just in time. A special food menu was prepared for the meetup and we had a chance to try it all. The food kept arriving from start till the end and the table was always full. The staff deserves special mention for their hospitality throughout the meetup, paying attention to each and every guest invited. Coming to the most important part the FOOD! Appetizers Chicken wings with BBQ had a great smokey flavour in it. Smoked cheese balls- the deep fried cheese balls with loads of cheese exploding in your mouth...simply delicious! Chicken cheesy spring rolls- it was just filled with cheese and I had to ask again to make sure it contained chicken. It definitely needed more chicken. Stuffed tangri kebab was an innovative dish with minced chicken filled inside the chicken leg and was cooked perfectly I didnt try the tofu wontons and mint chicken. For the main course Basil pesto pasta arrived first which was soggy and had an excess of pepper in it to spoil the flavour. Tawa mutton masala the gravy was spicy but flavour of raw tomato was a little overpowering and the mutton pieces needed more cooking. Beef bulgogi stood out in the main course. Marinated beef in black bean sauce served over rice was an array of flavours and it tickles your taste buds. Sizzling peri peri chicken was marinated chicken breast coated with peri peri sauce and it was succulent and juicy. I just left when the desserts were being served and surely missed it. Thanks to #Vault and #TeamZomato for the lovely evening. Overall from my experience vault is a must visit place for its one of a kind ambience and for their signature cocktails and appetisers. Its a beauty to watch the flavoured air cascading down on your drink. My personal favourite are vault 1857, old fashioned & cosmo. Definitely going back soon to enjoy a pleasant sunny day and their outdoor seating.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

We ordered: Peri peri penne pasta- It was one of their signature dish and it truly stand on being their specialty. If you love spices/chilly you will love it. Chickpea and potato fingers- It was like any another cutlet. Nothing special. Not worth having. Cocktail- Raspberry sizzle. Though it says it contains sugar syrup .

Manpreet Singh,"Rated Went to this place for a lunch on 20th December, 2014 with 2 friends. The lady at the entrance told us that a table has been arranged and we went inside to sit. However, no table was available and the manager asked us to wait. After waiting for good 15 minutes, I went to the manger and asked him where is our table and why are we being made to wait if no table is available. The extremely rude, inhospitable manager told me that no table is available. When I asked him why didn't he tell us when we entered, the manager told me that its not his responsibility to tell about which tables are available and told me to go for lunch somewhere else, pointing towards the lift. His attitude left me extremely puzzled as I had read great reviews about this place. I told him that I want to submit a feedback and in his foolishness told me that I am the manager of this place whom will you complain to and submit my feedback to. I somehow managed to get the contact details of the senior manager after the manager realized that all other customers were looking at him and he had got himself into a mess. I narrated the entire episode to the senior manager (Yogesh) who was extremely courteous and patient. He assured me that this should not have happened at the first place and will not happen again. I refused to have lunch at this place even though a table was made available for us immediately after. I hope the management learns how to serve its customers and this won't happen again with any other customer.",Rated 1.0,1,53,??

And secondly the ambience of this place with those massive vaults for private sitting and the red light and the songs played there is highly impressive. And the best point to be noted. Please check the bar menu.. The time u enter this place no one will have an idea that the rates are so lower in comparison to other bars in Cp..I think one can easily skip 'my bar' for the kind of atmosphere here.

The Feast That's Life,"Rated Vault cafe had been on my wishlist ever since it opened primarily because of its innovative theme of decor, and thanks to the Zomato team, which organized the #Zomatomeetup here, I was able to visit it. This place is located right at the entry of the inner circle if you're coming from Janpath. The lift takes you up to the 2nd floor where this place is located and opens up to a dimly lit room with chains and locks on the walls, to give the feel of a vault. This place also has private dining rooms in the shape of vaults, and one such vault was booked for us foodies. Zomato sure knows how to make you feel special, as I felt no less than a VIP from the time I entered to the time I left. As soon as I told the person at the entrance that I was there for the Zomato foodie meet, I was greeted with the brightest smile and was escorted to the vault that was booked for us. And as soon as I sat down, the food and drinks just kept coming non-stop. We had a special menu for the meet, and I tasted almost everything on it. The tandoori hari mirch paneer tikka was nice, but wasn't even close to as spicy as it sounds. The smoked cheeseballs is a good option for vegetarians, with cheese oozing out of the crumbed deep-fried balls. The mint and lemon chicken didn't have the flavours as pronounced as they should have been, lending the chicken a tad bland. The chicken wings with barbeque sauce were delicious, and I simply loved the sticky bbq sauce. The stuffed tangri kebabs were chicken drumsticks stuffed with minced chicken and spices. Though a nice concept, the thicker parts of the chicken were a bit undercooked. Now coming to the mains, the basil pesto pasta was just average. What was not average though, was the beef bulgogi. It was a spectacular dish of slivers of beef in a black bean sauce, on top of a pile of steamed rice- a must have dish here. Equally good was the peri peri chicken- succulent and juicy chicken breasts, lathered with a delicious peri peri sauce, served with a side of sauteed vegetables. The tawa mutton masala had a nice gravy, but the mutton pieces were a bit chewy. In drinks I had a chocolate shake, which was quite nice. Unfortunately, I had to leave early and couldn't stick around for desserts. But it was a wonderful evening with great food, and great hospitality by the zomato team, with hopefully more such meetups to come.

Shweta Khurmi,"Rated This place was always on my list since it started courtesy the food groups. Got a chance to visit this cafe last sunday. Was very excited to try this place. We asked the person at the desk for a table for two and enquired about the waiting time . To our surprise we were given a go ahead right away. The ambience, the vibe and the decorations were really amazing. Took our seats and started deciding the order. Then came the shock. One of the staff menbers cane to our seat and ask us how are we seating on that seat. The question was completely unexpected so the reply was a casual ""What"". Then the person told us that a waiting is going on and we should before taking the seats. I tried to make him understand that we already checked with his colleague and thats why we are sitting here but the person was not ready to hear anything. Also suggested him that we can shift to the terrace area as there were few vacant tables. But we got really pissed off when we were told that we will have to wait in aby condition and was asked to go out of the cafe. This kind of hospitality was really unexpected and disgusting. You just cannot ask your guests to move out of the cafe when one of your colleague asked them to take that seat. First impression is the last one. Surely never going to this placd ever again. Its off my list for now and forever. P.S. - gave 2 rating for the ambience",Rated 2.0,14,46,??

Pragya Agarwal,"Rated Vault cafe was thoroughly disappointing. The portions of starters was really tiny for some good bucks. We ordered onion rings, wild mushroom bruschetta and french fries for starters and a hawaiin pizza, mutton gravy meal and piri piri chicken. The starters were good on taste but an absolute upset on portions. The main course was horrible. The chicken was under cooked and mutton was simply too hard to chew or even get off the bone. The pizza was average.*to top this, when we asked the helper that the chicken is under cooked and could it be replaced he came back saying the chef says it is fine. We said okay cook whatever portion of chicken that you can from the plate(about half of it was left). And they returned the same thing with more piri piri sauce (I swear we all prayed to god that the chef didnt spit in it :-P) For desserts we ordered a tiramisu and blueberry cheesecake both of which tasted really average and were tiny slices again . For alcohol we ordered 12 shots rum and 3 pints of beer kingfisher ultra. We ended up feeling highly dissatisfied with the food in terms of the taste, quantity and the presentation was a major screw up. It was as if no one gave a rat's a** about the presentation. The cafe is huge and has ample seating area and that's the only plus point. We were a group of five and our final bill was 4K.. Final verdict: average place with below average food. Avoid at best!!!",Rated 1.5,4,107,??
Gurjot Singh,"Rated So this was not an ordinary vault, this was a storage packed with foodies, conversations about food experiences and a get together which was worth every penny! #zomatoMeet it was! What interests you about this place - is obviously its chick ambiance, 4 private areas for groups and good music! Coming to the food- in appetizers , I had.. 1)stuffed tangri- minced chicken filling in the chicken leg ! The chicken was cooked to perfection, however since I came late, I had it wasn't that hot, by that time, so I really couldn't enjoy the very first appetizer! 2) chicken wings with BBQ: just the way they should be! Served with extra BBQ sauce , that was a thing of amazing taste! 3) pokchoi and tofu wontons: I have never tried wontons like that before! Everywhere else, where I had them before, either they were oily, or there was an issue with the stuffing! But this one was a surprise package! Decent stuffing and not at all oily! Its a reco for vegetarians! Banana and vanilla shake was good enough !unlike the regular shakes, I didn't find it that heavy ! Coming to the mains: 1) their Korean speciality Beef bulgogi was a darling dish! Amazing flavors, perfectly cooked beef! It was the dish of the day for me! 2) sizzling Peri Peri chicken : it was amazing in the first bite, but the other piece I took, was completely dry! Need to marinate the chicken even for more time to avoid the dry chunky chicken ! 3) fussili in white sauce pasta: it was little bit soggy! I didn't enjoy it that much! Coming to the main treasure of the vault which just gained it extra points is the dessert part! Blueberry cheese cake : just tip of an iceberg! One of the most delectable cheese cake I ever had! Tiramisu: this Italian dessert means '' pick me up''! And was so tempting that anyone could love it in the very first bite! Its a must try! Great coffee flavor! Overall, it was a great experience! And I would definitely visit again to explore their exceptionally vast menu! Thanks #zomato and the team for inviting! It was great to have food with fellow foodies!

Rishabh Bhatnagar,"Rated Had the opportunity to visit this restaurant through an invitation to the Zomato Foodie Meetup. It was really well organised and a lovely night out. The first thing is the approach. There is a touch button lift to take you upstairs which automatically gives you an insight into the place you're visiting. You're greeted by a huge door, done with loads of chains and gears to make it look like a vault door (of course). The restaurant is huge and the menu is quite comprehensive, I couldn't really find a reason for them to have 'Cafe' in their name. The ambience is ideal for couples, families, parties, get togethers. The music isn't too loud so as to overpower your conversation but just right. The lighting is apt as well. Team Zomato had booked a small dining room for us and we tucked ourselves in as the food made it's way. Virgin Mojito: Nice, refreshing but a tad too sweet. Smoked Cheeseballs: This was lovely. Smoked cheese rolled up in a ball and done with a breadcrumb style covering. And obviously, deep fried. Pok Choy and Tofu Wontons: These were delicious. Even though I didn't really get the Tofu a lot, the Pok Choy did the trick for me. Chicken Wings: Lovely. Smoked and saucy and finished with yum barbecue sauce. To die for. Mint and Lemon Chicken: This was passable. The flavours were too subtle and it felt like eating normal fried chicken. Stuffed Tangri Kebab: This is innovative. Minced chicken was stuffed into a normal Tangri Kebab. The first 2 bites I took were good, but it was undercooked in the inside. Chicken Spring Rolls: Here the chicken was negligible and the cheese was the overpowering flavour. Mains Basil Pesto Pasta: This was good. But a little less pepper would have been better. Tawa Mutton Masala: The gravy here was good but the mutton piece that I got was undercooked. Naans: Crunchy at the ends, soft and buttery in the middle. Probably perfect. Peri Peri Chicken : The chicken was succulent and the peri peri too was good. Beef Bulgogi: This was basically slivers of marinated beef served upon a bed of rice and black bean sauce. It tasted good. Desserts: My favourite time of a meal Blueberry Cheesecake : Probably one of the best ones I've tasted. The cream cheese was perfectly set, the cracker base was buttery and blueberry topping was great. Tiramisu: This was great as well. The fingers were well soaked in rum and the actual Tiramisu had the right amount of coffee. The service throughout the meetup was amazing with no glass going empty for more than 10 seconds and the same for starters and mains. I had a lovely experience at Vault Caf, thanks to Team Zomato!

Vasundhra Gupta,"Rated The first feeling I had when I entered the place - woah! Even though I'd seen tons of pictures of the caf before visiting, no photographs could do the justice that your naked eye will. I would like to congratulate Vault Caf for the beautiful and well-maintained place, and would further like to appreciate their kind and attentive staff, who keep their smiles from the moment you enter up until you stepping out after your meal. :) I was invited for the wonderful Foodie Meetup organised by Team Zomato, and was privileged to try out a unique menu (vegetarian) - * Cheese balls - 5/5 Who doesn't like melted cheese? And who doesn't like fried food? Two of the best things combined, and they were done well, with the cheese still oozing and melting with every bite. * Tofu Wontons - 5/5 As a tofu lover and fan of Chinese food, I was impressed with this restaurant's take on their crunchy wontons and tofu. Would definitely recommend, as long as you don't mind tofu. * Paneer Kebabs - 4/5 They were well barbecued but lacked a bit of marinating, as the flavours weren't as dense as I'd like them to be. Nevertheless, an enjoyable and wholesome starter for the paneer lovers! * Virjin Mojito - 3/5 Just the right flavour, except accompanied by an overdosage of ice, leading to the dilation of my drink after a few minutes of it sitting around. Cost cutting measures eh? I'd give this mocktail a 5/5 if it weren't for the bland effect from ice, so maybe you could alert your waiter beforehand. * Paneer and naan - 3/5 If paneer isn't soft, it makes every vegetarian think they're eating something non-veg. And such was our case! I was quite surprised that the cubes wouldn't dice even with a fork and spoon working together. Quite strange, considering the gravy was pretty good. Even the naan served wasn't soft, and had more of a crunch to it. Maybe it was intended to be that way, because none of the others seemed to mind. Nevertheless, it wasn't upto the mark for me. * Tofu with Black Bean Sauce and Rice - 3/5 A pretty average dish, with a marinated sliver of tofu, over rice and black bean sauce for gravy. Nothing worth raving for, in my opinion. * Pasta - 3/5 Again, another average preparation that was overloaded with black pepper! It was an alright item, which amongst the 3 main course dishes was still probably the most acceptable. But we've all had better pasta than this, even at home. * Blueberry Cheesecake - 5/5 SCRUMPTIOUS!! Very moist, melting in your mouth and highly delectable for the sweet tooth. I'd go back again for this dessert, if I did. Final Verdict Love the service and ambience, and would definitely like a chance to try their outdo seating arrangement. It's probably a place to go for appetisers, drinks and a dessert, but I'd totally steer clear from the main courses! I would say the menu is on the pricier side, but it suits the service and fine dine kind of experience you take away at the end of your evening. I also really appreciate that they have a lift to reach their restaurant, since otherwise it's crazy climbing 2 flights of stairs. Sidenote - it's a little too dark for pictures, unless you've got a great camera.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

As we entered the place,it was very much divergent in comparison to the other restaurants.I mean it in an optimistic sense.It was very attractively emblazoned by the vaults.They even had many private sitting zones which was again very appreciative.This place had an outdoor sitting too but since we went in the afternoon we decided to sit inside since the weather was not that impressive. So now coming straightly to the food.We had ordered two dishes.Vada pav and noodles along with veggies in mixed sauce.The vada pav was not that great.The bun was very rough too.The latter dish which were noodles were very delicious like ''delicious'' can be said as an understatement. It was EXTRAORDINARY.It was LUSCIOUS.The noodles were so smooth that they themselves were gulping through our mouth.I was very much satisfied with this dish.Moreover the sheesha was also lovely.I would love to suggest this place to each and every person.No doubt it was Mind Refreshing.",Rated 4.5,2,44,??

Varun Dubey,"Rated This is amongst the newest places in CP so I decided to go here with my buddies. As you enter, you will notice that they've put some effort in their interior design. They have various seating options available. Indoor seating, outdoor seating and seating for private gatherings in one of their bank like vaults. Their bar looks nicely spaced and set. Coming to the food/drinks: Sizzling Peri Peri Chicken. This comes coupled with a garlic bread slice and a mashed potato. The mashed potato was useless for me since I don't like it anyway. The chicken was cooked properly and was spicy for sure. The chilli dip that comes along is also very good just incase the spices don't strike you at first. Chilli Paneer. Nicely cooked. Not very spicy, but tasted good. Nachos with cheese. Decent quantity. Lots of cheese and salsa. A good starter here but there are way better options. Dal Makhni Platter. The dal was just perfect. Creamy and consistent. One could easily tell that butter was used. It wasn't very thick and gooey which was the best part. Good quality and decent quantity. Paneer Makhni. Good taste and nicely prepared. The only issue here is the number of paneer pieces. They seem a little less when one is sharing this. Had to re-order this one. The Crispy Platter (veg). The Crispy Platter (non veg). Both the platters are amazing. Come with three different dips. The highlight here: Spring Rolls in both the platters. All the dishes were fresh and tasted good. Definitely a must try. Home made ginger ale. Strong taste of ginger and freshly made. A good non-alcoholic drink choice. Banana Oreo Shake. This was just plain disappointing. No taste of Oreo at all. It was like having a normal banana shake at home. Brain Freezer (sheesha). The sheesha/hookah was good. No problems here. Long Island Ice Tea (pitcher). Not sure what happened here. I could only taste the rum inside. It's possible that they diluted it too much or used less ingredients. They should check up on this. Overall: A nice place to hangout. Food is generally good. Staff is friendly and quick at service. Low-medium volume music till the evening. Not sure about the night. Their name is in relation to the concept.

Mayukh Datta,"Rated Went there for lunch and we sat outside in the Delhi winter, feeble sunlight lit terrace of the Vault Cafe. At night, it could be a very interesting place to see the tricolor flag fluttering on the right and noisy traffic below. The Vault Cafe is another one trying to get the terrace lounge concept on to get sticky, faithful patrons in a reviving Connaught Place food scene which will get very competitive very soon. Below is the Nandos CP outlet and the Domino's and Dunkins pair isn't far too. The menu is very eclectic and it seems an attempt to be OK in all cuisines, specialise in none. Mediterranean, SE Asian, Indian, Continental, North & South American and breakfast menu. Why did they leave Africa out? The place inside has a lounge style and some private sitting areas which have a vault gate to enter in. Seems difficult to enter and exit so can't imagine how a server is able to manage an uneven floor with trays in his hand. The floor manager looked barely in his late teens who met us wearing a suit and hands in his pocket with a callous attitude and stern face. The Mediterranean platter was actually a Lebanese platter. The falafel was dry and cold. The pita bread was hard and not great. The chick pea and potato fingers were warm and soft. The hummus and other dips were v nice. We then ordered two Indian veg platters - the dhaba daal was yellow daal which was very very good. It was tasty, laced with ghee and it stood out, pretty thick too. The paneer makhani was flat, run of the mill red tomato gravy with couple of pieces of white, uninterested, revolting pieces of paneer dropped into it. Not worth it at all. Both as platters came with hot bread, naan and lachcha parantha. Hot, flaky and very nice. Overall, they have spent money on interiors than the kitchen.

I loved the vaults they have created to keep your memories safe :D ! I chose to sat on the outdoors with my friends. It well so soothing to be sipping a beer outdoors watching the sun turn red and set down! We ordered Nachos,Some chilled beers and Falafel and Hummus!

Varun Mahajan,Rated This place has invested a lot in the theme. The ambience is great but service is equally poor. The food in itself is fine. Tried peri peri pasta which I feel had a great taste.

Bhavya Gupta,"Rated A new place in the heart of the city with a great ambience both inside and outside. It's a huge place and serves all that we could think of. However, herbal hookah is something that one can avoid since its not value for money. Food and its quantity is value for money with variety in the platters both veg and nonveg. We tried the tandoori and the crispy platters both veg and they were good. The wood-fired pizzas need slight improvement. Looking forward to tastier pizzas next time. The seating is designed in the manner of vault which justifies the name of the place itself. Its a must visit esp in the current weather of Delhi.

Lav,"Rated Three old school friends planned on a reunion and good old Connaught Place was where we all met up. Vault Caf was picked up after 20 minutes of wondering around and deciding where we should start our good old gossips. This place has the mood going for it all right. Dim lights greet you then the big vault door opens up into the large central area lined up with several tables and the bar on one end. Then they have these vault sitting areas which can be used by a large group or family. On the lighter side I was wondering as to what would happen if someone were to be locked up inside one of those. Then again, as long as they keep serving food, I guess the prisoners would be ok. Lastly, this place also has an open sitting area and we did not go for it since yesterday was the first attack of Dilli ki Sardi this season. AMBIENCE Thumbs Up. Unfortunately for me the good things ended here. Why? 1. The menu lists 14 kinds of beer available. However I was told that only Kingfisher, Kingfisher Ultra, Heineken and Amstel are available. This does not seem right. I mean I get the supply issues with 2-3 brands but you dont have 10 of them? If you cannot manage supply then dont even list them just have 4-5 so at least customers dont feel disappointed. I wanted Erdinger by the way and ended up with Amstel. Also, one of my friends went for the beer by tap and it was bad. 2. BBQED Onion Rings were reeking with oil. You deep fry a dish and then serve it in this state? The fact that the oil did not go off indicates some serious flaws in the cooking process. This was an atrocious dish. 3. The other starter we called for was Chickpea and Potato Fingers. We got something but Im quite confident it was not what we ordered. They were fingers all right but I could not figure out the chickpea. All I was getting was cheese. And then this was served with tartar. My personal take is that cheese and tarter dont sit well. They could have just given ketchup. The fingers were not bad though. We were high so just finished it. 4. My other friend ordered Spaghetti Aglio Olio. While I was waiting for my burger to come, I did have a bite. It was absolutely bland. Then again perhaps its meant to be as I dont know the technicalities of this pasta but there was nothing given on the side oregano, chili flakes or Tabasco. I was actually surprised he ate it this bland. 5. My Veg Chili Bean Burger was the only saving grace. This was a good burger. Patty was well done to the best possible point and I could see and taste my beans very well. The fries on the side were lovely and not reeking with oil (unlike the onion rings). But here also their poor service standards were displayed no ketchup or mustard served. I mean you always bring along ketchup and mustard when you serve a burger. Like I said we were high so did not bother to ask. Poor poor service. The server had no idea of what was happening and was not able to make recommendations as well. Vault Caf as far as I am concerned, you need to get your game up big time. Not happy PS - Sheesha was ok.",Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Prateek Sharma,"Rated The concept is truly mind-blowing. If you find warehouse cafe a lil overpriced and now brimming with crowd every evening, town house cafe too dark and again, full most of the time, then give vault a visit. Since its new in CP, it has not attracted much attention yet (as compared to the above two listed) so you will easily get a table for 7-8 people or a CHAMBER. Yes that's the USP of this new party hostspot. ambience- they have 5 private vaults/ chambers and if if you are more than 5 then you will get a chamber without any delay or wait. the seating area is huge in front of the dj and the vaults are just adjoining . the terrace is almost packed with people all the time, specially in this weather from where you get a perfect view of F block and the large INDIAN flag . the lights are not too bright/dim and neither the place looks tacky with multi coloured lights. RED it is. the place is very huge and comfortable. FOOD- excellent. we just tried starters so next review will include main course as well. we ordered multiple servings (2 each non veg and 3 each veg) of the following: reshmi malai tikka- superb. i recommend this. soft well marinated chicken served with green chutney which had a really different taste. tandoori chicken- wasn't extraordinary. chilli panner- it was steaming hot and was awesome. chilli paneer- for veggie lovers, this is my recommendation. paneer tikka- i have never seen this particular dish being prepared differently anywhere. even it tastes same but they coated it with some spices so, thumbs up. honey chilli potato- very crispy. not too spicy or sweet. just perfect quantity was highly satisfactory. spring rolls- very thin, very crispy, not too much stuffed and delicious. DRINKS- idk why my bar is so overhyped. i have been to all the branches of my bar in hauz khas and cp and you end up paying somewhat similar price anywhere else ..except for beer. that's just one thing that's astonishingly cheap over there. but then the crowd, service and ambience all are pathetic so it's better to shell out a lil more. vault offers a great and exhaustive bar menu. we ordered- 100 pipers- 12 shots 30ml absolute vodka- don't remember how many :P 4 pints of kingfisher beer (they don't serve budweiser, dissapointed) 3 vault fruit bull mocktail- pathetic. too sweet. tastes like medicine mixed with sugar syrup. 3 red bulls and 2 bottles each of soda and coke. service- very quick and impressive although they were in a rush maybe because of the crowd brimming in after 11pm. i asked one to serve the starters many times but he just didn't pay heed. we made a mess out of the place beacuse it was a celebration and a group of 11 guys! but they were polite and quite helpful throughout. ended up shelling out 10k but it was totally worth . on a scale of 5- food- **** ambience- ***** service- **** cost- *** will definitely recommend and visit again.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

I think they have a very good hand in making North Indian food as we ordered Barra Kabab which was cooked to perfection, slightly spicy and Nihari Gosht which was again finger lickin'. But the downside was the Mediterranean cuisine which we ordered and was not that up to the mark... It was supposed to be a Vault Cafe 5 Spices Grilled Chicken with Saffron rice... But the chicken was bland and I was not able to taste any of the spices... Saffron seemed to be just dipped in yellow water because there was neither any aroma or taste to the rice.. Ambience wise it was nice... With okay music playing... They definitely need to change the DJ though...

We started off with a Spaghetti in Red sauce, which was excellent. Usually pasta sauces are more cheese than tomato, not this one. Afterwards we moved on the the Chilli Bean Burger. Nothing great about this one, have had better. Their best dish was the Pokchoi and Waterchestnut Dim Sums. Amazingly done and served with chilli and soy sauce. Drinks - it was fine till beers but as soon as you move to cocktails, it all goes downhill. The proportions were off in the LIIT and some other cocktails had too much salt in them.

I asked for shwarma roll. That was also not available. However pizza was the thinnest paper pizza we ever had. Pasta was so so. Platter was very very basic . We ordered garlic bread and a burger . Garlic bread was the most yukky thing i had that eve. Burger came after 35 min. Poorest service. I m hardcore non veg so tried ordering chicken wontons. That too came after 20-30 min.

But sadly the food disappoints once tasted. I went there last week with family and tasted every kind of cuisine but none could match the standard which is set by similar restaurants. To start with vegetarian, we ordered smoked cheese balls and Veg Quesadilla... Both these were extremely bland and tasteless. Only face saver was pineapple salad which was like a normal tikka. On Non veg... Mediterranean platter left you unsatisfied as portions were extremely small as compared to prices... All mutton items were out of stock at 6 pm which made us thinking ..... Also the waiter had very little knowledge of menu and his personal recommendation Chicken breasts in white sauce were totally bland.

The outside section has the most amazing view of the Indian flag at central park. I ordered the fresh chilly prawns and Beijing steamed fish which tasted really good , however I do hope the portions were a bit bigger. This was followed by the Tenderloin steak with soya vegetables which was also very good. I also got to taste the Mutton Nihari which was a disappointment , maybe cause no one can recreate this master recipe. The butter chicken pizza tasted very different.

Food was average-good with modest prices. Hukka could have been a notch better. I would have rated it 3.5 but .5 deduction is solely because of lack on part of staff management.

Nabanita Dutta,"Rated If only ambiance could satisfy your taste buds this place would have got 5 stars from me. This is a new food joint in Connaught Place. Hungry and eager to find a multi-cuisine restaurant, searching on Zomato vigorously my partner found out Vault cafe for a family dinner. Initially we didn't see the outdoor sitting area, later we saw and decided to seat there. The decor and the ambiance outside is awesome. Then came the drinks and the balance of the alcohol and liquor weren't really perfect in Long Island Iced Tea. The triple sec was bit over powering. However the starters were brilliant. Both the Indian kebab platter and the Lebanese platter was finger licking good. We were hugely disappointed when we fond they do not serve tenderloin steak in spite of having it and highlighting it on the menu. Same thing happened with the pork. Disappointed, we offered for tenderloin burger and roasted. chicken breasts. Both were bit overdone hence, not good in taste. However on the other hand, parents opted for Indian (chicken korma and butter nann). Korma was really good and tasty. The stuffs are not yet habituated with the menu and when we crossed them about a few details of the food they were pretty lost. Even though the ambiance was great, foodwise and hospitality and professionalism need a lot of improvement there.

Nupur Agrawala,"Rated So after reading so many good reviews I decided on trying this place out. Even the menu seems very vast and interesting. We tried/ordered a variety of vegetarian dishes :- Veg omelette - we were told that eggs weren't available after 30 mins of ordering.. Tandoor platter - good nothing great, had asked for no mushrooms, yet they put the mushrooms starter.. Vada Pav - the best dish in our entire lunch Veg Quesedilla - Bad bad bad. Super disappointed. Veg salt n pepper - Very average Herbivores pizza - second best dish of the day. Fresh n crisp Ginger ale - refreshing and good Extremely limited deserts menu. Was told that they will be updating their menu soon. Portions were pretty small as compared to the prices. Good ambience. Very very slow service. Overall a very average experience.",Rated 3.0,34,363,??

They have a sitting outside which will surely rock during this winter season and they even have separate party rooms which is great for a group of people who are looking to celebrate. Food is decent and menu is huge but was expecting more as there was nothing so different as compared to other joints, so was little disappointed and even my friends who were there. Drink options are good though and overall price is ok as well. Happy hours should be introduced for better sale and will be expecting a better taste on my next visit.",Rated 3.5,20,61,??

Shruti Garg,"Rated Before writing my review I'll mention it has opened few weeks back give it some time. As you enter there is a giant vault gate amazing, whole set up is really nice only of they could work more on the lighting. Sperate vault spaces for family or group of friends is nice. It also has a outdoor seating which is great. Now comes the real part, food which was average not disappointed not over to top impressed. They went a bit overboard with suggesting classic drinks with a twist. I expected it to my repeat order but A. They didn't have two drinks I ordered first. B. The one I ended up ordering was pathetic which was Caiprioshka with kaffir lime & blood orange. There was no alcohol in it, tasted like rasna. I gave it up and ordered JD that's classic. Any way their feedback form had no box for rating bad which is just being not fair. I hope this place improves on as there is a lot of work done on its interiors and locations. 0.5 more just for awesome music and playing my song repeat three times. Also I have a question to the manager, who gives tequila shots without lemons??

Its located on the top floor of the building with huge and impressive sitting inside as well as some small sitting outside which gives a good view of Connaught Place. The menu is exhaustive and serves multi cuisine varying from street indian food to North indian and Oriental to Continental to Mediterranean. The prices are pretty reasonable and the portion sizes are decent. I liked the bunkers which are connected to each other and are good for hosting private parties. The look of the private cabins is very interesting , which look like big bank vaults. The sitting inside is posh and comfortable. The music too is good. The huge bar is one of the longest in town i guess.

Nidhi Jha,"Rated Age does not matter in a business if you are creative and passionate enough about something in life. Its true for the newly opened The Vault cafe young owners who are also the owners of OTB Hauz Khas, OTB Khan market, Skooter Night Club and many others in New Delhi. They are pretty much aware of the taste of Delhiites and what youth wants, so they decided to open up a concept restaurant in heart of Delhi at CP and they did it excellently. Location: The location of the Cafe is its USP. Located in CP, Inner circle in F-Block and you get the best view of Flag from the roof top. Ambience: As the name suggests the cafe quite literally has vaults in it which are interconnected through tunnels. The concept is unique and is mixed with the World War I bunker style vaults and old British style clubs. Each artefact, anitque furniture, lighting and everything is kept very rustic and undone to meet the concept. The two things that stand out in this restaurant are the 40 feet long bar and custom made wood fire oven for pizza making which is designed by well known Italian fire oven designer Marco. Marco single handedly designed and made the whole oven in 19days, and it came out to be pretty perfect. Food: If you start going through their menu, then you will be lost in it for atleast half an hour because being a multi cuisine restaurant, the menu is enormous and exhaustive Started with their signature mocktails Vault Fruit bull which was peach, watermelon, lime mixed with red bull drink and Fruit beer mixed with lime. Both were perfectly balanced with sweetness and tanginess Margherita Pizza the pizza here is unbelievably amazing and its all because of the custom made brick oven which give it . The ancient style cooking of pizza in brick oven gives it a tasty smoky flavor, toppings are still crunchy and with the brick ovens rapid cook time, pizza are made in short time and hence pizza dont get soggy when it reaches your table. Grilled Chicken breast was topped with mushroom sauce (which actually tastes like cheese but its not cheese). The chicken breast was nicely cooked on grill and is topped with mushroom sauce, and it was served with mashed potato. Surprisingly, the breast piece was not that dry like its usually is, may it was mushroom sauce aur may be it was marinated that nicely, whatever it was it was great. Mushroom Risotto made in white wine was good, but I have had better ones. This dish is perhaps not one of their best dishes. Beef Bulgogi: For me beef bulgogi, which was served with rice was revolutionary and 5/5 dish. Its a korean dish made with Marinated beef pieces and it was cooked with perfection. This dish is already listed on 23 of world's most delicious dishes. This is a must have, infact I finished the whole bowl. Their pastry comes from Hauz khas pastry shop and hence Tiramisu was delicious Service: Extremely humble and hospitable staff and everyone from their Restaurant Manager, to Assistant corporate chef, to corporate chef to their owners, everybody will try to make your experience memorable. This will give a serious competition to all the heavy weights like warehouse, RouteO4, Beer cafe and will stand out because of their eye of details for good food.

Surabhi Iyer,"Rated Well, finally we have something which isn't the usual and expected! I feel that The Vault Cafe is one of the best places to chill and dine in Delhi! The moment you enter, firstly you'll be really fascinated by the Entry door, then the interiors, everything inside vault has a vintage and raw look to it, and they've done it bang on! The private vaults that they have created are amazing! For bigger groups that's the perfect space one needs to chill with close ones! I haven't seen that here in any place till now! There are four things you just HAVE to do at Vault: - Try the peri peri chicken pizza - Try Chickpea and potato fingers - Have the Lynchberg Lemonade with Lavender and Cinnamon and fourth, of course, get a selfie with the Vaults!!

Post 15 minutes nobody showed up I had to call up the manager and told him about my experience with the food so far, he just assures me that burger will be redone by Chef...

Honestly once you enter you feel like it's a real cool place, however with delhi winters round the corner and being a saturday night we chose to sit in the open. Despite being said that we would have to wait for an hour or more we got the table in 5-7 mins. We ordered our mocktails and two snacks. And thus the long wait started , the mocktails were served quickly but the snacks seemed like were never being made. On asking the server , he jus ignored us either or overheard us. After approx an hour when we finally lost our patience he offered us to bring nachos as our drinks were already over. N friends even the nachos weren't served. The management was pathetic and highly amateur , we could notice people on other tables facing exactly the same problem and they too left the place just like we did. On asking for the cheque the waiter would ask you to go to the cash counter and pay there. They have the staff but not sn experienced one specially for days like these. So people kindly avoid this place in rush hours however of you wish to jus grab a drink and return home without paying between all this drama , Vault Cafe is the place for you:P",Rated 1.0,13,43,??

For those of you who don't know how it works, id really recommend you to check it out. This place is perfect for a casual winter date night or a weekend brunch.

Next to it rather right above it is Vault the Cafe. Outdoor sitting is what got us attracted to. + 1 Star Being in CP we expected it be packed up but the place was rather less crowded, we were given the option of sitting outside which we promptly took up on and chose the table next to the bar + 1 Star We were promptly greeted by a courteous staff member and shown the Win and food Menu. The menu looked extensive for a caf and quite a few good options. We choose and placed our order for 2 Beer and 1 Sweet and sour lime with water and two starters, the drinks were served promptly with the promise of starters in another 10 minutes + 2 Star When a place I nice and you have good company the time flies by in this case approx. 25 minutes. Our starters were not in sight and this is when we started noticing the pace of service at the vault. They had more staff then the no of customers, staff designated as security was busy taking orders, bringing orders (they clearly had no idea what they were doing). At one point a server was walking around with a order of a burger not knowing where to serve it. They eventually kept it at the bar counter. - 1 stars We got our first order and it was supposed to be deep fried wontons they were more like re fried. Decent enough but enough to cut the mark. - .5 Star Our second starter, Extra spicy chicken wings were yet to be served and we are getting it rest less. Our server was more busy taking order rather than updating us about our order, by now the outside bar had 11 staff members of all types. On the far end you could see the chefs not doing what they supposed to be doing prepping the orders how could they they were outside. 1 star Upon checking we were told that our order would take some more time their excuse- they had just opened and were running into staffing issue. I asked for the manager but someone who definitely was not the manager came by to repeat the same excuse. And if in case he was the manager then he should find another job because he clearly was out of place. -.5 Star We asked for the remainder of the order to be cancelled that took another 5 minutes.

Amrita Singh,"Rated So we decided to try out this new 'cafe' called Vault in CP. The look of the place is new and there is a terrace, and the concept is interesting but everything begins to go downhill from there. The service is poor and inefficient - the staff seems untrained as they go about with little clue about what they need to do. They just hang around in groups and take lot of time to respond. Food and drinks take a long time to appear, after you have forced someone to take your order. E.g. 2 pints of beer took 20 mins to appear and the starter came at the end of our meal, which we obviously couldn't finish. You need to remind them repeatedly of your orders. It was a Sunday but not particularly busy, and they have plenty of staff, so it's clearly a problem of training and efficient running. I will not go there again, neither will my 5 accompanying friends, nor would I recommend it to anyone. QBA just a few doors down is still a dependable option.",Rated 1.5,4,47,??
