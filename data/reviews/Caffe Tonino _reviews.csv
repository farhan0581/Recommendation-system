Toshi Gupta,"Rated Cafe Tonino! I had been eying this cafe since a long time specially because of its fancy flowery entrance decor and its unique name. The cafe has a nice old school style seating area and specializes in Italian food. Ambience as well as the service is pretty good. The staff is welcoming and comforting. The food was okay, the portions were small. Not worth the amount of money you pay. I tried their pizza and lasagne. I liked the pizza, but the lasagne was loaded with excess amount of cheese which made it difficult to eat after a few bites. Though, there mock-tails a pretty refreshing I still did not find them much different from the other cafes that I have been to. Would I visit again? No",Rated 2.5,20,329,??
Karan!!!,"Rated This quaint cafe is situated in the first floor of the PVR building & a stairway leads right to its entrance. It is an Italian cafe & is inspired by Tonino Generale, felicitated pizza maker from Italy. The rustic Italian interiors, jazzy flooring & confirmation seating combine to make a memorable gastronomic experience. But enough about the boring part. Let's come to the fooood. They are among the few merchants who offer breakfast in the area & for that they are forever etched in my list. The Frittata Siciliana, my personal favorite, is an omelette haven containing bacon, cheddar cheese, sausages, mozzarella, is served with a grilled brown bread & 2 hash browns & after gulping it down, I have no qualms about the dish in its appearance or its taste. The 2 eggs of your choice is mediocre & worth the miss. After the Frittata, I moved to the sausages & bacon which did not impress me either, one can make -do with the sausages but the bacon was undercooked & unimpressive in texture. The menu boasts a variety of dishes but nothing compares to their pizzas so, don't leave this place without trying their pizzas, a decision I regret making hastily. To accompany the dishes, the beverages are equally impressive ranging from their fresh fruit juice to the cappuccino. They change their specials everyday & are a nice addition to their repertoire. They are in the inner circle which makes it a wonderful place away from the raucous crowd of the outer circle.",Rated 4.0,80,82,??

I tried their Pasta senza glutine con salsa di pomodoro e pollo and Speziata con Pollo pizza. Both the preparations were average in taste, nothing special. But I loved their Virgin Sangria and Itallian Fantasy in their Mocktail range.",Rated 3.5,47,82,??

Based on the recommendation of the staff, we tried the tonino special mocktail which was pretty good. I ordered the Ravioli and the chicken breast, both of which were exquisite. Overall great experience. Slightly pricy but worth the money.",Rated 4.0,22,136,??
Akshi Sharma,Rated I was welcomed at Caffe Tonino with a live band playing Hotel California on the Christmas Day. Since then I totally fell in love with this place. It is one of the best places to try out for authentic Italian food. We tried pizza and pasta along with some drinks and everything that we ordered just fell way above our expectation level. The ambience is pretty much decent and the staff takes good care of their customers. On the whole is was a good first experience.,Rated 4.0,17,40,??
Rishika Kumar (missfoodiediaries),"Rated Recently I visited Caffe Tonino, Connaught Place and If i want to use the word authentic, i will use it for this very place. First of all they have this beautiful entrance and a gorgeous gallery which has some really nice and quirky photographs hanging on the wall. The moment you enter you will see loads of lights and a very spacious restaurant is waiting for you. I loved the interiors way too much and to be honest it did resemble the restaurants we see in Italy. Their photo gallery is the most expensive part of the entire restaurant and they also have a giant bar in the end. Coming on the food I had here. They served us a bread basket which had some breads and two dips which were really tasty. Then, we ordered our cocktails and mocktails. They have a wide variety of drinks in their menu. We had, A Cold Coffee, LIIT and Margharita. All these drinks were really good and they looked so pretty too SPIEDINI DI POLLO This was grilled chicken skewers with garlic, rosemary, lemon, peppers and was served with a tomato chilli jam. The chicken was tender and juicy and so were the vegetables. It was a really tasty appetizer. FRITTO MISTO DI VERDURE This dish was a mix of breaded beans, ricotta stuffed zucchini, cheesy mushrooms, mozzarella fingers served with tomato chilli jam and tartar dip. So many components in one plate but they all had distinguished flavors. My favorite was the mozzarella fingers. The two dips were really delectable and complimented everything else on the plate really well. PIZZA SANDWICH This pizza sandwich looked like a calzone but was actually an open sandwich. It had tomatoes, mozzarella, grilled zucchini, grilled bell peppers, olives, sundried tomatoes, etc., and was served with pesto and cajun fries. I personally loved this sandwich because it was different yet authentic. It was overloaded with everything and each of these elements went well together. FISH AND CHIPS I am a big fish and chips fan and the moment i indulged into this one, i was in love. It was really something so good that i wanted to eat the entire plate alone and not share it with anyone. So, the fish was really on point and melted in my mouth. The two dips were really going well with the fish and the fries were oh so amazing. All in all an ambrosial dish that i can have three four times a day. MARGHERITA So, this is what an authentic Italian pizza looks and tastes like. It had mozzarella, tomatoes and basil and was a wood fired pizza. It was just brilliant. I have no other word to describe this pizza. Simplicity at its best. If you feel that its not spicy or too cheesy so let me tell you that this is how it should be. If you're looking for original flavors then you i will surely recommend this one. TORTELLONI DI RICOTTA E SPINACI CON CREMA DI SALSA ALLO ZAFFERANO Spinach and ricotta tortelloni with creamy saffron sauce and herb oil. The second time i had tortelloni and i loved it way too much. The pasta was soft and it had spinach in such a manner that it didn't taste like spinach but rather something really tasty. The creamy sauce was yum and flavorful. My love for pasta has increased even more after eating this dish. TIRAMISU Tiramisu, an Italian dessert which if not nailed by the chef turns into a disaster. I had some really high hopes from this Tiramisu and the moment i got a spoonful in my mouth, i went to a different galaxy. It literally got over in 2-3 minutes and was so delicious and heavenly. The restaurant proved it is indeed authentic because it was very hard to make a perfect tiramisu. Full marks. CREME BRULEE & BLUEBERRY CHEESE CAKE These two desserts were really delectable and droolworthy. Caffe Tonino serves some really unbelievable desserts and you cant miss them at all. Caffe Tonino also serves some all day breakfast and from that i ordered pancakes. Pancakes are truly a healthy and tasty option for your breakfast. They had chocolate syrup, whipped cream and maple syrup. These pancakes were really delicious. My experience at Caffe Tonino was really good. From their service to their food quality and quantity, i enjoyed everything. If you are A genuine Italian food lover then this should be your next destination. Ending with a cappucino and with a smile",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
AAlok,"Rated There are some days when good company also cannot save the day for an average restaurant. I have been to the original Tonino several times and have never been disappointed. CP version is a completely different story. Service was slow, portions are so tiny that they cant even suffice 2, prices are crazy.

Khushinder Singh Kohli,"Rated We wanted to try out a new place for Italian on Sunday and eventually zeroed in on Caffe Tonino. We ordered the following items: Chicken Caesar salad Chicken pizza Chicken lasagne Grilled chicken (from special of the day menu) Chocolate lasagne Panna Cotta Creme brle It started all well. The salad, pizza and the grilled chicken were all very nice. But then the desserts sort of ruined it a bit. I love having desserts, and since it's the last thing to go in before we leave, it greatly affects the overall experience I have at a particular restaurant. We ordered 2 desserts initially - panna cotta and chocoate lasagne (they were out of tiramisu). While the chocoate lasagne was ok, the panna cotta had too much gelatin. When we pointed it out to our waiter, he offered to replace it with the Creme brle at no extra charge. Unfortunately, the creme brle was only just better than the panna cotta. So probably have the food here, and then desserts somewhere else.",Rated 3.0,104,513,??
Megha Garg,"Rated Caff Tonino is a beautiful place, a very beautiful restaurant. Small, but still spacious enough. Service is quick, music is soothing. The theme, ""italian"" definitely is kept well.

Manish S  Gulati,"Rated Caff tonino is a quaint & a cozy restaurant primarily serving the Italian cuisine located in the heart of delhi away from the hustle & bustle next to pvr. Plaza. The cafe is on the first floor as I went up the stairs I waswelcomed with the smiling faces . Oh my god the place itself is so enticing, beautiful done decor with white brick walls interesting framed pictures/posters & nicely set up place with a nice workstation. Everything was just perfect .As I settled down I ordered for baked stuffed potatoes, a vegetable pizza & a mocktail .The stuffed potatoes were just baked to perfection loaded with cheese accompanied with veg. Salad & the Aroma just elevated my senses & the presentation was superb .Now coming to the pizza it was thin crust wood fired pizza & it was properly baked with lots of veggies like tomatoes ,bell peppers,Borocoll & mushroom & the mozerella cheese was Oozing out . A pure delight. The mocktail I ordered was Caff tonino delight mocktail which was flavoured with kiwi & pineapple which was totally refreshing & nice. After finishing the above,my taste buds were craving for something sweet so ordered choclate lasagna from a desert section which was actually a brownie with a scoop of vanilla. What to say the desert was completely out of world as I took a bite it completely melt in my mouth & had a burst of flavours. The staff was very amicable, courteous and helpful & service too was of top notch. I just loved every bit of it. Kudos to the whole team of Caff tonino. Highly recommend the place where you can just relaxin a laid back atmosphere with amazing ambience and food.",Rated 5.0,18,43,??

Soumyadip Saha,"Rated A well lit Caff located in Connaught place;a place to have long conversations with good food. The Caff is beautifully decorated with good ambience, polite staff, (although the washroom is out of order at the moment! :P) offering ' wood fried oven pizzas', although I didn't order pizzas today instead went for the tuna and tomato sandwich (panino con tonno e pomodori) with cappuccino. But had to wait for about twenty minutes for the food to arrive on the table. No complaints regarding the quality though. The sandwich was perfect along with the cappuccino. Cost me about six hundred rupees so not too expensive. Happy with the experience.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The Intrepid Eater,"Rated The high ratings at Caffe Tonino baffle me. The interiors are nice, but everything else felt like a disaster yesterday. Me and my boyfriend had vouchers for a 3-course meal (nearbuy) and after asking multiple times, were first given the wrong menu, despite our pointing out that there ought to be a different menu. The staff was so busy checking the validity of the vouchers, that they didn't have time to offer us a menu or drink! After we had already ordered A la carte, the waiters stood a few feet away, within earshot, discussing what to do since it was, like we had said, the wrong menu. We were told that we had ordered dishes that were not included, but that since the appetisers had already been ordered, that would be served. We ordered further from the new menu. The appetisers were surprisingly small (one stick of Shrimp!)- I suspect they reduced serving sizes to compensate for the ""wrong order"". My ""Homemade Fettucine with Parmesan"" had the tiniest of cheese gratings on top (and none in the sauce) and my boyfriend's Risotto with Saffron was actually rice in cream and turmeric, with a few chunks of unidentifiable processed cheese on top. Opon pointing out that this is not what one expects of a Risotto, the waiter conferred with the ""chef"" (once again within earshot) and told us that this was the authentic way of cooking it. The insult to our tastes aside, this is not like any risotto I've had anywhere in Italy, or even comparable to that of places like Uzzurri or Olive. We then said we would like to return the dish as it was inedible. Any respectable restaurantwould have had us talking to the chef or manager at this point, but our waiter asked if we would like to get it packed! Our desserts were unsurprisingly also letdowns, with a flavourless pannacotta that came out badly from it's casing (pictures coming up shortly) and smiley faces (!) on the plates trying to make up for watery Tiramisu. I guess being asked to move tables because there was a big group coming (none came in the 90 minutes we were there) or the lack of service despite there being multiple wait staff and hardly any customers should have given us a clue. Over a couple thousand rupees down the drain I am left to wonder, how did Tonino get such good ratings?",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Devashish Marwah,"Rated Great place for a nice lunch - be it a quick lunch during work or an elaborate one with friends and family. The sangria served at this outlet was really nicely made which went well with the food served. The chicken lasagne as well the the pizza were a good selection. The ambience is nice and warm, do give it a shot. Price: a little towards he higher side.",Rated 4.0,76,236,??

Shantanu Chandna,Rated It is a fine dining cafe kind of place. Ambience - white interior which gives it a unique ambience. Soothing place Service - no complaints Food- only Italian cuisine is their plus there own variety of burgers . i ordered one mix sauce pasta which was perfect italian style pasta and i enjoyed each and every bite of it and in dessert i ate there chocolate lasagne which was not different as the name suggests it was a normal chocolate brownie topped with chocolate sauce and served with vanilla ice cream.

Yamini Bhargava,"Rated To start with the interiors of the space are nicely done. The walls are given textured brick finish, the place is lit fine but not too much. The seating is average and fine for someone with short height but a tall person might have issues with the width of the seats of the sofa. Coming to the food, we ordered buffalo wings which were amazing and delicious, it came with two dips one was peri peri which was fine and the other dip somehow tasted like south Indian chutney and frankly speaking was bad. The fries were crisp but lacked a little salt. Then we ordered stuffed potatoes with chicken and cheese, it came with a portion of salad which was fine but lettuce was dry and probably a little old. The potatoes were tasty but were a little rubbery on the bottom. For main course we had pizza , it was a little burnt, and it had nothing amazing about it. It was fine and not bad types. Nothing Wow about it. So as a whole the place was average and can be visited once. Lastly as mentioned in other reviews the deal is selective and is not valid for the whole menu.",Rated 2.0,20,76,??
Neha Gupta,"Rated I happened to try out this place on one of my regular visits to CP. Located behind PVR plaza , this cafe has rich interiors and looks like a posh upmarket outlet. The items on the menu appear to be a little overpriced but its totally convincing when they actually serve you the food since the quality and quantity both justify the pricing. We had ordered Minestrone Veg Soup which was a veg tomato soup with little touch of basil and tasted really good. What a treat to have a yum soup in winters!! We also ordered Veg Pizza Sandwich. The presentation was good and the size of the sandwich was also a little bigger than the usual. It was full of vegetables done in little cheese and tasted perfect. I would definitely pay a visit again.",Rated 4.0,32,101,??
Vikram Jain,"Rated I had read many good reviews, but doubted how a place can serve such delicious pizza. Well, it does. The crust is done to perfection. The cheese is rich and tasty. there is an adequate amount, but not too much. Sauce is awesome.

Asmita Singh,"Rated This place is definitely attractive looking! As you enter up the rather rugged staircase , you'll step onto a beautiful geometric flooring pattern in a space filled with artworks on its white walls. Coming to what you'll be going here for , the food. It's going to take time, so you need to be prepared for that. The portions are decent , the preparation is good and presentation compliments. If you're planning on going with a big group sharing dishes, this might not be the best place. We ordered the Pollo Croccante, chicken which was really well done , the spice was right and the compliments went really well. The burgers are rather dry. But , the pizzas ( Salame Piccante:Non-Veg and Pizza Sana:Veg ) were right on the crispiness of the crust and the cheesiness for a wood fired pizza. The pizza sandwich is an interesting dish on their menu! If the Chicken Lasagne is inviting you too, please don't make the mistake. It's unfortunately a small piece of pastry with layers of white chocolate and dark chocolate cake. None the less, definitely a to go again for the breakfast menu, it looked great !",Rated 3.5,39,159,??

Place is in the heart of the capital, nearby nizam's opp pvr plaza complex, you won't have difficulty in finding the place ( I had, cuz it's on first floor and difficult to spot) Interiors and ambience is awesome. Food : they serve according to their name, yes it's an Italian restaurant but, the Italian touch is missing. I ordered an aglio e olio, to which the waiters response was umm what's that..?? Later I settled for spaghetti. My friend ordered a ravioli, it was good but big lumps of pumpkins should not have been in there. Pizza, I tried on my second visit, it was not that awesome, just average. Drinks are at decent price. Cost : just above average. No doubt, the place is overrated.

Situated on first floor the place looks decent, service is good, we went on a Monday so place was quite empty. We order their square pizza, a chicken ravioli, an Italian something Italian smooch mocktail and some watermelon cocktail. Drinks ok not that we were expecting it to be great.

Sonya D,"Rated Walked into the restaurant without knowing anything about it, and found ourselves in a little Italian cafe, small, neat, intimate. Enjoyed the atmosphere and the food! Music perhaps just a shade louder than necessary but that was easily forgotten as the food arrived, faster than one expects. The chicken vegetable soup was tasty though not particularly remarkable. Breads accompanying the soup were wonderfully fresh and eaten with that tomato and olive combination, just delicious. The Caprese salad was fresh, well balanced, and pretty. Grilled chicken on skewer was somewhat tough to eat, not melt in the mouth. Its portion size was small too. Salmon pasta was yummy though as it cooled, the pasta became a tad chewy. Sadly the chocolate lasagna, of which one has high hopes, turned out to be a delicious warm brownie instead of layers of pasta and chocolate sauce :(",Rated 4.5,1,1,??

On my first visit, I had dinner and their staff was very nice to us. My friend and I left our debit cards with them by mistake and the waiter chased us all the way to our car to return it. This was very sweet of him. For our breakfast today we ordered their banana caramel pancake, waffles, bacon, sausages and coffee along with some other items. Everything was cooked to perfection. The bacon was so delicious I need some time to get over its smokey flavour. Was craving some good breakfast and this place was good enough :)",Rated 4.0,13,5,??

Rahul Jain,"Rated Summary- Veg Review- Zomato menu outdated, Excellent Staff, disappointing food, expensive affair, modest ambiance. I will be honest right off the bat. This was our first visit to the restaurant and the waiters did ask us if there was any problem, but we were catching up after a long time and really didn't want to cause any problems, but I am pretty sure that they would have responded in a professional manner. They have an excellent waiting staff and their service is the only reason that the rating is 2 instead on 1. The ambiance is not above average and we would have probably been less critical of it if the place was not so ridiculously expensive. If you want to be expensive, you have to provide either exceptional quality, a unique experience or/and good quantity (which would actually reduce the expense factor, but anyways). They didn't provide any of the following. The food was mediocre at best. You have an oven on display, great! Make sure that it provides some good food as well. Bruschetta was an outright disaster. Kindly consider having some standard options instead of Bruschetta of the day if you cannot carry it off with aplomb. The other starters were the saving grace by being average (we ordered stuffed veg potatoes and fritto Misto). The square pizza was dry and lacking sauce and cheese and bear in mind that I am not, NOT comparing them with the processed fast food versions. But Italian does not mean bland. Not saying that you need to put more toppings, but at least make the pizza something that can be savored. Pasta was okay at best, and Pizza Sana felt better only in comparison. I do not know how I would have responded to it on any other day, maybe average would have been the verdict. All being said and done, I will consider giving them the benefit of doubt as this was my first visit and pretty sure that it will be my only visit, but a big thumbs up to their staff.",Rated 2.0,26,64,??
Deepika Kapoor,"Rated The moment you enter you'll notice the uniqueness of the ambience. It is classy and exotic! The menu is difficult to read with not so common dishes. One thing worth mentioning is the Chocolate Lasagne which is not as fancy as it sounds. Small chocolate brownie with one scoop of vanilla is what i got in the same of chocolate lasagne!

The bougainvillea covered window panes, the soft pastel decor and the Christmas cheer perfectly accompanied the smoky pizza flavours from the oven! The J.Ballerina had the perfect touch of rosemary in the gin, served with lovely bread and a black olive spread; the baked potatoes melted in the mouth just like they should; and the pepperoni pizza was surprisingly light but quite filling.

The lighting theme is golden yellow inside(not dim). We ordered beers and Gnocchi pasta. The pasta tasted better than many other italian cafes. Generally, we get two breads accompanied by pastas in max cafes or restro bars, but here they offered unlimited breads with varying tastes that would suit any one from junkie to health freaks like multi grain bread was there too. There menu had lot of wines to offer which eventually led to have one. Only Indian red wine was available per serving compared to full bottle otherwise. We zeroed in on the same but the attendant gave option of one CAFARE imported italian red wine, which tasted good indeed with servings of 3, on the economical side as the attendant suggested. To sum up, a chocolate lasagna we found on the menu, and was yum. Ambience- 4/5 Service- 5/5(very polite, courteous and mannered staff.

For the first time in my life I didn't have to add any seasoning or sauces to my pasta as it was so nice to taste. The servings were generous and this entire meal was good for two people.

Half Thalli Full,"Rated Situated right next to PVR plaza and nizams's, its quite easy to miss this cafe, specially given that its sign board is covered in beautiful foliage. The cafe is located on the first floor and has a really nice, earthy, classy decor. The painted brick walls, the wood fired oven, the comfortable seating etc. all combine to make this a great place to spend time at. The service was nice and fast. We ordered the following: 1) Peri Peri chicken: ordered this as it was listed on their specials board. The chicken wasn't rubbed with peri peri spice but came with a peri peri sauce which tasted okay and wasn't anything special. The salad and Cajun fries served with the dish were great. 2) Non veg pizza sandwich: this was more like a quesadilla than a sandwich. The freshness and the flavour of the tomatoes, mozzarella, ham and rocket leaves shone through. However even before we could finish one of the three pieces, the dish got soggy and spoilt the taste. Maybe they should change their service plate. 3) Pollo alla parmigiana: I'm a sucker for chicken Parmesan and their dish was great. The chicken was well crumbed and cooked, both the tomato and cheese sauce tasted great. Great dish this. Overall I would recommend Caffe Tonino to people looking for a place for an unhurried meal.

The white walls with the old style architecture and interioirs does take you back in time. I am an absolute sucker for good ambiance and having entered this cafe was quite a delight. But, as if to ruin things for me, the loud band playing rock music put me off completely. I gave the place a second try, and went back in the day once again. And that's when I found out how amazingly beautiful this little restaurant is! There is often a lack of choices for vegetarians, but this place, being Italian was quite the opposite. The menu has equal options for both. I ordered the Bruschetta, Antipasti Veg and a pizza recommended by the chef, all of which were quite okay. The Bruschetta was a tad bit disappointin and dry, but I relished it nevertheless.The antipasti platter had every element of the dish cooked to perfection. The portions were more than i'd expected and i was quite happy with the quantity vs pricing. The pizza was like any other place, it was wood fired, but not something I'll order once more.

Amrita,"Rated Cafe tonino.. I stumbled upon this place while wandering around in CP.. Hidden in a corner, this obscure little eatery has a modest outward appearence but as I entered this place, I marveled at my discovery. Exquisite interior setting gives this place a feel of a desolate small mountain cafe overlooking meadows and maybe a wineyard (getting carried away i know... lol) though it has zero view.. Given that it was early evening, the crowd was sparse and the mood almost romantic. Feeling almost special, like fate had chosen me to come here, I became particularly hungry. The menu contained names I could never have interpreted without help... fancy long sentences in italian or maybe french, I wouldnt know... Feeling especially adventurous I ordered vegetarian antipasti plate ( having no idea what it meant, I googled it after) and ravioli de pere e parmigiana con salvia burro and mondorle ( see what I mean?).. So we got this colourful and beautifully presented plate of fresh looking veggie things with speck of delicious cheese and drizzles of fantastic liquidy dressing... more of a visual delight, we nevertheless happily dismantled the construct and devoured it.... the next was a ravioli dish with pear filling and heavy almond and butter sauce... nothing like anything I've tasted before... mild, flavorful, buttery and the almond gave it a very nice texture... very heavy dish, meant for the kings... The desserts looked appealing and the functional clay oven nearby was begging us to order a classic italian pizza.. (next time for sure) So all in all, I had a lovely evening with great friends feeling like I was nowhere near Delhi.. Will reserve my next visit- along with my boyfriend for a cozy date maybe.. and try out more of their classic italian goodies....",Rated 4.0,19,24,??

SincerelyKangna,"Rated Located next to PVR Plaza, this place can be ideally termed as a hidden gem. Being a fan of small cafes, I loved my short visit to this eatery. Menu is nicely designed, each dish is well described. Most of the menu has Italian food on offer. A seperate section is dedicated for Breakfast menu which mainly has combination of some English and French dishes.Their bar menu somehow was very crisp and had limited things on offer. I wish they had exclusive section for wines. Italian food goes too well with wine, atleast i am fan. Most of the food was presented well. I ordered baked stuffed potatoes and pizza sana, both dishes had authentic flavours and feel. Baked stuffed potato had filling of thyme, corn, zucchini and tri-pepper which was served with a side salad. I totally loved the dish, as it was served piping hot. Pizza too was cooked to perfection, had good amount of cheese and toppings added to it, just the way i like it. For some reason, I was in no mood to try any dessert. Nevertheless, i enjoyed what I ordered.Ambience is nice with mostly all wooden tables and cremishly done walls. Place is well lit and background music will not disturb your conversations. This place does not much have a cafe feel to it but is aquaintplace which shall do justice to its vicinity. Another pluspoint, this place can happilyaccommodatelarge groups, incase you wish to visit it with your gang of friends.Service was quick, mainly because I visited this cafe in day time and more than half of the place was empty.

Anneka Majhi,"Rated UPDATE: Cafe Totino, promptly responded to my previous review and kindly sent me another pizza on the house. This time, they amp up their game, delighting me in pleasing my olfactory department. If you are a person who like their pizza both sweet, savory and tangy, make sure you order Pizza Senza Pomodoro aka the one with broccoli, mushrooms, feta cheese, mozzarella and caramelized onions. It's a pizza you wont mind enjoying, because it is healthy and tasty at the same time. So, thank you for the prompt home delivery. For the courteousness and prompt service shown, I definitely recommend this place and I will make sure I will visit it in future. Previous Review:I was looking forward to curbing by craving for thin crust pizza by getting it home delivered from Cafe Totino. I was genuinely excited because all the food and reviews had my expectations so high. I ordered Pizza Senza Pomodoro aka the one with broccoli, feta cheese and caramelized onions. It was a disappointment. So dissapointed that I did even take a picture of the pizza. They did put any tomato sauce, they did not even put feta cheese like they said in the description! I don't understand why would they do this kind of injustice to home delivery orders! So basically i was eating a great nice crust without the ingredients that were specified in the menu. And it was tasteless. I am never ordering again. Moreover I am never going to go to the restaurant because of the negligence shown in home deliveries.",Rated 4.0,2,8,??
Jai Andrew Lawrence,Rated Came here for dinner with a relatively large group and they accommodated us well. We started off with the bruschetta which was light and had a nice hint of vinegar. I ordered the pizza Sana which was a whole wheat pizza with low fat ricotta. There was probably more mozzarella in it than ricotta and definitely not as healthy as they made it seem but was good nonetheless. For my mains I had the buffalo burger. Slightly disappointed with patty size and was dry on the outside but well cooked on the inside.

Pulkit Gupta,"Rated Again, I am writing this review in retrospect. I went to this place after reading its good reviews on zomato sometime back. Being a lover of Italian cuisine, I was very keen to try this place in connaught place as it is not very far off for me! The decor is very tastefully done. Large glass windows with climbers all over outside giving an European look. For mocktail, I ordered 'virgin sangria' which was very nice with fresh fruits in it. By mistake, the staff had initially given 'virgin mojito' mocktail. Then immediately, they came up with the actual drink ordered and duly apologised. When I told them that they could take the virgin mojito back as I had not ordered that, they said that since it was a goof up from their end.. It was complimentary. Something, I have usually not encountered at many places as usually the staff takes it back. The thin crust pizza ordered was half of 'pizza greca' and half of 'speziata con pollo'. It was delicious and very nicely made. We then ordered 'Gnocchi con pomodori arrosto e cavolo romano'. Honestly, I didn't like it much but I cannot blame them for it. It was a wrong choice from my end as it was just potato which I felt I didn't enjoy much. Finally, for the dessert I wanted to try Waffles with maple syrup which they offer only in breakfast menu. But, again they happily obliged and made it specially. It was simply delectable served with wiped cream and maple syrup. Overall, to sum up if you love Italian cuisine and you are around connaught place it is definitely worth going! USP - Thin crust pizzas.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Anisha Agrawal,"Rated In one word, disappointing. I had this place bookmarked and was quite excited. I was supposed to meet some friends there for lunch and was really hungry as I was running late. The cafe is done up minimally, with the barest hints of an Italian atmosphere. It looks like a good place to relax and talk for long hours. However, the service is inattentive (or maybe they are a little understaffed). We had to ask for water refills and change of plates. The food is nothing you haven't had before. We ordered the gnocchi and the spaghetti with meatballs. Pretty standard fare but the portions were a tad small for the price. The spicy chicken pizza was tasty (appropriately thin crust, piping hot, reallllly spicy) but maybe a bit too dry. We also ordered a lasagna and this was okay too. I felt everything was a little too salty. The breads provided with the pasta were a bit of a joke (two tiny slivers) and there was no bread basket. Then came desserts. The panna cotta was a huge disappointment. For the price specified, it was a tiny portion, and the pink and green garnishing pretty much ruined the taste of the caramel sauce, which tasted a little strange anyway. One thing, however, which I enjoyed was the Affogato, which was a novel dessert for me. It is really very simple and kind of comforting: a dollop of vanlla ice-cream on an esspresso shot, topped with your favourite biscotti. I'm sure I'll try it at home. The point is, the food is not that bad, though I wouldn't call it good Italian either. It's just that there were small disappointments throughout the meal that kind of spoilt my experience for the place. I am not going back there again because I know of other places that serve better food and serve food better.",Rated 3.0,6,102,??

Tonino's is situated in the lane next to PVR Plaza. A short staircase through a pretty entrance takes you in this small cafe, versy tastefully done with typical arches , bright coloured walls and the harsh cacophony of the this honk happy nation is left behind. We were there for a breaksfast . Fritatta Siciliana which I had ordered was well made , so was Egg's Benedict .Coffee was brilliant. So, it all made for a good beaksfast , and they even served pasta to us on our request coz if an Italian restaurant promises to serve you freshly made pasta then you must have it.

The very moment you approach the entrance, you're greeted with soft euphonic music, sophisticated decor and well kempt interiors. To sum up on the ambience, the place is quite refined. Now coming to the service, the turn around time needs some betterment. Basic things like refilling glasses with water, summoning waiters, asking for cheques is slow and can be frustrating eventually. We just ordered the triple crme brul. Which were 3 tea cups filled with flavoured crme and a certain frosted crust on top of each served on a tray. Nothing more.

The ambience was nicely lit and had a semi gothic castle feel to it. Flags drapped here and there gave it an old Italian cafe feel. And that is exactly what it was like. We started by ordering a Tomato soup and Tuscan Deep Fried veggies (off their Tuscan Food Festival menu) along with Pollo Crocantte from their regular menu. Though the dishes were exotic, they turned out to be too balnd for our taste. Perhaps as Indians we arent used to something that isnt even least spicy or maybe it was just a case of nisplaced expectations.

The sauce along with the pasta were perfectly cooked. However the pizza and fettuccine pasta were not good. The amount of feta cheese and tomato sauce in the pizza were inversely proportional.

Akhil Verma,"Rated The idea was a date night and amongst the plethora of options, this city has to offer, it becomes a major task to pick the right place. After a tedious discussion of what we wanted, I had given up on the idea of going out and suggested let's just go home but my girlfriend insisted that she had seen this beautiful small cafe in Connaught Place that will be perfect. It is indeed hidden, behind PVR plaza, and can only be discovered by those who are looking for it. Since it was a Monday night, the place was mostly empty (which is how I like it), and we were seated on a small table towards the window. The place is beautifully lit up, not too bright and not too dark, the seating arrangement is well thought out and the small decorations really add to the theme of this cafe.We started with two Manhattans, a bourbon whiskey cocktail that surprised us both with its taste, some offer got us starters for free which basically consisted of nachos and peanuts. The service was upto the mark, and the hosts were quite attentive. We followed this with teachers highland cream (an absolute favorite).For the record, the happy hours mentioned on zomato are not active, as of now which was a bit of a turn off. We settled for the pizza greca, as wood fired pizza looked like their speciality and it was flawless, thin crust and a lot of feta cheese made our day. The whole thing cost us 2000 bucks which is fair enough for a place like this.That was it for the night, we hope to visit again and experience more of their food.",Rated 4.5,76,307,??

In comparison to their MG road restaurant, this one falls short in taste and the wholesome experience of ""Tonino"" that we are used to, courtesy their MG road outlet.. The shakes are good, but nothing to rave about.. Pasta is a must have, whereas the bruschetta needs to be definitely avoided..

This niche cafe provides you the perfect ambiance to enjoy a small little meal and have a great conversation simultaneously. If you're looking for a great value for money, this is not the place to be. A tad bit more on the expenses, but they charge for what they provide. Sitting pretty next to PVR Plaza, one can nearly miss it, if they don't have a keen eye. A flight of stairs with intricate wall patterns and a chandelier overhead ( Yes, I love it when people put effort to make a place look pretty), leads to an extended vertical passage. It immediately transports you to a different realm. I was very surprised by how huge it was. It sprawled across two huge rooms. We settled in a comfortable spot besides a window. We went in for a quick meal, so did not order much. Ordered a Pizza Senza Pomodoro and a Cappuccino. The pizza was delicious and had me craving for more. The coffee could have been better.

Siddharth Michael Sudhakar,"Rated I love finding hidden places in Delhi, and that too in CP. I love CP I love the culture there, I love the food there, I love finding food there. Caf Tonino is a great find. Located in the middle circle and has a cute look from outside. Having a meal there is actually an experience. Very authentic and to the point Italian food. If you are looking for something new, a business meeting place or a date night after marriage - This place will do wonders for you. Ambiance If I was an Italian don, I would hold all my meetings here! It is spacious, its sophisticated and it drools class. Outside sitting is not an option which they should start, a good use of breads for decoration. I like the combination of posters, plants and the vibrant colors on the wall. Soft music and the whole theme is to the point. They know what they are doing with the place. In the ambiance sector is scores well. Food Well the food has a class of its own. It does not have a complicated menu as Amalfi but not as easy as big chill also. It is in the middle. For appetizers we ordered Pollo Croccante which was chicken in egg batter deep fried - Served with mustard mayo. I found this to be an average dish. It really did not work with me. Although on the menu it looked very tempting. The mustard mayo also was a horrible idea. The wood fire pizzas of this place are in a class of their own. Best thin crust pizza I ever had. We ordered two. One was the Senza Pomodoro which was basically three cheeses and caramelized onion which was amazing. Like the taste and texture seemed to good to be true. The other which we ordered was the salame piccante A classic pepperoni pizza to satisfy your tummy. Again a good pizza with no regrets. For drinks we ordered wine which I believe they should add more variety to. Also a cocktail Cupido 333 which was so yummy , I could have three. Service The service was good and the servers knew how to help the customer. They knew the menu well. In short a good deal. So in the end I suggest this must be on youre to go list.

EMPTY STOMACH,Rated This little italian cafe is situated right next to pvr plaza in cp. This place was suggested to me by a friend of mine. Just like any other italian cafe this place gives you all the positive vibes unlike its menu and food ofcourse. I was suggested to try out its vegetarian burgers which were difficult to find in its such a complicated menu. Finally i asked the server about it who was not so sure about its own menu. Another server came and helped us out but since there was only one option for a veggie and that too didn't sound much appealing so we went for arrabieta pasta and cheese garlic bread ( since our initial choice of bruchetta was not available). Within a short span of time our drinks and food arrived. Italian passion and iced cafe latte were good but lime soda was pathetic. It was sour and tasteless. Pasta was average (something i wont suggest) and garlic bread was too chewy. It was not baked well. Now the funny part is the same friend who suggested me this place accompanied me and it became very much clear that this place can not maintain its consistency. Ambience 3/5 Service 2/5 Food 2/5 (rating it this low because of its inconsistent taste) Value for money 2/5 Also this place donot serve breads which every authentic italian restaurant does.

Jain.tarang3894,"Rated Lunch at cafe tonino situated in cannaught place, delhi. It is an italian cafe offering wide n different kind of pastas that are not available everywhere. Ordered ENOKI PASTA in red sauce. Enoki is basically made of potatoes unlike other flour consisting pastas. It was really good and ambience is also good. Overall nice experience.",Rated 4.0,5,4,??
Rishabh Khanna,"Rated Caffe tonino !! As the name tonino has a tiny portion size as compared to its prices. Pasta was just normal nthn spcl about it. Pizza was chin crust crispy and good flavour but again toppings were tiny. We also ordered a chicken burger which was good. The patty was good and the burger was juicy, comes with fries as usual. Deserts, we ordered panna cotta with caramel sauce which is somewhere around 250 and the size of it is just a size of a tennis ball. Ambiance is super, can make u think as if u are in a cafe in italy. Taste is ok but ain't value for money.",Rated 3.0,38,83,??

Abhinav Rastogi,"Rated I was there yesterday night - business seemed slow for a Saturday night I would think. Anyhow, the usher seated the 3 of us on a table pronto. The entry to the restaurant is nothing to write home about. Parking will be an issue on busy days. But frankly, that is the case for all Connaught Place outlets. One of the good things about the original Tonino (Chattarpur) is that there are no parking hassles. By now, you'd have realized we were driven to this place because we love the original Tonino restaurant. Moving ahead, we wanted to celebrate an occasion. We asked for the wine menu. The server did not have any clue about the wines or how he should serve them. Firstly, they have a really poor collection of reds by the glass (or whites for that matter). Secondly, the guy took an order from the limited list and came back to us in 10 minutes to tell us the selected wine wasn't available (btw the wine was something he recommended us to have). Thirdly, they don't know how to serve wine. The server showed us the bottle and said are you okay with it? I said typically this decision is taken after you let us taste/sample the wine (at this point, I was just playing because I had realized that he didn't know jack about this). He told us that unfortunately the only thing we could do is see the label and decide. No consideration if the restaurant had screwed up the storage or the transport of the wine (which we can't ascertain by the label). Now to food, 25 mins in - we were still waiting for the food menu despite asking twice. They wouldn't give us one promptly even after asking. I am not even asking for the server to keep an eye on the table and promptly appear when required. I was calling out the server. We ordered mushroom crostini (because they didn't have tomato bruschetta despite having it on the menu) and a vegetarian caesar salad. The crostini was good (portions are tiny) and the salad was cheesy/creamy making it taste really good (of course, they know Indian palates). For mains, we ordered a mixed sauce pasta and pizza sandwiches. The pasta was above average and pizza sandwiches were horrible. For dessert, we ordered a caramel waffle. This was the best part of the evening. It was yum! Maybe this is a good place for breakfast. I will never know because the service will keep me away. Lastly, the ambiance was good with some nice house music. Food - 2/5 Service - 1/5 Ambiance - 3.5/5 Value for money - 3/5",Rated 2.5,8,76,??

Chicken strips marinated to perfection with a fried wrap on top. It was mouthwatering. Then came the bolognese meatball pasta, which was pretty good. And lastly we had ordered for the sausages pizza which was a low for us in the 3 dishes we ordered. Pizza was pretty bland and the toppings weren't adding anything to the pizza. Was disappointed with an Italian place not having an epic pizza. Maybe next time I go to Caff tonino I'll skip ordering a pizza.",Rated 3.5,27,224,??

This restaurant tried to emulate an Italian style interiors and a decent menu to support it. We ordered two starters, a vegetarian bruschetta and a chicken starter called Pollo Croccante. I'm not a fan of bruschetta, but this felt pretty nice to taste. The Pollo Croccante was pretty much on lines of a spring roll with sausage-ish chicken steps inside. It felt like authentic Italian, may be because of the little spices in the dish. I've always been a fan of Italian think crust pizza and this place is one of the most authentic places I've been to that serves great pizza. We ordered a Pizza Sana. It's not the best pizza, but feels like it's straight from an Italian household. If you're interested in trying out nice pizza, this is worth a try. We ordered a Penne All Arrabiata with a mix of white sauce and angry tomato herb sauce. Well, it was an okayish pasta. It's sort of a cuisinal sin to not have a dessert at an Italian restaurant. So, we ordered the dessert that was readily available then, Chocolate Lasagna. It was nice, new and different. Overall, this place is worth a try if you're looking for a simple and serene dinner spot.",Rated 3.5,24,445,??

Aman Goel,Rated A place with an ambience which looks like a suburb of Italy with nothing done up too loudly but with a good taste. Going to the food i would say that although I have not ordered a lot the Provenzale pizza tasted yummy but yet as it was whole wheat it was extremely healthy. And the drink called Italian fantasy was looking quiet appealing by it's name however I hated the taste and it was no good then a Tropicana mixed fruit juice.! The service was also not upto the mark as all of the servicemen were busy with their own meeting rather than attending to the guests. -1* for late service -1* for pathetic overpriced drink,Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The crust was thin and soft, loaded with cheese and mushrooms. Though my friends who ordered chicken lasagne and a non veg platter weren't really happy with the portions and the taste.

Let me first talk about the pros first : 1) Hospitable staff. 2) Nice ambience. That's it, period. Now for the cons : 1) Pizza Greca : The crust was overly thin with burnt corners ( pictures say it all). Being completely tasteless was another flaw. 2) Baked Stuffed potatoes : Just OK. 3) Minty Mango : Way too minty and very less mango. 4) Orange bloom : Still better but after like 4 sips, ice is all you taste.

It's more suited for romantic and intimate gateways. A perfect plan for dates I would say. Anyway, moving on to food and drinks. In drinks we ordered cafe tonino's delights, minty mango and Italian fantasy. They all were pretty average. Nothing special.

Prateek Kumar,Rated Great ambiance. The decorations and white bare wall and the wide windows give it a very sober feel. The red sauce pasta and the starters were good. The greko pizza was not to our liking and we probably misplaced our order as it was not written or notified that they will put raw spinach leaves on the pizza. The pasta also had spinach but instead of being made the lasagna way they used spinach purie with white sauce to make the pasta and it didn't go very well with our taste buds.

The wood fire oven outside( near the dining area) gives it a more rusty look. Although the food is great and satisfying, but I would love to see a larger portion of food on my plate for the price. The service was sloopy; even though we went at an odd time, for breakfast. The waiters did not respond promptly and the service was too slow. The food was worth the wait.",Rated 3.5,2,9,??

Now the presentation of the food is good and i am not saying the food is bad but they gotta up their quality of ingredients. I tried their after nine dessert coffee and it tasted watered down. Couldn't get the coffee or the mint taste to stand out. Hot cafe mocha was pretty nice. Then came the chocolate lasagna which is presented well but damn how do you go mess up chocolate. Cafe tonino, you have a lot going for you, you're better than the average CP restaurant. Upgrade your ingredients. Don't settle, JUST DO IT( Shia Lebouf style)",Rated 3.5,13,13,??

It was a quiet place where we sat , ate and chatted for hours. The staff was really nice and courteous. Coming to the food, it was nice but could be better. We wanted to order bruschetta but it was not available. We were suggested to order garlic bread with salsa instead which was quite nice. We also ordered baked stuffed potatoes which were good in presentation as well taste. Pizza senza pomodoro was just ok. One thing I would say is the serving was small as compared to the price, so I found it expensive for the amount of food that we were served. We also ordered two mocktails, minty mango and orange bloom which I liked.a lot. Overall a nice place, would like to visit again. Only con serving size is small !!!!",Rated 3.5,3,0,??

Ritu Gupta,"Rated You enter this place and immediately like the tastefully done interiors and the setting in general. Their menu is italian converted to english to indicate they serve authenticity. Coming to the food, ( oh, i should mention i am a vegetarian so will be able to comment only on the vegetarian dishes, but i guess animals taste good everywhere, eh? ) i ordered a ceasar salad which i would rate 3/5 as it didnt have enough parmesan according to my taste and the ceasar salad dressing was flowy as opposed to the thick dressing that i love. Then came the pizza, wood fired thin pizza that i loved The toppings were abundant in quantity and taste was authentic. My issue was the price, i am all for high end restaurants and the feel that comes along with it. While this place had the feel quotient, the food wasnt worth the price. To sum it up, it was more of a went there for the first time and wont probably go again for a long time. P.s i have been to the tonino on mg road and i loved it back then. But that was a long time ago and i am more a ""was it worth it"" person now. Need to revisit for a newer memory and ofcourse a review.",Rated 3.5,10,20,??
Moonmoon Ghosh,"Rated Super spacious and a lovely ambience, which gives the place a glowing warm feel. The servers were both prompt and polite. We ordered the pollo alla parmigiana and the pasta al pesto, both of which were absolutely delicious. The parmigiana, particularly, was both tasty and tastefully presented. For dessert, the chocolate lasagna is a must-try -- took all of five minutes to gobble up the beauty. A couple of cons: The portions are relatively smaller than what other places/cafes, along the same price tag, offer. Also, the restaurant only serves chicken; there is no red meat (mutton, lamb, etc.) anywhere on the menu, be it the sandwiches or even the meatballs (which are made of chicken). The non-vegetarian section of the menu is quite limited, which was a shame. Two dishes and a dessert set us back by about 1500 bucks, which we thought was quite decent for food that made us happy. I'm definitely going back for the waffles and the tiramisu.",Rated 4.0,3,10,??
Medha Sehtia,"Rated Staggeringly pretty and tastefully done. They pretty much nail the Italian ambience they are aiming for. We ordered the Peri Peri Chicken and Grilled Vegetables with Balsamic and herbs olive oil. I couldn't find a flaw in either. The balsamic dressing was amazing, the artichokes and spinach were my favorites on the perfectly done vegetable platter. The chicken was well cooked and flavorsome. The portion of the vegetables could've been more generous. We also ordered a portion of Waffles which were good if not extraordinary but definitely miles ahead of their contemporaries I have had in places in the North Campus area. Add to that a Cappuccino which was just fine. I have an issue about the bread basket, though, which is supposed to be complementary but wasn't served to us. A special mention to the prettiest restroom I've been to in a while. Three dishes totaled to about 1500 bucks. Going to come back for a few other items I had an eye on. Last words.

Chicken was nicely cooked and creamy white sauce was awesome. pasta in red tangy sauce was really good... was accompanying cream sauce by cutting down richness of the white sauce. Tortelloni was nicely cooked.. Filling was nice and white sauce brought up the whole dish up. Pizza senza as per description has mozzarella, provolone and feta.

I went there with a Friend after office. Its a small nice place with a Italian feel. We were seated near the glass window (my personal fav location). The decor was very soothing and good yellow lights add to the feel of the place. We ordered one of the Wood fired Healthy pizzas (their speciality) : Pizza Senza Pomodoro which was a white Pizza (no tomatoes). I am not a big fan of tangy flavor or tomatoes as a whole, so i liked it very much. We also ordered Virgin Sangria as have read a lot about it in the reviews, but i didnt' find it that great.

We ordered Baked Stuffed Potatoes, Caesar Salad, Pizza Sandwich Veg and Provenzale Pizza - and each dish was just brilliant! The icing on the cake was this brilliant piece of hospitality - I forget my credit card with the bill and I get a call within 5 minutes of leaving the place (yes reserving a table helps!).

We ordered the Virgin sangria and mojito for drinks and both were very good, especially the sangria. The chicken delight pizza was also tasty. The crust was exceptional.

They have tables to fit 12 people comfortably. Best is to go there for breakfast. We started off our breakfast with fluffy frittata piccante which were very tasty. The egg benedictine was amazing.

The ambience is really good with good use of wooden flooring, brick walls and colourful floor wallpapers gives the place a perfect look of an Italian restaurant. So, for the food we had ordered Pizza Senza Pomodoro, a thin crust pizza with toppings of broccoli and caramelised onion which was giving the pizza at tinch of sweetness ( I really liked that one, something very unusual), next we had Ravioli with almonds and butter sauce (another dish cooked to perfection) and then we had a grilled sandwich with a filling of zucchini, egg plant and tomatoes with cheese ( the dish was quite filling but amazing). For the desserts we had chocolate lasagne which was a hot brownie served with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. The service was quick enough and the stewards were well verse with all the dishes in the menu.

CombatCritic,"Rated Connaught Place, a very large circle (roundabout) in central New Delhi (a series of concentric circles actually) just south of the main train station, is brimming with shops (shoes, clothes, electronics, you name it), a massive Metro station (Rajiv Chowk), street vendors, a large park, relentless hawkers, and restaurants of all varieties. The large white buildings occupy an entire city block and are labeled sequentially with letters (A-L), making businesses a little easier to find. We spotted Caff Tonino while strolling one evening, shopping for a Kindle for my newest family member, a Tibetan Buddhist monk named Sonam who had been my pupil in Dharamsala. The exterior looked more inviting than most and the menu was comprehensive and reasonably priced, so we entered. The restaurant is nicely decorated in modern earthy tones and brick offset by more colorful and lively dcor, giving it a clean and inviting feel. The large wood fire pizza oven sits prominently in the back with a pizzaiolo cloaked in white with his large stainless stell spatula at the ready. We were warmly greeted and seated, one of just three parties in a restaurant with 15 or so tables. We found out that they have only been open a few months and are awaiting a liquor license in order to serve wine and beer, a rarity in India. The menu items, mostly Italian, are almost all spelled correctly, another oddity in India and a good sign, indicating that they have at least a reasonable understanding of the country and cuisine they represent. We started with the mixed vegetable antipasto, Antipasto della Tradizione con Verdure (440 rupees/$6.90), which came with grilled and/or marinated mushrooms, eggplant, onions, green peppers, and olives accompanied by two small crostini, one with a small slice of pecorino (goat) cheese. The menu claimed that it came with marinated artichokes with potatoes, sundried tomatoes, and tomato mozzarella basil, but we found none of these on the plate. The antipasto was accompanied by assorted breads, spicy diced tomatoes and an olive spread, nice additions, and was decnt, but a bit bland and a disappointment at $7.00, being nearly twice the price of an average meal in India. I also had the Bruschetta (95 rupees/$1.45), diced tomatoes on three slices of toasted garlic bread and sprinkled with fresh basil, which was very good and an excellent value. For our primi (main courses) my wife ordered the Ravioli Ripieni di Pere e Pecorino con Salvia, Burro e Mandorle (ravioli stuffed with pear and goat cheese in a light butter, sage, and almond sauce 380 rupees/$5.95). It was very tasty, light and savory, cooked al dente and a much better value than our more expensive vegetable appetizer. I had the Fusilli Carbonara (also 380 rupees/$5.95), a strange pasta choice as carbonara is normally made with spaghetti or similar pasta, but while tasting good, the bacon and egg were barely noticeable. Being a vegetarian country for the most part, I asked specifically about the bacon and egg and was told that the bacon was pork and the eggs, chicken of course. In any event, not tasting like any carbonara I have had, it was still very good and not too heavy on the sauce as has been the case at most restaurants I have eaten pasta at in India. In all, nice atmosphere, good food, decent prices (for Delhi), excellent service, and slightly above average value. The service was outstanding and the environment warm, clean and inviting. Their bathroom was the cleanest and best stocked we have seen in India in over two months here (Western toilet, clean, toilet paper, soap, hand towels).

This was followed by Pasta El Pesto, brilliantly done, lip smacking flavors. Drinks were ok-ish I liked the cucumber flavored culture shock cocktail. The Good: - The ambiance, done nicely. - The service, the staff is great. - The food, Flavored, I tried Italian for the first time and want it again.

I and my friend went to this place when we were too hungry and just wanted to hog on some good food. The sevice is very nice and the staff is courteous. The items on the menu seem to be over priced but once you try the food it does not seem to be too heavy on the pocket. We had ordered the Minestron soup.

Talking about the food, I would say they can do much better with it. We had ordered green order and ultimate virgin sangria from the mocktails menu, both of which were quite nice and refreshing. The veg platter, fritto misto di verdure, was also nicely done and served with some amazing sauces. The pizza, I would say, was not quite upto the mark. It was slightly bland and became very hard and chewy, just after 2 minutes of being served. In the dessert department, brle was not upto the mark, while chocolate lasagne with icecream was good.

Abhishek Gaur,"Rated This place is still unexplored, hence less crowded. But that's a plus because you save yourself from the unnecessary waiting times in not-so-good bars of CP. The ambiance is pretty classy. The seat arrangement is neat. The place won't make you feel suffocated even when it's packed. Coming to the food, I ordered 'Fritto misto di verdure', which is nothing but a kind of veg platter. And trust me, it's good. Like really good. Very well cooked, right amount of crisp and not a conventional veg platter you might have had earlier. So I'll say you definitely give it a try. I also order Bruschetta which was also very tasty and juicy. Just by looking at the quality of these two dishes, I can confidently say the the food this place serves is really good. Then came the dessert. I ordered Panna Cotta. That thing melted in my mouth and the taste of caramel was a cherry on the cake (wish it was a cake). And the most surprising part was the bill. It was around 800 bucks which I'd say is very reasonable considering the fact that I've also had chilli potatoes worth 500 bucks at some places in Delhi. To sum it up, I'll definitely recommend this place to everyone. You're surely gonna have a good time here.",Rated 4.5,8,215,??
Avni,"Rated I agree with other reviews that the ambiance and all that was really calming and serene, *Round of applause*. However, the one thing that you would like to have here would be a 'Great Breakfast'. Sadly, the pancakes that they served were really sticky and seemed uncooked. They fluffiness you want in a pancake was missing. Even bringing the same concern to the attendant's notice brought no relief.

Shashank Singh,"Rated Set in one of the bylanes of inner circle in Connaught Place, Caffe Tonino seems inviting from the way its signage is done on the facade. The interiors do well in keeping up with the expectations. The tables are well spaced out and there's a nice view on offer of the road below with some foliage in between. The promise of authentic Italian food lured us to this place. We ordered tortellini with spinach and ricotta in mushroom sauce, a gnocchi dish in tomato sauce, a wood oven fired pizza and a trio of crme brle for dessert. The tortellini was the stand out for us. The tortellini were well-sized and the spinach and ricotta filling made for good mouthfuls. The mushroom sauce provided just enough creaminess and wasn't heavy at all. The gnocchi in themselves were quite soft and melt-in-the-mouth but we thought that the sauce could have had some more depth to it. The pizza was thin crust and had some usual toppings but the wood fired oven added a certain smokiness to it. We ended with the trio of crme brle of orange, chocolate and vanilla. The custard seemed a tad bit eggy but It passed the ritualistic test of having a crunchy caramelised sugar top that broke with a snap! Overall, a good and satisfying meal.",Rated 4.0,1,1,??
Sanya,"Rated Walk into Tonino: if you are in cp and want good Italian food if you are vegetarian, and want to explore Italian cuisine Tonino is the only Italian restaurant in Cp, and offers a well curated menu and sumptuous food . What I like best about Italian food, it does not make you feel heavy after eating. And Tonino food goes by that standard. I went in during lunch time and ordered a soup, salad, pizza and a pasta. Being a vegetarian, Tonino has lot to choose from and does not make you feel left out. Salad ( - I have tasted caesar salad of many places, and the caesar salad here is good but not excellent. Soup(zuppa di cavalo) -I absolutely love soup. Although almond broccoli soup is non vegetarian soup. But staff of Tonino was kind enough to offer me the vegetarian version of the same. The soup was absolutely amazing, perfect consistency and taste. The broccoli and almond tasted perfect together. Pasta (arrabbitta)- The pasta was good but not extraordinary to give you palette orgasm. I love the fact that it was not overly strained with the sauce. Pizza (pizza sana) -It is a thin crust pizza with topping of spinach, basil and tomato.The crust was good.But somehow the toppings didn't go well together. The spinach was tasting bitter, which really spoilt the taste.",Rated 4.0,26,81,??

The tenderloin (buffalo) burger was juicy and I was given a choice as to how well I would have liked it cooked. I would have liked a larger portion of potato wedges but otherwise a great burger. The wood fired pizza was also good. The crust is very crisp, not particularly Italian if I am honest but the tomato sauce was better than most other pizzas I've had in India. The staff are friendly and helpful. The decorum is good. The music was a little loud the first time I visited but I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",Rated 4.0,8,2,??
Pranav Chaudhary,"Rated Caffe Tonino, an italian restaurant restaurant located amidst the circles of connaught place plays host to lots of foodies, teenagers and some movie freaks being located in the PVR plaza itself. The Restaurant scores high on food, service & Drinks but falls short in the desserts Section.After going through the well laid out menu, we finalised on Pollo Crocante, Peri Peri Chicken, Bruschetta And a Virgin Sangria.A long waiting period is demanded by the restaurant before it can serve you food which usually ranges in the 15-25 minute range.The Food Arrives and pollo crocante being the first i dig in, i find that it has the taste of egg batter overdone, as the taste of egg was actaully hiding the taste of the beloved chicken and the overall dish was imbalanced!Then arrive the Bruschetta, No complaints nor appreciation on this dish as this being a fairly simple dish to make.The part of the meal that i had been waiting for was The Peri Peri Chicken, although it arrived warm and not hot, i asked for it to either be warmed again or made freshly and a few minutes later i was presented with it, beautifully plated.I Dig in only to find that the Peri peri chicken has the perfect balance of spices, sauce and chicken to make it a absolute star of the afternoon. Special mentions for the plating.Now to Accompany these dishes, i had my companion, the dear virgin sangria which was also well made with grape juice and pieces of apples. No complaints in this department and was also served at the right temperature.A meal without dessert isn't a meal at all! atleast thats the belief i go by and to fulfill it i ordered for a Arabic honey cake which arrived 5 minutes later to my order. The cake tasted average but it was hard, it wasn't fresh and the cake was dry and hard and unlike the orignial arabic honey cake. This actaully disappointed me as it made the meal end on a bad note. All-in-All, a caffe with italian goodies, choose carefully and you will end up having a good time, their pizzas as well are worth a try (tried them myself, not included in the review) A Special mention to be made to the attentiveness of the servers and the effors put in by the staff for plating are appreciable as the plating for each dish was spot on.

Pankaj Negi,"Rated Oh Tonino! You have impressed. Right from the golf ball walls surrounding the staircase giving you a Mediterranean feel, to when you land up at the restaurant, the ambiance is refreshing and inviting. Although its more Greek than Italian to me (Design elements always are) but it's nice anyways. Segregating the dining area into three different spaces yet keeping it tied together has been done nicely, the passage leading one from the landing area to the restaurant is littered with cafe style seating and gives the place an Al fresco feel, so much so that I kept asking if they actually had one. Sadly they didn't. How long before the middle alley of CP opens for sidewalk seating and closes for cars, Rahgiri dinner anyone? Anyway we ordered a vegetarian Antipasti platter, which was priced at around five hundred bucks, but was completely worth it. As it gives you a chance to savor most of the starters within one visit. Special mention for the caramelized onion crostini, the tomato basil bruschetta (I think they had used oven charred tomatoes which gave the topping that extra flavor). Next was their famous Gnocchi in tomato sauce, the grilled tomatoes in the sauce did the trick again, I wish though there were more chunks than puree on the plate. The Gnocchi was a tad overdone for me but that's a personal choice, nothing takes away from the nice and tangy flavors of the dish. Kept from ordering the pepper steak, thinking it would be a chicken breast kind of steak (was priced at 590), checked with the server was pleased to know it was beef. Was expecting a petit plate, what came on the table was a descent sized steak with mash and veggies, and loads of sauce. I don't like sauce poured over my steak, will inform them the next time I place an order and I am going to order that plate again. The steak although well-done (as requested) was so perfectly well-done that it had some chew left, was not overdone at all (which I was half fearing would be the case) the mash was simple and basic, only carbs fat and salt, perfect! Must order for a meat lover. The draught beer was priced at 500 for a pitcher, which was a deal. They have to do a better job with the wiping sheets though, one of my beer glasses stank, upon requesting to change just the glass and pour the same beer into a fresh one, they poured me a fresh glass, which is expected but some outlets would only do as much they are told. Service gets a rating of 4 too. The only thing that disappointed was the Tiramisu, it wasn't bad at all but was that regular run of the mill over sweet Tiramisu that you would get at any standard outlet. Had it been absolutely fresh probably...... I don't know! All in all a must visit place for a nice evening.",Rated 4.0,46,131,??

Pratik.sg,"Rated I liked everything about this place! We were 5 of us on a busy Saturday evening, and had gone to check out the place during our short trip to Delhi. Though the place was packed, the usher, Varun, was extremely courteous to make an exception and let us in. The manager was efficient, smiling and completely aware of the menu, ingredients and offerings. He quickly placed us along the bar and assured a table on earliest availability. The food was quick to come in, and tasted great. We ordered for Kiwi Margaritas and beer (drinks), Buffalo wings, Salsiccia di pollo (starters), Chicken lovers pizza, Pollo alla Parmigiana (Main Course), AND sorbetto (desert). The only point that I could say as negative was the fact that the Margarita glasses had the sugar coating on the rim instead of salt, which we asked to change, and was readily taken care of. And maybe, the portions were a tad less (especially Salsiccia di pollo) for the price. However, the taste was great. The Wings were crispy n saucy on the outside and tender inside, just the way you love your wings. The wood fired pizzas were crunchy and cheesy (could have had a little more topping). The Parmigiana was nice n soft (chicken breasts), and the sauce had the broth-y feel. Warm n thick with flavors. The grilled veggies were a little under. The sorbetto tasted the way it should have. The decor is wonderful, and the service excellent. The spread is nice and the ambiance perfect. We had the best food of our trip at this place, and were treated very well. I recommend this place.

Wooden furnishings, white brick walls adorned with paintings and artwork gives a very turing feel. The smooth texture , the yellow tinge due to the natural lighting made makes the place look beautiful. We ordered the Margherita pizza and Gnocchi con pomodori. The service is fabulous and our gnocchi came really fast. Gnocchi is actually soft dough dumplings that may be made from semolina, ordinary wheat flour , egg , potato, breadcrumbs , the one we had here were made with potato and flour. Gnocchi in basic tomato based sauce and topped with basic leaves and parmesan cheese, nothing short of amazing for the first experience of gnocchi. It was served with two buttery garlic bread slices which were also delectable. Margherita Pizza freshly baked crust, with in house tomato sauce, cheese and topped with generous amounts of fresh basil.

The colors, textures are quite smooth and the staff was courteous. The person helped us selecting the best of the lot in thin crust pizzas and pastas. They have a good range of wine, especially chardoney. Chocolate lasagne dessert was something to die for. A shrimp appetizer served in a mocktail glass was made with a super tangy n spicy cocktail sauce and was good. They agreed to split the pizza into half veg and half non veg.

Himanshu Broota,"Rated Wanted to try out a new place in CP, so ended up here for a nice meal. The ambience was good and quiet. Nice place to sit and have a long chat with your friend. For starters we ordered Bruschetta and pollo croccante. Both the dishes would get a 4 on 5 from us. Both the dishes were crispy enough to get a nod from me. Next was Pizza Senza Promodoro. To be honest, the pizza was different as compared to other places and I have mixed response for it because the base looked too thin to me. The quantity of toppings could be increased. So may be a 3 would suffice. For drinks we had Green ever and Beets Beauty. Both the drinks did justice to our expectations. The desserts were a little disappointing. We had Gelato Fritto con Caramel and Chocolate Lasagna with Ice cream. The latter was better than the former but I believe the quality of the ice cream could be improved. I encountered less of vanilla and more of ice in my scoop. All said I would love to come back and try some other dishes and hope for an improvement.",Rated 3.5,21,120,??

Abhishek Bhalla,"Rated Tucked away in a small corner of H block, CP right facing PVR plaza, we decided to take our chances on this place to cheer ourselves up after a disappointing ALT+J concert. Entering, the minimalistic settings and the subtle colours are refreshing. French windows and bricked and colourful walls add to the rustic charm around. Wasn't too empty, wasn't too full. For drinks, we went for a peach iced tea and a Bond's martini. Very rarely do I like the peach touch in an iced tea being very partial to Lemon Iced Tea but this did it for me. More points for not covering the whole drink with crushed ice. Coming to the Martini, they pitched it perfectly. Delicious and not hard nut strong. Did take quite a while for it to get to the table though. Along with the drinks, we got a bread basket with olive and salsa sauce along with some bruschetta. If I could, I would have all that fresh bread and delicious seasoned sauces every day as a side. Full points! Don't stop yourself from Ordering a drink just for this. Coming to the mains: we went for Teriyaki chicken with Peri Peri fries. I don't know what adjectives to put down for this one! Was perfect. Nandos or any other brand claiming for Good chicken doesn't come close. Perfectly seasoned with the fries, this dish is a must must have. Next was the Golden Chicken Burger. Nothing great. The bun sucked ass. Patty made up for it. But again, on a whole, nothing great. Third dish was the Chicken Lovers Pizza- Light crusty pizza. Well seasoned. Good handful of meat. This one's for the original pizza fans. If you love dominoes, stay out of this one then. For desserts: we went for a Lemon Meringue pie and Creme Brle. The lemon meringue pie was the right temperature with a lovely tang. Was outright delicious and is a seller. For the sweet tooth a, go ahead! Creme Brle tested our patience. Almost took half an hour+ to grace our table. But oh boy, was worth it. Came with four different flavours and sent our palate on a ride.

Sanchita Dasgupta,"Rated Who went: Three people Order: Bruschetta, Panino con Pollo, Pizza Senza Pomodoro, Ravioli Di Pere e parmigiana Con Salvia Burro E Mondorle and Tiramisu Experience: First off, full marks to the ambience of this place; it is nicely lit, with muted music so that people can actually have a conversation and get to know each other. However, it is a little difficult to get to - I had to wander around a lot before I actually made it to the right corner where it is located. Another strange thing I noticed was that they had far more vegetarian options on their menu. Non vegetarians were mostly restricted to chicken. Now, the food. The bruschetta was good - crisp and soft, the tomato topping was impeccable with the flavours of basil jumping at you the minute you tasted it. The chicken sandwich was average; muted in it's flavours, we couldn't stop eating the fries which were delicious. The cheese pizza was really good too; I'm generally a big fan of broccoli though I wish some of the cheese had been slightly more pungent to add some zing. We ordered the ravioli because it was a chef recommended dish but it was quite strange in terms of taste and texture. The filling was too sweet and didn't really taste of pear and the butter sauce didn't have enough spice. The tiramisu was a fitting end to our evening - it was delightful! Best dish of the day!

Most places serve Italian as part of it and i often find very plain tasting pastas or dishes so i saved it considering it would deliver authentic cuisine. The food was great. We started with drinks & Bruschetta. Bruschetta was a light dish. It was nice and light, followed by 3 wooden fried pizzas. I don't remember the dish name exactly but all three were pretty nice. One thing i'd point out would be the dish named 'Filetto di manzo al pepe nero'. I hope i got the name of the dish right. This is a beaf steak along with mash potatoes.

I have visited their Mehrauli outlet. The ambiance of Tonino is pleasant as always. In drinks we ordered for After nine which is a dessert coffee and Must have. The flavor is a coffee base with mint and this combination can never go wrong. I ordered forCappuccinoFreddo, I didn't like it and asked our attendant KD if he can dosomething with the drink. I mean for my palette it was too strong and adding cream or sugar could have helped. But KD suggested me to switch my drink rather and I ended up ordering Oreo Shake. And I loved that too. We were given a bread basket with Olive and salsa dips. The breads are made in-house really fresh served with Olive and salsa dip - my friend was all gaga about it. We asked for some butter too apart from these dips and KD our attendant was generous enough to offer that. We ordered for Frito Misto De Verdure - A small platter of Mozzarella Fingers, Mushrooms, Beans and Zucchini fritters. Gnocchi Con Pomodorri - A potato base pasta with tangy tomato sauce. I am not a big fan of tangy sauces, so a spoon or two was enough for me. Loaded with flavors it is. And post this pasta I needed something to bring back my taste buds to normal and we ordered for Pizza Sena Pomodrro - Feta cheese, broccoli, caramelized onions and again some cheese. How was it ? I loved it. By the way, they have wood fire oven so the pizza is a must have. Italian Pasta and Pizza's I can never get over with. And yes, not to forget. I yet don't know the reason but KD came up with this Chocolate lasagna with vanilla ice-cream we were so stuffed I told him we had not placed order for desserts and he smiled and told us ""It's complimentary"" OMG ! I am so very obliged to KD and team for making us feel so special. And not to forget the food was as I expected it to be. And all this costed us some 1700 bucks. Perfect !

Brightly the server introduces the menu gives you enough space to enjoy the feel of the place. While I sipped my cups of coffee and my friends enjoyed a crunchy ceaser chicken salad the freshness was just about everything you can ask. But ,yes there is a but it can have a crisper bacon and courtons component to it . We ordered a juicy tenderloin burger, the presentation was a good starting point with potato wedges rather than fries. The theatrical component was of the onion ring place on the burger with a black olive and a red chilli it was served as a open burger. Tenderloin was too well done for my taste but agreeable to my friends. The happiness that the ambience filled us with made it a 3 hours long conservation and a happier bill set the deal for another visit.

Prashant Rao,"Rated If it hadnt been for a late night show at pvr plaza, m sure i would have missed this place with a blink of an eye. Anyhow sincee i hadd sometime to myself, i was attracted by a small yellow board simple yet honest as european as it should be. Nonethless, as i walked inside the stairs seemed a bit shady to me, as i didnt expect an accommodating space. But as we walked to the main entrance, it took me by surprise. The interior was marvelous, simple minimal chairs, cozy sofa, beautiful yellow lamps. Lighting inside was gorgeous as it had huge hanging lamps that was very signature, ut had nice stand lamps that emphasised the walls and ceiling giving a cozy feel. The kitchen was looking amazing, the wood fire oven immediately caught my eye, it just wanted me to taste its pizzas! The music was calm and really did justice to the place. Late night monday crowd was a bonus. To start i ordered some bruschetta: very reasonably priced, salsa was well done, served with a small pc of cheese and mint leaf. 9/10 Pizza provenzale : i personally went out and almost kissed the chef's hands. Splendid enough said. 10/10 Brownie with coffee icecream : eggless brownie, was more like muffin, i personally like more bite in my brownies. 7/10 Would certainly recommend to everyone.. must visit for a calm, cozy and tasty european cafe experience.. :)",Rated 5.0,2,93,??

Must i say everything is perfect about the place.Ambience,food and the courteous staff is the cherry on the cake.To start off the sangria is unbeleivably refreshing.The raviolli was thoroughly stuffed with pear and chesse giving that little sweet flavor to the amazing dish it already was! Moveover that doughy and heavy pizza's that you have been eating.They can make you eat borocolli over a thin crust pizza with enough amount of chesse that will make your heart sing.Thus i guess i need not say more about the place.I really am in love with this one and will be visiting it more and more!",Rated 5.0,5,26,??

Portion size is adequate for a person. Lasagna has cheese sauce and minced chicken! Pasta sana is spaghetti with pesto sauce (not bad at all)! I tried penne all arriabbiata too!

Here the menu is a bit compact but they covered each section. We started with beers and bruschetta. What amazing flavours, the best bruschetta i hav ever had. Then we ordered caesar salad with chicken and eggs. It was not very appetising to look at but was infused with flavours, so authentic that u feel u r sitting in italy and having it.

Isha Saxena,"Rated Had it not been for the mini shop that resides in the radiant yellow complex of Caffe Tonino, I would have most certainly taken it to be a part of Florence botched into an ordinary Delhi street. The Caf is separated into dining areas most artfully - the glorious white brick walls adorning the cafe and hints of sunshine yellow gleaming, finding its way from the walls to the crockery. The austere ambiance, vintage furnishings and effortless charm act as a tranquilizer. We ordered the classic (and personal favourite), Margherita pizza and Gnocchi con pomodori. The service is expeditous and we were presented with the gnocchi in no time. Soft, flavoursome dumplings lusciously wrapped in crushed tomato and broccoli sauce were absolutely delectable. Served alongside were two crispy, buttery, garlic bread slices which were very savoury. Next up was the pizza Margherita. Soft baked crust, with fresh tomato sauce, appetizing cheese and fresh basil. The thin crust dish is not only baked to authentic perfection but the flavour of fresh basil with cheese is very piquant. The place is ideal for a cosy conversation topped with Tuscany ambiance and scrumptious Italian preparations. A must visit. chompslurrpburp.wordpress.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Pallavi Mahajan,"Rated In the same building as PVR PLAZA, this restaurant serves food that is pretty much up to the mark but the prices are definitely on the higher side compared to the quantity. Along with the courteous staff and the pleasant ambience,in an almost empty restaurant (due to the odd timing we came at ) we were welcomed with light and refreshing water that was infused with mint leaves and a bread basket which was served with a spicy salsa sauce that tasted exactly like the Mexican salsa we have with nachos. We ordered 2 different dishes, both of them didn't satisfy me as much as food at my first choice : Big chill would, but that could be for my love of garlic and the fact that I've been going there since long. We ordered for, Tortellini di ricotta e spinaci Pavarotti, which was spicy and ricotta tortellini with creamy mushroom sauce and herb. I loved the sauce but a tincture of garlic I guess would have made a lot of difference. Anyways, it was perfectly cooked and the tastes satisfied my taste buds way more than the second dish. Our other dish was, Pollo alla parmigiana - which was Parmesan coated chicken breasts with spaghetti tomato in herb sauce, grilled veggies n lemon cream herb sauce. -the chicken disappointed me as it was nor cooked perfectly (it took hell lot of an effort to cut through) -there was no lemon sauce (it was as simple as a white sauce) After this main course meal we moved on to the desserts, We tried their chocolate lasagna which was sinful, with oodles of chocolate, layers of cheese between the chocolate and cake, plus served with vanilla ice-cream topped with chocolate sauce. A luscious delight for the chocolate lovers! Ambience : 4.5/5 Food :4/5 Drinks : 3.5/5 Food presentation : 4.5/5 Quantity : 3/5 Prices : 3/5 ( on the higher side, not at all mediocre ) Service : 4/5 (fast enough ) Staff : 4/5 ( courteous ) I'll surely visit you again and try something new and different before I make a final judgment :)",Rated 4.0,58,331,??

They nicely agreed to do a vegetarian version of the spaghetti with cherry tomatoes and bell peppers for us. The second time we went we got a snack board complimentary since we ordered a cocktail-- crisp nachos, cheese sauce, peanuts, a small piece of bruschetta ( very nice tho). Tried a vegetarian pizza with rocket leaves- nice again. So all in all a good deal and we had a great time and ended up with happy tummies.

Food: small portions, but they tasted good. It's rare to find well made pasta. The dishes were presented beautifully. The place also serves international choices of food like peri peri chicken which was brilliantly made. Do try the deserts, the chef special gelato fritto con caramel was towards infinity and beyond.

The decor and ambience is cozy and homely. A table for two is just the right size and distance. I had the Pollo ala Parmagiana. The Chicken breast was moist and the mushroom sauce was delicate. The home-made Tortelloni was just so good i could melt. My friend had the Beef Steak, cooked to pink with aromatic herbs on a bed of the most well mashed potatoes, finished with olive oil, zucchini, carrots, broccoli and onions. We finished it off with Panna Cotta with caramel and blueberry. Absolutely heavenly! Totally an episode of Masterchef Australia. The staff is very cordial and they know the menu.

Coming to food we ordered one bruschetta, chicken croqante, pizza sana, ravioli with pears and parmesan and a peri peri chicken with fries, full points for food. I really had listen a lot about tonino and that's absolutely correct, they are authentic italian eatery. It all costed us around 1800 bucks which is pocket friendly.

Varun Jain,"Rated We went here straight after the movie as this is just next to PVR's exit point.. At first we were really impressed with the ambiance, interiors and the menu, but all that ended soon enough. Firstly for starters we ordered the 'antipasti della tradizione' and we were told it will be enough for 4 people, but when it arrived there were only 2 pcs of everything including garlic bread.. Then we order one fresh lime soda, which clearly lacked the soda.. it was purely fresh lime water.. For the main course, we ordered one pizza, one fettuccine pasta and one ravioli.. The pizza was from the wood fired oven so was baked nicely but clearly lacked vegetables in a vegetable pizza, the pasta was so bad all 4 of us refused to eat it.. SO THEY TOOK IT BACK, PUT TOGETHER THE ALREADY SERVED PASTA FROM OUR PLATES, TRIED TO IMPROVE IT AND THEN SERVED IT TO US AGAIN (i'll leave it to you what to think of it), and the ravioli was very oily as well and lacked spinach filling.. and BTW, when all this was happening, the servers dropped atleast 2 dishes meant for another table on the way there.. The servers are clearly under trained and need a lot of work.. Price - expensive considering the food quality and quantity. we are definitely not going there again..",Rated 1.5,10,15,??

The little almonds were a delight and it was really filling. My partner ordered a tenderloin burger. I had never eaten a buffalo before and completely forgot that the burger had buffalo!

Got us the bill and when we said we were waiting for our waffles they said it would take another twenty minutes because the guy who took our order left. What kind of service is that! And another time I called to get home delivery and the distance from my place to toninos is less than 2 Kms as shown on zomato and they have a 5 km delivery policy but the guy on the phone refused straight away saying they won't deliver I am severely disappointed.,Rated 1.0,48,215,??
Girija Suri,"Rated Tonino is well located, close to the B-Block exit of Rajiv Chowk. Just upon entering, the exquisite interiors of this cafe catch your eye with brick walls in white and homely wooden decor reminding you of an Italian roadside cafe. I had ordered Fresh Lime Soda, Pizza Senza Pomodoro, Pasta Al Pesto and Flourless Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Icecream for the dessert. Pizza was good but not great as it was bland. It had toppings of mushroom,cheese and brocolli but the combination was destroyed by caramelised onion which was way too sweet for a pizza. Pasta Al Pesto qas quite good with sumptuous pieces of red bell pepper and finely chopped mushrooms and olives that i had specially requested them to add. Angel hair pasta was extremely well cooked in pesto sauce with a dash of olive oil. Not to forget the delicious fresh lime perfect in sweetness and saltiness. The dessert was really good and the chocolate cake totally sinful! The service was a bit slow and sweet onions disappointing.

Prakhar Bhardwaj,"Rated I'd heard great things about the place but I was pretty disappointed. We had ordered a spaghetti with meatballs and a chicken lovers pizza. The spaghetti's sauce had no flavor - usually a red sauce has some depth in terms of basil or some other herb. It wasn't tangy either. The serving was miniscule for the price. The pizza was sub-par, they're pretty stingy with their tomato base and the toppings had no flavor of its own. After these two disappointments we were handed a bill of 1400 bucks.

The Pollo croqante was good but it was a bit on the spicy side but that its my view as i don't like my food to be spicy but rest of my gang loved the dish. The peperoni pizza and the whole wheat pasta with light pesto & vegetables is by far the best I'd had till now. The drinks were good as well but the J.Balarina and the 16th was something which was new and innovative also these were not part of the menu and specially created for us (girls).

Hungry Khan,"Rated Went here today afternoon after watching Tanu Weds Manu Returns (a brilliant movie which you must watch if you haven't already). It's right behind PVR plaza, so quite convenient to just hop behind after a good movie for a nice meal. It's a cute little place, decorated with creepers to evoke the image of an Italian roadside cafe. The interiors are also beautifully done, with adequately spaced tables which let you converse without people on the other table overhearing juicy details of your life. We were a bunch of girls with a voracious appetite so we started with the chicken croquettes (forgetting the fancy name) which was chicken fried with a twirly crunchy batter covering served with a thick Mayo sauce. It was served hot and fresh with a lettuce side and was quite good. I would have appreciated it more if the lettuce was served with cherry tomatoes and broccoli so it would constitute a healthy little starter. But I patiently wait for the day when restaurants will start serving fresh side salads instead of the wilted dry stuff that's given out in Indian restaurants knowing fully well that it won't be touched. Anyway, we then ordered two pizzas. The first was chicken lovers pizza which had a healthy serving of chicken and tasted good except was lacking in cheese content. A good pizza is always 40% crust, 30% cheese and 30% of the remaining toppings. They did generously on the toppings but can improve on the cheese amount. But since it was hot and fresh, we wolfed it down. Then came my favourite pizza which was the Vegetarian Pomodoro pizza. It was a bit because it had a combination of a bunch of cheeses and the vegetables were fresh. Though I do wish they had used more vegetables and made it more nutritious. Sigh, a girl can hope, can't she? For dessert we ordered the beautiful chocolate flourless cake with vanilla ice cream. This was quite delicious. We then washed it down with an iced frappe which was cold but had no ice, and the blended cold coffee which was actually quite good. All in all a decently good meal. The service was excellent and I would encourage the staff to continue doing what they are doing. Bathroom was clean. When the music became too loud we asked them to reduce it which they politely did. They also were nice enough to keep refilling our glasses of water without being asked. I will visit this place again.",Rated 4.0,75,847,??
Karan Kumar (@karansayz )( Www.facebook.com/karansayz)(Famed Karanz Review)( Delhi/NCR Top Reviewer),"Rated Why Tonino When you are in a superb mood after watching a movie like Tanu Weds Manu returns and its close 45 degrees outside , you step to the nearest / best available place . Hence, cafe tonino. The climb upstairs is a decent one and has a old world CP charm still intact . As soon as you enter , you get a change of ambeince and seating. The seating is divided into an open gallery seating ( inside ) and the regular seating near the bar area and inside. Nice seating and good layout. Food We did not get the bread basket ( which I think is a regular here ) We ordered the Pizza Sana which had a combination of tomato , basil and walnuts ( I did not find any though ) and spinach . For drinks, sangria and Ginger ale Can. The order was fast and the food and drinks were good. Desserts We ordered and loved the Chocolate lasagna and the creme brulle trio chocolate , vanilla and orange . Both were very good. Pricing They have fine dining prices and a meal for two may costs close INR 2500+ . No discounts on any credit / debit cards . Strange. What I HATED It seems that our server / staff in general were coming every 5 minutes to ask us if we needed anything / wanted to order something . As soon as we finished something the plates got cleaned without asking if we were done. They all seemed to be in a hurry beyond my thinking since the place was more than empty. I HATED THIS . When there are two people who have come in scorching summer heat and are ordering as well , give them some space , some time and don't hurry things up . They may review you on Zomato and share an honest experience. Don't HURRY UP and give an impression that you want people OUT. Quickly. Hence , the dip in the rating. PS- Do read the management response/s . As they say , words speak the truth !! If this is the tonality , why would one go back again to this place let apart recommending to someone. With a service and response like this , even if the food is good , its of no use . karansayz.blogspot.com",Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Piyush Jain,"Rated For those who don't want to read much: Ambiance and decor - 4.5 Staff - 5 Food - 3 (for the quantity and the dessert, I deducted the points) Service - 4 The place is good for special purposes such as a meeting or office lunch or a date, but not recommended for a college hangout. Caffe Tonino had been on my radar for some time and I took the opportunity to go there today. The place's exteriors seem surprising for its location in the middle circle of CP. Situated beside Nizam's, it looks inviting. The ambience of the place is quite good for different purposes of meeting - a business meeting to a date and gets a +1 from me. Now, the staff - the staff was very polite, quick and knew about the dishes. A failure here is always a turn off. They were also efficient in their service, as they were quick to respond regarding our requests. Starting with the drinks. We ordered an After Nine and Vanilla Frappe, both of which were decent, but tasted primarily the same, only the frappe was one shade more bitter in taste. After Nine didn't have much of a minty taste, but the leaves were giving out some flavour. 3 for taste, 4.5 for presentation. Food - we ordered the Bruschetta and Tortelloni pasta. Here, I give the place another thumbs up as the bruschetta was delicious and surprisingly tangy. The bread was toasted as well as it could have been. The pasta was boiled and cooked to the right degree and tasted like a white sauce pasta should. The cheese filled bits were definitely a delight to eat. The quantity of food, however, disappointed me. I was left asking for more even after having these two dishes. So we ordered a dessert next. The dessert we ordered was Gelato with caramel (with a fried outer layer - I don't remember the name exactly). The concept sounded surprising and caught our curiosity, and as they say, curioaity killed the cat, here, our apetite was the cat. The presentation of the ice cream was something unexpected and looked like a snowman. That is the most it csn be appreciated. The outer layer was as hard as rock n Hitler's biggest guns couldn't touch it. Somehow we managed to breach the defenses n found that the city was already plundered. Everything in the dessert was as tasteless as water. We somehow managed to eat enough of it to satisfy our wallets, but it was a total disaster in every possible way. The two turnoffs were the quantity and the dessert. Otherwise, the outlet was a decent experience. My overall scores for the place are given above.",Rated 3.5,1,1,??

Jasmine Ramchandani,"Rated Cute cosy cafe in the heart of the city. When everywhere else you will get blasting music, come to Caffe Tonino for some sweet conversation. And ofcourse Italian food. It's great for a date or just a girl gang get together. Food tastes good. We had the chicken wings, Stuffed potato, Caesar Salad(really fresh and crisp), sausages, Chicken lovers Pizza, Pepperoni Pizza & Chicken Lasagne. I just feel the quantity was a little too less. Lasagne couldn't even be shared properly between 2 people. Overall we had a pleasant experience.",Rated 4.0,20,59,??

Ankit Arora,"Rated Caffe tonino: Situated next to nizams and a little 'have something for everyone' confectionery shop,caffe tonino is a dedicated Italian cuisine restaurant.. This Italian eatery boasts of decent European interiors with comfortable and formal seating.. The menu has plenty to choose from( may well be used as a conversation-starter at blind dates, provided you know how to do it right!:-D) The complementary assortment of breads with salsa and crushed olive preparation ( looked like activated charcoal but impacted the other sensations pleasantly) was appreciably good.. The vegetable antipasti platter was a treat to the eye..it wasn't as much of a treat to the palate but that maybe was a call to evolve my palate.. Comfort zone is a beautiful place to be in but nothing ever grows there right! Live music soothened the soul..such a beautiful reminder of how music can influence your mood.. The kiwi in pineapple juice mocktail was rich. The beetroot mocktail didn't mock either.. The totelloni pasta stuffed with spinach inundated the mouth ..a litte more cream though would have been gratifying. Go for a perfect romantic night with great Italian food..maybe it ends in great Italian love!;-)",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Srj,"Rated I have been to Tonino at Mehrauli and when I got to know that Tonino had opened an outlet at Cp so it was reason enough to visit it, and I did some time back. Caffe tonino is located opposite Nizam in Co. the setting did not quite create the magic that Tonino did for me but still the ambience is really good, & the ample use of wooden flooring, brick walls, art & decor on walls gives the place a good look. I went on a weekday and the place was empty so the service was really good, & the staff was really nice with suggestions etc. We ordered a whole wheat spaghetti in tomato sauce, a multi grain toasted Panino speziale alla caprese, & a latte coffee. The spaghetti was cooked to perfection and the taste of sauce was good & not so tangy at all. The open sandwich panini with Mozarella, tomatoes, basil & side of veggies was toasted nicely but the veggies did not really complement the huge chunks of cheese & the overall balance in taste but was decent. Latte was one of the best I have had. Bread basket too was not up to the mark as the breads were not fresh & were chewy. Meal cost around 1500. I would still recommend a visit to Tonino caffe if you are looking for authentic Italian food in the heart of the city.

At Rs 310, i was expecting the sausages to not taste like Venky's. I loved the Mashed Potatoes. I also ordered a cup of Mocha which was alright.

Shambavi Ganju Katoch (What Sam Says About_____?),"Rated I happen to be a Tonino fan, ever since I had my first thin crust pepperoni pizza way back in 2005 when they had their outlet in DLF Cyber city. I was enchanted by the taste of fresh ingredients in the food and the use of choicest world class ingredients. Its quite sad and unfortunate that so far I have been deprived of a visit to their Mehrauli road property which I hear is one of the finest and one of the most breathtakingly romantic properties in Delhi. That property is known for some of the finest Italian food served in the city today. The restaurant has earned love and respect of one and all who love Italian food. When I heard they opened their doors to public in Connaught place I was more than excited and was fishing for the next opportunity I get to visit Tonino and get transported in time and space to a Tuscan Villa, sip my glass of wine with cheese and enjoy a chit chat with a special someone. I happen to get a call from an old friend who wanted to catch up with me in Connaught place. What better place to enjoy a fine evening than Caffe Tonino? Located behind the PVR plaza on the first floor above Nizam's Caffe Tonino is a whole big world in itself. As one steps into Caffe Tonino one is greeted by a spectacularly relaxing Italian Bistro ambiance and setting just like an old Tuscan Villa in Italy. The place welcomes you with its old world simple yet eloquent Italian charm with a wood fired oven in one corner and large European styled windows, mosaic floors and floral formations and beautiful European pictures on the walls. Caffe Tonino yet again like its predecessor attempts to take the Italian cuisine to the next level by adding an international flavor to it. They do what they do best - use fresh world class ingredients imported from Italy to impart that authentic Italian taste to the food served here. I admire the fact they have not cut corners and compromised on quality if ingredients. One can have some real sinful and drooling food here ranging from a wide spread of antipasti, wood-fired Pizzas, deliciously creamy and cheezy home-made pastas and some sinful and divine delectable desserts. The place has the perfect recipes for the perfect meal. They have introduced a world class menu offering the patrons a great choice from their Italian favourites. However theres a new addition to the menu that will ensure you are swept off your feet. Its the Aperitivo! Aperitivo is a North Italian tradition that dates back to the 18th Century, which means socializing over drinks and finger food at the end of a long busy day. Caffe Tonino very interestingly happens to be Delhi's first Italian restaurant to introduce the concept of Aperitivo in Delhi. Aperitivo is a concept where people go to cafes/bars, pay for the drink and get snacks from the kitchen on the house. The origin of the word Aperitivo, happens to be from the Latin word meaning to open and in Italian one uses this in connotation of describing something really appetizing. For example the aroma of freshly baked bread or the aroma of Olive oil grilled tomatoes over basil are enough to tickle your taste buds and make you hungry craving for some food. Thats the idea behind the Italian Aperitivo, a little something to encourage you to feel hungry, so you can wholeheartedly enjoy a scrumptious meal. Simply put, its a pre-meal Drink ritual to stimulate one's appetite. So here we were two friends catching up to snack before dinner and decided to check out the Aperitivo Menu where Caffe Tonino offers a wide range of Aperitivo cocktails including the world famous Negroni, my favourite Bellini with peach Schnapps and Sparkling wine, Cosmo-Secco, Negroni Sbagliato, Kir Royal, Manhattan, The Bond Martini and the classic Spritz, garnished with a half slice of orange. What's interesting is the versatality in the finger food exhibited at the Aperitivo. The Chef at caffe has made excellent bouquet of finger food with some basic everyday ingredients one gets from the kitchen which includes marinated olives, peanuts, cashew nuts, platter of crostini, sandwiches, nachos, boiled egg with anchovies, cheese straws, chicken mortadella & more. Bellini - We started the evening and ordered a Bellini, my favourite Peach schnapps cocktail with sparkling wine. Loved that the same was served garnished with pomegranate pieces. A very refreshing sparkling cocktail that lights up your senses. A must have Green Appletini - This super Vodka based cocktail contains Fresh Apple and Green Apple syrup and is served very beautifully. As it is I am a huge Green apple fan and this cocktail really impressed me. Bread Basket with Salsa and Olive tapenade - Ah! the taste of freshly baked assorted breads with great sauces is such a divine experience. Loved each type of bread that accompanied the Salsa and the very flavorful Olive tapenade. Rocket leaves and Pear Salad- I am a huge Rocket Fan when it comes to Salad's. I loved the pear Salad in the Balsamic dressing with pieces of walnuts in it. whatsamsaysabout.blogspot.com",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Anshul Duggal,"Rated The moment I walked in this place, I loved it. It was just right. So lets get on with F&D. 1. They had this Apertivo concept going on where if you order one of the listed drinks you get a veg./ non veg. Snack platter free. The drinks were champagne with flavours and who doesn't like some champagne ! 2. Now brace yourselves people, the pizza I ordered was the veg. Pizza Bianca with 4 different cheeses on it with caramelised onions and shit, and it was one of the best pizzas I have had in my life. I am gonna go again next week just to have the same pizza. 3.

The ""pasta Sana* contained a pungent garlic flavor, but was good nonetheless. Also ordered the ""cafe freddo"" which was very refreshing. Overall a must go! P.S. - The sauces and dips they serve with the bread basket are extremely well made. I ate them without accompaniments, and enjoyed them thoroughly.",Rated 4.0,10,68,??
The Feast That's Life,"Rated This review comes in more than a month late. I had gone to Caffe Tonino for an event organised by LBBD (Little Black Book Delhi) called Aperitivo- A taste of Eataly. Aperitivo is a concept that involves a light snack in the evening, paired with cocktails that build your appetite for dinner. Yes! Food that makes you hungry for more food! It was a really interesting evening, wherein we were given 3 cocktails to taste, and then we had to guess the ingredients and then try to replicate those cocktails. Along with the cocktails, we were shown a demo of some Bruschetta with multiple toppings, and then were given the ingredients to make the same. And the best part? We could eat what we created! And the bruschetta was lovely. There were 5 different kinds- one with zucchini and pepperoni, one with a hung curd dip and caramelized onions (my favourite of the lot), one with boiled egg and tomatoes, one with gouda and roasted bell peppers (delicious) and one with parma ham. All of them were lovely, and the hung curd dip was so delicious that we polished off two bowls of the dip. We were also served cheese straws which were really crispy and tasty. The event was amazing as we not only got to eat yummy food, but also learnt how to make it and also about this new concept of Aperitivo. After the event, we stayed to grab a bite of pizza and that was really nice as well. Overall, it was a great experience. Caffe Tonino has been done up very nicely and the service was really courteous throughout. The yummy food, and the interesting concept of eating to prepare yourself for the next meal, surely makes this a place to visit! thefeastthatslife.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

One has to climb to the first floor to reach this place. I really liked the ambience. Its neat, cozy and gives a nice laid back cottage feeling. We were there for lunch on a sunday, but didn't find much crowd. We were seated and handed the drinks and food menu. They don't have a very elaborate and extensive menu. It sticks to the basic italian meal spread, which I found good. We ordered ice lemon tea, capaccino, chef's special risoto and pepperone pizza. The ice tea was very refreshing and the coffee was brewed very well. The risotto is one of the best i have had! The pizza was also well prepared but the crust could have been a little more thick though it was a thin crust.

The Speziata Con Polo and the Pizza Bianca were both good. The latter had some unusual toppings such as caramelised onion and thyme which made for quite a delicious combination.

It was more crisp than what I would have expected from a italian specialist restaurant. Overall the Pizza was nice but I had high expectations. For Pasta :- it was a veg pasta. It was undercooked by all standards. On request , server was happy to get it recooked. But even then it was pretty much the same.

Tanya Jain,Rated Caffe Tonino is a very beautiful restaurant situated on the first floor adjacent to PVR Plaza and serves some really fine Italian. I got to know of this place through Zomato and decided to have my easter meal here. Though the place offers a very amazing brunch menu but we chose to stick to the normal course. We ordered two caffe Latte which were really good in taste. In the main course we had Ravioli Di Pere E Pecorino Con Salvia and Lasagna con zucca E Spinaci. Ravioli here for me was a completely new recipe the way it was made. Unlike other places ravioli here is small packed stuffed pieces which can be gulped in one bite and were very delicious. I especially liked the new tingy taste it had. Lasagna was just one of the finest I had. With some well baked pasta layers and every thing well spread in the sauce the dish was pretty fulfilling. In the Dessert we had Tiramisu which was again very promising and added cherry to our meal. The total check was just Rs. 1376/- The place is beautiful in terms of its interior and ideas. With a welcoming staff and even more delicious meal one can have a wholesome experience. I am going to revisit the place to try its Brunch Menu for its very tempting.

I ordered a cold coffee and a chicked pizza, husband ordered a grilled sole. We werent in a mood for ordering a big spread..salad or pasta. We couldn't fault the food, was served promptly and well presented. But wouldn't say the food was extraordinary or exceptional, but good enough. Have had much better sole fish though, and pizza too.

Saransh Mahajan,Rated We got here on an early Sunday afternoon. We didn't know that Sundays bounces here are just buffet. No a la carte. We were four out of those 2 were fine with buffet but other two didn't feel like eating more than just a slice of pizza. So having full buffet would be a waste. Please make a different arrangement if people get there for just little food on Sunday. But ambience is very good. Peaceful. Soothing music. Staff is very good. It just gives a good feel.

Though they weren't really prepared to take us on at 1130, they made up for it by their excellent choice of dishes. I'm a sucker for salads. And they didn't disappoint there. They have a Pizza and Pasta station - it was fun watching pasta being cooked. Their Fish preparation was also extraordinary.

Upon entering, you will see white walls, colourful artefacts, a wooden magazine rack. The tables are laid out in a spacious manner. The ambience certainly shouts Italian and is quite romantic. We took window side table. There wasnt any spectacular view to enjoy, but sitting besides window in a place free from hustle bustle felt relaxing. Almost all the tables were occupied when we went in for lunch. The staff was courteous and the service was quick. We had ordered provenzale pizza, lasagne, virgin mojito and caffe latte. The baked lasagne had a wonderful flavour with yum mix of sauces and was made with ricotta and gorgonzola cheese. Since I went here 3 months back, Im not sure if I ordered flourless chocolate cake or Chocolate Lasagna for dessert, but whatever it was, it was gooooood! Mouth watering!

The pizza bianca with Gorgonzola cheese, carmelized onions, mozeralla and broccoli was quite yum and the carmelized onions offered some sweetness which complemented the gorgonzola.

Neeru Singh,"Rated Any given day, I would be happy to sit in a beautiful corner of Caffe Tonino and indulge in delicious pastas and pizzas. Sister joint of Tonino, MG Road, Caffe Tonino has been decorated as beautifully as its older sibling. The mesmerizing combination of white walls, blue and white flooring and colorful artifacts, make the place look splendid. The space has been used intelligently and every corner of the restaurant reckons a special mention. It wont be wrong to say that Connaught place has got its first certified pretty restaurant in Caffe Tonino. I visited the restaurant for lunch and took the table next to one of the large windows. The sunlight coming through the glass window rendered a very warm and serene feel to the ambience. The staff greeted us nicely and seemed amiable. Every service guy knew the menu well and explained each dish with much aplomb. So we went ahead with the recommendations and hoped for the best. We had: 1) Bruschetta (Rs. 95) 2) Pizza Sana (Rs. 395) 3) Tortellini de Ricotta spinaci Pavarotti (Rs 360) 4) Tiramisu (Rs 175) I must say I was particularly thrilled to know that they bake their own bread and pizza base, as I feel, nothing tastes better than fresh bakes. It also shows that the makers believe in serving quality food and value for money. Even the detail that has gone into menu design is remarkable. Chef Suman Sharma and team have done a wonderful job of getting the food and menu right. After a few minutes of waiting, Bruschetta arrived on our table. The In house garlic bread was toasted to perfection topped with the juiciest tomatoes, fresh basil and olive oil. This certainly is the perfect dish to start your meal with. Its a must have for all those who prefer to eat healthy. As soon as I finished the delicious Bruschetta, The Tortellini de Ricotta arrived on our table. It looked extremely appetizing. The combination of spinach, ricotta cheese, creamy mushroom sauce with herb oil is perfect on any given day. The sauce had the perfect liquid consistency unlike the sticky pasta sauce you get normally and the tortellini was al dente. The taste of spinach was subtle and the herb oil enhanced the flavor of the pasta. Served with crispy bread, this is quite a finger-licking dish. Pizza Sana was something that I wasnt too sure about, as it had a whole-wheat thin crust base. But to my surprise, the base was neither dry nor lacked any flavor. The toppings of spinach, tomatoes, basil, walnuts and low fat Feta cheese were tasty and further improved the experience of eating at Caffe Tonino. This again is apt for weightwatchers. The only caveat is that the amount of feta cheese is almost negligible. Off late I have realized that I tend to evaluate an Italian eatery based on the quality of the Tiramisu that they serve, in spite of other desserts like Panna cotta, Gelato, Sorbet and even Affogato, being available. My love for Tiramisu is quite evident and I have no qualms about it. So, quite obviously I ordered one here as well. This one had the right balance of coffee, rum and mascarpone cheese. Garnished with ladyfingers and toffee sauce on the side, this was happiness on my plate. The bill for this meal came up to be Rs 1300 inclusive of all taxes. My friend and I finished our meal, listened to some more Italian music and enjoyed the warm sunlight pouring through the window. Our day was more than just perfect after savoring such delectable food in an impeccable ambience. Caffe Tonino might be a new entrant, but thankfully it is the much-needed elegant Italian diner, that Connaught Place deserved. Buon appetito! eatstory.in",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

If you like Italian cuisine, like me, or if you want to try something new, do give it a shot. It would serve you well to note that it's a fine dining restaurant, so it might be more expensive than your average eateries. Might not be value for money, quantity wise but quality wise, the food was top-notch and exquisite. Ordering food might be a hassle as the menu is mostly in Italian, which is also a huge plus as it gives the place an air of authenticity.

Sukhmani Sakhi,"Rated A quaint artistically done up restaurant in the heart of the capital that seems almost a bit over the top as compared to the others in the area surrounding it. The walk into the restaurant heightens the expectations that fall short once the food starts being served. Ambience : Trotting in, it's hard to overlook the ambitious architecture and interiors of the place. The restaurant is done up in soothing tones of white and blue and there is a certain romantic charm about it that exudes class and sophistication. The tables are adequately spread out in this good sized restaurant and it is every bit of a rustic Italian place as it can be. Service : hmmm, confused much eh? I went for an early breakfast here so probably it wasn't their best time or they were just sadly off the game. The servers were dazed, food took quite a while to be served and once it actually appeared, there were not one but several problems with it. @ Food: The entire vibe of the restaurant and the impressive menu got my hopes up and well those hopes were certainly put down by the quality and the off composition of the dishes. Breakfast panino with Parma ham was over laden with vegetables which were unnecessary in a non vegetarian sandwich. The Parma ham was non existent and the flavours were just sad. Poached eggs were an abomination. The definition of poached eggs was changed. The yolk was solid hard and the eggs were stiff as opposed to the soft gooey original ones. Spoke to the chef and he apparent believed that poached eggs could be cooked two ways and theirs was different. Very strange and confusing! The replaced eggs were ok and served cold. The hash brown potatoes were super oily and dripping in fat. Not appetising. Side of sausages were again oily. Didn't like them too much. cappuccino and express shot were good. Verdict : I believe that the breakfast menu is certainly not their best foot forward. Would have liked to go here on another time because the menu looks pretty interesting and appealing. However my experience here was very poor. Cost/ person : Rs 800 Will I visit again? No.",Rated 2.5,136,1168,??
Isha Dua,"Rated Caffe Tonino is a great place for any occassion - a get together with friends, a quiet lunch or a business meeting over a cup of coffee. The ambience is better than coffee shops (Costa, starbucks etc.) and establishments which call themselves cafe/lounge/restobar. It is place which is now on my 'regular visit' list. I went on a dry day so did not get a chance to see/sample their alcoholic beverages. Being a cappucino lover, i will start by talking about their cappucino. A cup of cappucino here costs Rs 95 and does not disappont at all. In fact it made me very happy-a strong bodied espresso shot topped with the right amount of milk. That is why i say Caffe Tonino is now going to regular haunt :p. The second bevearge ordered was a dessert coffee called ""after dark"" - it was sweeter thann a dessert and not at all pleasing. Had to finish it somehow. Our food order consisted of Gnocchi pasta in red sauce. A very well made gnocchi- soft and melt in mouth consistency, complimented by a balanced (not too buttery or cheesy) red sauce. Along with these three things came the signature Tonino olive paste, salsa and bread basket (all three things complimentary). All in all a great visit.

Located in the H block, outer circle, if you'll walk a bit ahead of PVR Plaza, you'll find your way to a little doorway which would take you here.We were greeted with a warm welcome and taken to our table which was through the well designed place giving you a feeling you're not quite in Delhi anymore. Or maybe a little bit of that anyway.We placed our order for Antipasti della tradizione con verdure with Cappuccino Freddo and After Nine for drinks. The platter consisted of Caramelized onions, tomato mozzarella basil, marinated artichokes with potatoes, grilled eggplant, marinated olives and sundried tomatoes with a variety of cheese over some things. The preparation of the food was just amazing! It's hard to come by such cafe's which feel like the chef puts all of his heart and soul into the dish which is served. I loved all the things on the platter (Except the eggplant which I generally dislike everywhere) and I just can't wait to go back here and try what more the place has to give! In the drinks part of the dine, both After Nine and the Cappuccino Freddo took my heart away. I'll give some points extra to the After Nine as that was something different whereas the Freddo was just well prepared than the normal ones.

However, coming to the food, I had the Funghi Trifolati (mushrooms) and Salame Piccante (Pepperoni pizza). The mushrooms were better than ordinary and the pizza was good but both weren't as good as I'd expected, from what I'd heard about Tonino. Considering the mushrooms and few of the other items people in my group had ordered, the servings are quite small for certain items. Would prefer something like Big Chill over it.

Abhiram Bidwai,"Rated Caffe Tonino, assumably the second branch of more laid back fine dining Italian bistro in Chattarpur. Maybe I didn't choose the right time to give this restaurant a go, but this impression has put me back a little. Ambience - Located in Connaught Place, cafe is beautifully done. The interiors scream finesse and love gone into it. The rustic white walls and the big windows give you sense of sitting in a vintage setting Roman cafe. The zig zag tile work looks interesting too, sure to catch attention. Tables are spaced out well and the cutleries are good. A butter knife is included in the stock cutlery. Assuming must be for the bread basket. (wasn't served any). Customised printed paper table mats give out the attention to detail in branding. Service - Very prompt and courteous. Manager was ready to accept feedbacks, too bad nothing could be done though. Food arrived at a decent speed. Beverages/Food - Breakfast meal* Espresso was brilliant. Rich, dark and aromatic. Full marks. Everything went down from here. The poached eggs were cooked completely including the yolk. Manager claimed it to be a standard (?). They tried to remake it, still couldn't make it gooey. Prosciutto panini - The ingredients mentioned in the menu, I believe were swapped with the vegetarian one. The only difference was the paper thin prosciutto and egg. (It's completely different on the menu). It wasn't bad, it just wasn't what was supposed to be served. I also happened to notice an eye lash in my sandwich. Maybe they could pay a bit of more attention to preparation. Damage - 600/head (breakfast) Will I visit again? - No abhirambidwai.wordpress.com",Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Shambhavi Kumria Sharma,"Rated After a disastrous day, where we couldnt find the venue of a friends Reception in CP (Ashok Place), went round and round in the shadiest streets possible till we gave up and decided to go eat somewhere. People and cars appearing from everywhere possible obstructing our eager attempts to get closer to food. Cold, dressed to go to a party, hungry and no parking; it couldnt get worst. We finally after having tried Qba and Boombox caf found this caf called Tonino. This seemed the safest place to go; one can usually not go wrong with Italian. The place looked like any other Pizzeria that you find in any and every corner of Italy, yeah NOT CP J! I Simply loved the place, especially the window seating. No great view, yet you feel good with all the creepers around the window and the blurred view of people entering M&S. We were extremely hungry and ordered a half and half pizza-the best solution to two people of different tastes dining together happily. Veg-3 peppers, Olives and mushroom half along with chicken and red chilies for the second half. Garlic bread and Tiramisu along with a fresh lime soda sweet and beer both twice. The food was delicious; friendly people and simply awesome Pizzas! Wood oven pizza, extremely thin and crispy yet surprisingly not soggy. Simply perfect I would say. I love Tiramisu but have found very selected places that could actually make it right-this is one of them. Flawless and very well presented. After all things we went through, had this choice gone wrong, we would have lost it! The best part was, after porking out, the score was, surprisingly Rs1600!

The server suggested it when I asked for Bolognese as they didn't have it. And I would like to thank him for making my meal perfect. It was rich and developed and had a good balance of meat and tomato flavour. The only average part of my meal was the bread basket and the dips served with it.

Mehek,"Rated I believe this is going to be the first bad review for this restaurant and I am sorry about that. 'Twas Christmas and my spirits were high, well so were my expectations. So I entered into this restaurant, filled with glee and found it to be a cozy, comfortable little place hidden away in the heart of CP. The Christmas menu seemed pretty impressive on paper I'll say but the sad part, is that it did not live up to it in taste. I am going to get the bad stuff out of the way first. Well, the turkey, the symbol of Christmas was simply overcooked, bland and tasteles. The ham, not all that much fun either. Nor was the risotto, the Christmas pudding or the roast potatoes. Well, any of the mains. But what disappointed me the most was their pizza. When you go to an Italian restaurant, you expect a pizza that takes you back to Italy. Unfortunately, this one took me back to the confectionery shop around the corner. The staff is sweet, yes, but way too slow. So much so that it took them two hours and four reminders ( I am not over exaggerating here) to get my pasta. Now the positives. Yes, there hardly any. But they were quite big and also the reason for the 3 stars. The first one has to be the interiors. Loved them. Secondly, the drinks. I had a pineapple and kiwi one and another beetroot one and both tasted pretty good. Lastly, and my absolute favourite, the pastas that i actually received. The gnocchi and tortellini. And both were absolutely spectacular. Well, that's all and I am going to end by saying that even though everyone has given this restaurant all these positive reviews, it still isnt my no.1 Italian or Christmas brunch restaurant.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Food & Drinks: Pizza Greca (Gre-ka) is one of the best thin crust pizzas in town. It has a thin crispy crust topped with rucola, tomatoes and olives. The funghi (Foong/ghee) trifolati, a pan-fried mushroom dish was a little bland, but tasted good with the Italian breads and the olive dip. Must have! After nine, a decadent coffee dessert is chocolaty with a perfect blend of mint and basil. A must have if youre at Caff Tonino. P.S. The servers are genuinely happy to help you! Arjun is a fantastic guy and helped us figure out the best picks from the menu. The best time to visit the caf is either for brunch or for an early dinner. The food is light and scrumptious. Summing it up, Caff Tonino is a great option for an authentic Italian meal.",Rated 4.5,3,2,??

Foodie Ahlawat,"Rated Who went - 3 girls Time - Lunch on a weekday Bill Paid - Rs 1649 Ambience - Authentic Italian feel with good decors Value for money - YES! While roaming around PVR plaza we found Cafe Tonino ""Now Open"" board on the first floor. I am an Italian food fan so we decided to give it a try. The entrance is from the left of PVR & easily identifiable. The concierge led us to the first floor & we choose to sit beside the window in hope of sunlight on a chilly Delhi afternoon! The servers were very polite but the complimentary bread basket arrived too late (just a while before our order was served). It was accompanied by a really nice olive sauce & salsa. Our main course order was: Fish & Chips - 5/5 - The fish was perfectly fried with no visible signs of oil. It was accompanied by perfectly cooked fries and dips. Straccetti Pizza - 3/5 - Straccetti means strips of meat but I wonder why they named the pizza that coz there were pieces of chicken & no strips. The other two toppings were onions & mushroom. The crust was thin & crispy but I did not find anything extraordinary in the pizza. We also found the pizza to be a little sweet but couldn't figure out why (Surely the mushrooms cant make it so sweet!). Lasagna - 4/5 - Probably the oldest type of Pasta that exists. The one they offer is vegetarian with ricotta (whey cheese from sheep), roasted pumpkin & spinach so we thought of trying it. The lasagna was cooked nicely with the layers perfectly put together without making it messy. The cheese sauce was nicely spread but when someone orders a lasagna they expect it to be dripping with cheese, which was not the case here. However a simple dish that you can try for the pumpkin+spinach combo. I did not find anything innovating about the menu, just regular dishes that you can have anywhere. They need to think of how to set themselves apart from other Italian places. But somehow for the interiors & the service I would go again to try something different next time.",Rated 3.5,107,234,??

Nida Saifi,"Rated Wow! - is the first thing that comes to my mind, when i think about cafe tonino! Wow for the ambience, the infrastructure, the waiters , service and the food :) What brought me to cafe tonino is my love for italian cuisine ( and italian men too :p for i thought i might get to see one :p ) My order list wasn't a big one , so I ordered for some fried veggies ( i am sorry the name of the dish was too long and too much italian so i ve unfortunately forgotten the name ) served with tartar dip a nice light starter that was. For the drink , i ordered for some juice ( i dont remember the name ) but it tasted like the pomegranate and orange juice :p so i was left a little dissapointed on that part. The next on the list was risotto wich was awesomely delicious ! I ve had risotto a number of times but , this was extremely yumm!!! So a must try. The last was prawns served with a twist of taste of pineapple ! It was tasty i must say, but the size of the prawns disappointed me a little, and the prawn seemed to have been cooked a little extra ! But, as more of my attention was on the ambience of the place., i neglected the overly cooked prawn :p I ll surely go to cafe tonino soon again , because there's a lot more left on the menu for me to explore. :D",Rated 4.0,3,66,??
Mani Mahajan,"Rated Hidden in the beautiful lanes of CP is this quiet little place Caffe Tonino. The first word that comes to my mind when i think of this is Cozy. It's cozy and comfortable; a place good enough for catching up with old friends or a casual lunch/dinner. The place is decked up in white (a lot of places are these days) and have a comfortable seating. I have been to MG Road's Tonino as well and since i have a thing for outdoor seating, i love that one a little more. The servers were prompt and friendly. The server who served us helped me understand the ingredients and gave good suggestions. They can have the name tags on their shirts; that would help us know their names and mention them in the review. The minestrone soup that we ordered was very nice. Better than a number of other places. The amount of pasta in it could have been a little more but the veggies in it were a delight. It tasted really well. We ordered Bruschettas also and they were also very fresh and had the correct amount of toppings over it. Special mention of the complementary breads that they offer; I love them. The sauces served with them are also great. The combination tastes awesome. However, they serve two tiniest pieces of bread with their soup/pasta. Its disappointing. I love my breads with pasta and soup and I think they should serve larger pieces. The Pizza with toppings of bellpeppers, sundried tomatoes, and broccoli was nice but it felt a little dry; they could add a little more cheese or spread to the base. It was light and toppings were fresh. The pasta arrabiate that we ordered was average. We also ordered Virgin Sangria and Orange Bloom. I love the Sangria here; its a beautiful drink and the fruits were so crunchy; Sangria tasted similar to the one that I had at MGRoads Tonino. Orange Bloom was also good. Its a Ginger Ale based drink and was refreshing. Overall, I found it quite decent and enjoyed my experience here.",Rated 3.5,6,17,??

Anirudh,"Rated A pleasant afternoon stroll at the Connaught Place led me and the best friend to this cozy caf called Caffe Tonino. My prior research had made me fall in love with the ambience even before I set foot here. Reminded me of the childhood spent in old colonial houses. The nostalgia already reserved Tonino a soft spot in my books. After exchanging pleasantries with the very courteous staff, we were escorted to our table, subsequent to which, they were quite attentive while making sure not to be interfering. I had been craving some Gnocchi for quite some time now, so I ordered that, and was quite disappointed to have received a Gnocchi which was as tasteless as it looked. The unbalanced sauce reflected the amount of attention, or the lack of it, paid towards cooking it. I was quite saddened by this. However, my grief was short lived because the Crme Bre I ordered after that was just oh so good! One of the best I've ever had. It was plated beautifully and tasted even more beautiful. The custard was baked perfectly despite the unconventionally shaped ramkin. It more than just made up for the Gnocchi. We ended our evening with some painfully average Cappuccino and an After Nine Dessert Coffee. My visit was followed by a very sincere follow-up, which sounded promising, and would take me back to the place. I would've rated the place 3.5, but brownie points for the courteous staff and the ambience. A bittersweet experience over all. Well, more sweet than bitter.",Rated 4.0,4,39,??
Anweshaa Ghosh,"Rated Yesterday evening a friend and I decided to try Caffe Tonino in CP after seeing such great response in Zomato, The cafe is located right next to Nizam's (you are quite tempted to get in there as well) and it has a very welcoming entrance which shouts out 'italian bistro'. The interiors are cozy and intimate and very perfect to carry on conversations. We seetled in and were greeted by a enthusiastic waitress and decided to have bruschetta (i am very particular about the freshness and juiciness of tomatoes on a bruschetta) and a pizza bianca (which we were informed was a white base pizza). We also ordered a tonino signature cold coffee and a brownie shake. In the end we also ordered a non-veg pizza with regular toppings and chicken sausages. The cold coffee and shakes were yummy. I liked the bruschettas (i wld recommend you to serve 4 instead of 3 because its easier to split between), the tomatoes were pulpy, tangy and nice , though I would recommend toasting the bread a tad more. The pizza bianca with Gorgonzola cheese, carmelized onions, mozeralla and broccoli was quite yum and the carmelized onions offered some sweetness which complemented the gorgonzola. We ordered the second pizza to neutralize the sweetness of teh first one, but we were very dissapointed. How can one mess up a regular pizza. It was bland (i think it needs more seasoning), the chicken sausages were of the frozen variety that you get home and to our utter horror SWEET!!! I figured out that for whatever reason the red peppers were extremely sweet (roasted were they?). for 450 bucks, you wouldn't want a pizza similar to the one you can make at home (and which would definitely not be sweet!!). This pizza was bad.... The staff is very attentive and the interiors. Special mention for the loos...very clean and lovely smelling. (Usually one dreads using the restrooms in restaurants). We paid almost Rs.1700 for all of the food which I think is the usual Delhi standard now. Overall Impression: Good place to have good conversations in CP but have had better pizzas elsewhere.

Shubhi,"Rated A hidden gem in a LAAARRGGEEE place called CP. Tonino's entrace is something that you do not expect right next to the legend ""Nizam's"" right besides PVR Plaza, but enter the place and you shall be amazed. A really quite seating with beautiful use of very soothing colors and decor, this place becomes a treat for the eyes, with an updated English songs playlist that plays the most recent and loved numbers, a VH1 lover will like the place and the background score, at a volume that does not interfere with the discussion that you would want to have with the people you are with! Greeted by very courteous staff at the entrance we took our own sweet time to decide on the dishes (friends meeting after long took their own sweet time to chotter chatter and catch up on the time lost), yet the staff came to us twice to ask and politely went away on discovering (and noticing) that we would take time to decide on the dishes we would like. After a long time (and i mean quiteeeeee longgggg), we finally decided on the dishes: Bruschetta, Trifolati, Caesar salald and the Drinks: Besides the ones on the menu here, they offered a drinks menu with an interesting set of Mocktails. The drinks were fresh but had I think they mixed Real fruit juices to make the drinks, which maybe ruined them. The bruschetta was just average, but the Trifolati is heavenly for any Mushroom lover, caesar salad was a delight for the palate.

Anandu Unnikrishnan,"Rated I was here for a late late breakfast/early lunch, and since the breakfast menu looked great, went for that. Ordered the eggs Benedictine and the breakfast panini. The eggs were perfectly poached and tasted absolutely delicious. It was served with a thin slice of fresh salmon, which added a subtle meaty flavour that went really well with the egg. The panini was warm, perfectly toasted, and it's ingredients were inch perfect, though perhaps a bit too leafy for some. Washed down with some green tea (they serve Twinings), and I felt great to go. The decor ('tuscan', as their menu says) is very well done. Restrained colours, lots of white and natural sunlight make the place seem very welcoming. The only downside was the music - blaring out loud pop on a lazy Saturday morning. Personally, I would've expected some Chopin.

Connaught place remains a favourite since school days and now its back with a bang with so many restaurants using the terraces! Cafe Tonino is right next to Nizam's (Plaza Building) Service: Polite, attentive, smiling. Can't find a fault. Food: We ordered a beetroot artichoke salad with goat cheese to begin with. Easily an 8 on 10. Artichokes seemed the tinned variety so well. But the bread basket with yummy olive relish and fresh tomato-garlic relish made up for that. Pizza Sana with ricotta, tomatoes and spinach was 9 on 10. The first bite gave a wonderful woody smoky aroma which we loved! We wanted to save our sugar quota for the dessert, we stuck to plain water instead of ordering from a lovely list of mocktails. Surprise! The water was basil flavoured which added to the whole Italian feel. The ONLY let down was the panna-cotta. The gelatin ratio was all wrong. It was too firm and gelatinous. The accompanying caramel sauce just about salvaged it. Repeat value: Totally. Next time it'll be the meats. Hoping it'll be worth it.",Rated 4.0,74,84,??

Amazing coffee and more amazing was the cookie. (For this, I'll visit this place again and again) Perfect ambience ... and seating arrangement as it offers a certain degree of privacy.

Abhinandita Banerjee,"Rated We went to this new Italian cafe last Sunday for dinner. Having been to their sister outlet in Gurgaon (now shut, I guess) a number of times before and having heard good things about their MG road outlet too, I had reasonably high expectations from this place. I must say they managed to surpass those on most counts. This place is in the PVR Plaza building in H block of Connaught Place, right besides Nizams. Spacious, all-white interiors and Italian theme of the restaurant left me impressed. I absolutely loved its ambience. Coming to the food, the complimentary bread basket was more or less average while the accompanying condiments like Black Olive Sauce and a tomato salsa were quite delectable. We started with the soup, Pasta e Fagioli con Salsiccia, which was interesting in the sense that it was for the first time that we were having soup with sausages in it. White and slightly grainy, the soup came in a big white mug. It was quite nice. The quality of sausages was very good and adding to the overall flavor of the soup. Next we asked for their wood fired thin crust pizza, Speziata Con Pollo, that had spicy chicken and fresh red chillies in it. Must tell you, I was completely bowled over by the pizza. The zing that the fresh red chillies were adding to it made it a tad different from all other pizzas that I have had before. The quality of cheese that went into the pizza was also very good. Next we ordered a Fusilli Carbonara which is pasta with bacon, egg, creamy and black pepper sauce. Here we asked the bacon to be replaced by chicken. This again was really delicious, rich and creamy with the egg fused sauce giving it a different dimension all together. The chicken that went it to it was not your regular bland chicken; thinly sliced and well grilled it took the pasta a notch higher in taste. Full by then, we decided to give their Italian coffee a miss but could not resist ordering the chocolate lasagna for dessert. This again was superbly done. A multilayered chocolate pastry with whipped cream cheese in between along with a scoop of ice cream gave a perfect ending to our meal. A special mention for the service that was impeccable. The staff always asked our preference with respect to the order of the dishes i.e. whether we would want our soup and pizza together or one after the other. A meal for two was pretty reasonable at Rs 1,500 odd. Surely would come back again!",Rated 4.0,12,17,??
Varun Dubey,"Rated It's a new cafe located in the PVR Plaza Building right next to Nizam's. There are various seating options depending on the number of people you are with. Quite a lot of space considering it's a cafe. Just as I entered the place, I was nicely greeted by their staff and given a cosy seating in the corner. Coming to what I ordered: Fusilli Carbonara. Literally took less than 9 minutes to prepare although I was told that it can take up to 20 minutes. It was served hot and fresh. Taste was just perfect that's all I can say. This pasta and bacon combination is a total win for me. Along with the pasta came a basket of assorted breads and 2 dips. A salsa dip which was just about okay and an olive dip which was quite interesting. Chocolate Lasagna. After my meal I need a dessert to even things out in my tummy. (Sweet teeth you can say) The lasagna was hot and creamy. Vanilla ice cream scoop was also there along with it to make things better. This stuff just melted in my mouth. This is the first time I've had such a dessert so it was my lucky choice I guess. They don't have a liquor license at the moment but plan to get it in the near future. This would be an add-on to the great food and service they are already offering. Overall a great experience. Tasty food. Medium volume background music. Date? Family time? Friends? All possible here.

Thin crusts topped with delicious premium quality flavourful cheese and abundant veggies and meat. The complimentary warm breads with crushed black olives made for such a soul-satisfying appetizer. A big thumbs up goes to these star dishes: Bangers and hash, Speziata Con Pollo pizza and their range of healthy wholewheat pastas. Service: They happily obliged to our request for a fluffy frittata for my guest at the dinnertime. I am glad they very flexible enough to tweak their breakfast menu for our convenience. Drinks: They are yet to get a bar license. They do have a limited range of mocktails and beverages though. One minor gripe: I wish they start using linen napkins and elevate this luxurious experience a tad more. Paper tissues give a very casual caf-ish feel, which this place is just not. Its a level up!

Tulika Sharma,"Rated First time I saw the board reading tonino in CP near nizam, I was so happy to find it. but alas it was still under construction. So few days back while crossing it I realised its now open and serving. The place was located on first floor of PVR building near to nizam. The entrance was lovely with a big chandelier hanging from above in the staircase. The place is done in all white and had an Italian theme. As you enter the place youll find rows of black n white pictures of Italian streets hanging there. The place is divided into two areas. We sat inside near the wood fired oven. We visited on weekend and the place was nearly empty. We started with speziata con pollo wood fired pizza, a combo of pasta and salad for which we had pasta sana and chicken caesar salad. We ordered special tonino mocktail which was great. It was very refreshing and an amazing new flavour for my taste buds. The wood fired pizza was the best I have ever had. There is no doubt tonino serves the best pizza in town. The spicy chicken chunks and the mozzarella were really a delight for my palate. The pasta we ordered was whole wheat spaghetti which had chicken, sundried tomatoes and was prepared in pesto sauce. It was little bland for my taste. The Caesar salad was really fresh and left us wanting for more. For desserts we had chocolate lasagna which was a small piece of layered chocolate cake with white chocolate as well served with ice-cream. It was just ok, didnt have enough chocolate for me and the portion was really small. I was disappointed by the dessert. The staff was courteous and not interfering but always around when you need them. For a meal for two we paid around 2100 rupees. Overall Tonino is a must try for their signature pizzas.

Rajeev Nangia,"Rated Was a lucky food day for me yesterday as I was wondering around in CP and got hunger pangs at an un likely time , four in the afternoon. A quick search on Zomoto told me I was near cafe Tonino , well a cafe Tonino in CP ? I had found memories of eating at a cpl of restaurants with same or similar name ( were they from the same promoter / chef ?) , one on M G Road and the other one in WIPPS Center , GK-II , anyways decided to head there for a mid evening meal. First , the entrance to the place is not through the front of the building but from the middle circle side , just before the legendary restaurant , Nizams , through a nice white door. One claims IPA short flight of stairs to beautiful and bright villa in the Italian countryside. Done up predominantly in whites and yello the place is a delight to eyes. With the place divided into three rooms separated by thick brick walls painted white , quite unique hanging lamps on each table and most beautiful , large bay windows in each room. All in all a very relaxing layout which made me fall in love with the place as soon as I entered . The wait staff was very pleasant , welcoming and quit well informed about the food , except he did not know what the soup of the day was , so he had to go back to confirm and tell me that it was cream of broccoli . Any ways he was efficient , refilling water in my glass promptly and assuring me that my order will be out momentarily , nice chap. After settling in and going through quit an extensive menu. , I decided to keep it light and order just a soup and a insalata Caprese and a classic Minestrone . The server was nice enough to ask me my preference for food service , did I want my soup before my salad or vice versa or booth together , a very nice touch which I highly appreciated. While waiting for my food I was served a nice bread basket with 4-5 different varieties of breads , tools and soup sticks accompanied by a fresh and robust tomato salsa and a Presto sauce, booth quite nice tasting. While I was enjoying the breads was served with the salad looking quite nice. So first the good things about the salad , the basil was fresh and flavour full , the Pine nuts and olives topping the dish added a nice crunch and flavour to the salad and the greens on the side were real fresh and loaded with flavour and now the not so good , for my liking the salad was under dressed , rather to the point of being nude , with no dressing at all , just seasoned with the same pesto that came with the bread, but that was easily rectified as the only dressing this dish needed , to my mind , was a big dab of olive oil , which was right there on my table. For what I did not like next in the dish , am not sure who to blame, the chefs at the restaurant who procure the produce or Pepsi and other multinationals for genetically modifying our tomatoes so much that now most of the stuff you find on the shelf a is all pulp and no flavour , so though difficult am certain the chefs of an establishment that serves such great food should also work harder at getting more flavour full tomatoes than the bland ones served to me on that salad. Oh and befor I forget the tomato jelly on the salad was quite innovative and refreshing. A 3.5 out of 5 dish for certain. The empty salad plate was promptly replaced with a giant cup half filled with yum smelling broth , which I was soon to discover , not only smelled yum but actually tasted better. Perfectly balanced tartness , wonderfully seasoned , the right kind and quantity of vegetables , in short , perfect. Well that was all I ate there yesterday passing over the delicious sounding deserts but am surely going back for more some time soon and would highly recommend this restaurant for the entire experience .

Karan,"Rated Tonino is the name that first comes to your mind whenever there is a discussion about fine dining Italian places in the Indian Capital and obviously I was super excited when I heard about the new Caffe Tonino in Connaught Place (CP). CP, to begin with, didnt seem to be an appropriate place for a fine dining Italian restaurant but read along to find why I was wrong. A quaint little entrance in the alley next to plaza and the super busy nizams was the beginning of a wonderful evening that I spent there with friends. The dcor of the restaurant gives you a feel of a caf in Istanbul. I have to admit that while I was climbing the stairs (its on the first floor) I couldnt imagine that it was so spacious inside with two separate seating areas. The staff was extremely polite and we were then given the set menu to choose from I say set menu as caffe tonino was kind enough to invite us before they opened the restaurant for the public. Our evening started with salads and I loved the salad with rocket leaves, just yum anyone visiting this place should definitely try this. I must admit that I have a weakness for prawns and after the assorted salads we moved on to just that prawns. Beautifully cooked and with the dips that were offered on the side made this dish just perfect! We were then served tuna paninis and the trademark caffe toninos Pizza Sandwich these are 2 pizza bases stuffed with cheese and herbs and meat/vegetables all this baked in their spacious wood fired oven, a recipe for success. It is an extremely rich dish but a must try while at the caffe. It was then the chicken thin crust pizza and the tortellini that were brought to the table. While the pizza was good, the spinach tortellini I must admit could have been better. This was followed by desserts and the classic tiramisu was delicious. And now why CP is not all that bad a location during our discussions with the manager we found out Caffe Tonino also has an elaborate breakfast menu and while CP is full of offices it does not have any good breakfast options yeah, I know there is starbucks now but who wouldnt like an egg Benedictine for breakfast. All in all, a good place for an evening with friends or family. All the best. Karan",Rated 4.0,110,844,??
Amrita Michael,"Rated Pretty piece of Tuscany hidden in an inconspicuous lane next to PvR Plaza. The ambience is warm and cosy. I was in a bit of a rush therefore I didn't take enough time on the menu. I ordered a burger, not a Tuscan specialty, but it was really good. The patty had a lot of flavour. The bun could be be softer. The desserts menu had me confused. Everything on it was a calorific dream. Settling for a chocolate lasagna, I wasn't disappointed. All in all a good experience and I would definitely going back for the specialty items",Rated 3.0,10,82,??
Prabhjit Singh Walia,"Rated This is a newly opened Cafe in Cp near the Iconic Nizam's. It's a cafe version of Tonino in mehrauli , where i personally havent been to. US- 2 friends in their mid 20s. Ambience - The entry is all white and the brick type feel accentuated the italian feel. The music that was playing was very nice , subtle enough to let people chat whilst prominent enough for you to notice. Food- We were frankly not that hungry and were just looking to sit and chat.I wanted to order a Lasagna but was disappointed to know that they only had one variety in it nonetheless ordered ""con zuca e spinachi Lasagna"" , It was good , just the way it should be but Have to say The portion size could have been better. Drinks- Ordered ""After Nine"" and the regular cappuccino , i was surprised because of the distinct taste of fresh mint in that drink After Nine , it was very strange yet something i really liked , i would recommend that to anyone who likes mint. Cappuccino was good enough.one thing worth appreciating is that they start off by providing a few breads with a couple of sauces irrespecive of your order i guess. That kinda Thought is good. Service -- impeccable , as courteous as they could be, The place is new so i hope it remains that way.",Rated 4.5,32,68,??

Nishtha Batra,"Rated This is place is a must go, i went there with a friend of mine and we ordered chicken platter (i don't remember the correct name). When we tasted it we found the chicken was smelly and complaint about it. we then told them to replace our order with penne arbirita, which tasted amazing. The best part, they didn't charge us for the starter we sent back in addition the staff was very friendly and food service was super quick.

Sonakshi Khuntia,"Rated So my sister and I had been seeing this little place coming up right next to nizams in CP and we couldnt wait to try it. We decided to go there for lunch and it turned out that they werent open yet! The owner told us that they would be opening up in a couple of days but they had a food tasting menu and insisted that we try that. We decided to give it a shot and ordered the beet juice, a cold coffee, a chicken burger and a tortellini with ricotta and spinach. The beetroot juice was so refreshing! I never knew beetroot could taste so goooodd. The cold cofee was frothy, creamy, not too sweet and not too strong- just the way i like it! Moving on the main course..the tortellini was cooked al dente. The filling of ricotta and spinach was delicious and the creamy mushroom herb sauce was simply lip smacking. The chicken burger was huge! Made with a juicy chicken patty, it contained fresh tomato slices, lettuce, cheddar cheese, pickle and caramelised onions. Every mouthful was bursting with flavour. I had sauce dripping all over my fingers but it was totally worth it! The burger was accompanied with fries and a spicy mayo. The fries were crisp and u could feel the crunch in every bite. Also they were sprinkled with some seasoning which gave it a kick! We were sooooo full that we could not try their deserts. However i will be going back soon! I also cannot wait to try their frittatas and waffles from their brkfast menu. Eagerly waiting for them to open up!",Rated 4.0,5,7,??
