Riya Sahu,Rated I found the place good with the dcor and the ambience. There were two separate areas for eating and we chose the blue one which had all underwater things decorated on the walls. The starters came one by one and we had the freedom to have unlimited amounts of everything. All the food items like the kebabs and butter chicken were nice and the breads were fluffy and soft. The desserts also had 2-3 varieties of pastries and ice creams and were equally nice. Just found it good for having party here as the prices are a bit much for a regular affair.,Rated 4.0,3,28,??
Vipul Dhawan,"Rated From their facebook ad I come to know about their valentines offer which is 2600 for couple. I am a already visitor of their Gurgaon branch so I have booked the table here in advance. But for my gf its the first time to visit this place. She got amazed with the interiors and decoration they have done. Plus they offered us one valentine's special cake and gift for my gf which was like cherry on a cake for her and me as well as I was not carrying any gift for her. Just missing the open area, the Jungle Jamboree at CP is the same like the one in Gurgaon. I am delighted as I get to visit both the places, though at a long interval, loved it the same way I liked my dining at the Gurgaons JJ. The food was in fact delicious over here and the ambience was cozier and lighter. The food as usual, the bhindi, Dal, starters, desserts, all were the same and equally delectable and all in all both the Jungle Jamborees are good place to visit.",Rated 4.5,19,103,??
Ankit Kalra,"Rated You want to spoil your evening ? Are you really irritated of someone and wish he/she never ask for taking to restaurant again in life ? Do you love to waste your money ? Then this is the right place and you are having bunch of people (Staff), who'll really help you to make this possible. I opted to try this place on Valentine Day and trust me, this was the biggest mistake of my life. They are providing you the Online and Phone booking service, but somehow, they are not capturing names in their list(s). You will have to struggle and then they will say sorry now we will make your entry and you will get another appointment of 1 Hr later. There were several Guests complaining about the same story and for every thing, they were having only one excuse, ""Sir Its too crowdy today, so mistake can happen"". So somehow we managed to get our booking after 45 mins - 1 Hr ahead of schedule. So MIS-MANAGEMENT is noticed. The other shock was, they were charging for the Buffet while entering to the restaurant. So, somehow, the concept of a Club / Disco Theque was copied, which is (as per my personal opinion), NOT AN IMPRESSIVE APPROACH, in case of restaurant. Also it was a package of Rs 2599 and they are punching Rs 2600 even when charging from Card machine. Its not about a rupee but if you are charging from Card, then you can punch the exact amount. Morever, you are not getting any bill for this. Let's talk about AMBIANCE, which was the main reason, pulled me up to visit this place. It was so so kind of ambiance, with lack of cleaning. They tried making it a Jungle feel, but unfortunately not completely able to do it. TABLES were dirty and Grill Lid will remained open, till the time the guy grabbed a Grill for us, which took approx 15 mins. At the same time we were given Water Glasses (Unlike other Restaurant, they didn't even asked which Water I'll prefer). The shocking part was, i found that my Glass is but not cleaned. When I looked carefully, it was LIPSTICK ON THE WATER GLASS edge, that means it was not washed properly. When i complaint about it, then they came with aplogise face and changed our glasses and water. Moving into the Order, I was surprised, that they just need to ask that will I take Veg or Non Veg and One Drink name, so they came with a Notepad and started writing the details. Not sure if they can't even remember this. The Served STARTERS and SNACKS were fine in taste. Started with a Golgappe, Galoti Kabab, Sweet Corn, Paneer Tikka, Mushroom, Salsa Potato, Soya Chaap etc were good in taste. However, when we had this once, in spite of bringing and repeating, they came and ask ""Sir do you need anything more to be repeated"". As per me, the approach would be that they should come with couple of items at least twice and then ask this. The MAIN COURSE was so so in taste. Very Very limited options of SALADS in comparison to other BBQ places. They were having both Veg and Non Veg salads placed together, without any note mentioned. Overall, a Worse ever Valentine Dinner I had and special thanks to this place. I feel that my money is wasted. Readers, please go to any other BBQ Restaurant. If you'r not getting availablity, have a Dinner at any Dhaba but avoid this place.",Rated 1.0,144,161,??

Sawan Chalise,"Rated Jungle Jamboree - A delightful place..... This is my 100th review on Zomato and I wanted it to be very special. I chose the day of Valentines Day to mark my 100th restaurant and I am happy that all had gone as planned. Here, I will not be giving just an ordinary review but will elaborate my entire experience. After frantically going through all the possible places to celebrate our Valentines Day, I settled with Jungle Jamboore as they seemed to be the only restaurant that had Valentines celebrations going on through out the day. Most of the others had only Dinner options. The place was overbooked which was a sign that the place does have a special place in CP. After a bit of waiting, we were taken to the first floor and directed towards our seats. We would have never got such a seating arrangement anywhere else. Cozy corner seats at the jungle area that accommodates 4 tables in all. Special thanks for the seats. After settling, we were given the special heart shaped cake and this brought smiles on our faces. We were already expecting it as it was part of the deal but still the cake was lovely. Two glasses of drinks were served as per our preference. Within seconds, the starters began to pour but we got busy cutting our Valentines Day cake. After cake cutting it was time to concentrate on the food. Nachos, Fruit salad, mini kachodi, fish fry, Spicey corn and many other items later, the barbeque was set. Another set of Veg and Non-vegetarian starters were set on the coal and after minutes we had them on our plate. And we were already full. After relaxing for a moment, we went to the buffet area and had our meal. By the time we picked up our mains, the staff enquired about our choice of bread. We ordered for lacchha Paranthas. By the time we reached our table with the mains, the lacchhaa Paranthas were already on the table. Well done guys. After the heavy attack of food, we went for the desserts. And then we were famished. Before we could complete our food, they presented the girl with a special gift which was pretty beautiful. A glass rose. Thanks Again Guys. Jungle Jamboore has a wonderful ambience with a huge area dedicated to the jungle theme and another area for the aqua theme. I was happy that we had been at the Jungle Theme and I felt we had got the best seating. The place is completely green on one end and beautifully blue at the aqua area. The place is decorated with life sized structures of animals and mammals all over. The food is perfect and mind you, having a seven course meal is no child's play. Most of the items did meet our expectations and obviously some didn't but that's the joy of eating a seven course meal. You should not love everything. The buffet was laid in a tempting manner and the mutton rogen josh was an amazing delicacy. The Kurkure Bhindi however disappointed me a bit and turned out to be too oily. Overall food was great with very less to complain. The staff looked tired but did their best to keep us satisfied. They did succeed entirely in our case but I see that not all customers were happy with them. The staff needs to tighten their laces here. With 2600 as their fixed amount for a couple, with an elaborate seven course meal accompanied by cake and gift, I felt Jungle Jamboore was one of my best spent 2 hours. Minusing 0.5 for service and value for money for obvious reasons. Food - 4.5/5 Service - 4/5 Ambience - 4.5/5 Value for money - 4/5 Overall - 4.5/5 Cost for two - 1500 on normal days. Nearest Metro - Rajeev Chowk (Gate number 7-8) Note - Jungle Jamboore is an enjoyable experience and must visit under every circumstance. The ambience based on the jungle theme is not everyone's cup of tea. The place has repeat value as one cannot cover everything on a single visit. Will definitely visit soon again. Thank You Jungle Jamboore for such a memorable experience and for making our Valentines Day special. Thanks a ton.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Akanksha Shri,"Rated For the ambience, I would want to give it full marks. They have tried their level best to entertain the customers in the best possible ways. If you get your kids along here, they have got a separate kids section to facilitate them as well. For the food, Id say some of the items really exceeded my expectations, like I never had such tasty grilled fish before and virgin mojito was also quite unique in here. There were also several items that surprised me, positively, like the Paan Ice Cream. I had it here for the first time and really loved it",Rated 4.5,4,42,??
Abhimanyu Bhasin,"Rated Hi I am a regular customer of Jungle Jamboree Gurgaon, I did a mistake on going on 14 feb 2016 yesterday for the first time to there new CP branch. The worst experience after booking a table hours back and having my name on the list for 9:00 pm I got the table at 10:10 pm where in people coming after me were allowed to go. after that for the first time I saw a restaurant charging your card first for the buffet. It was a valentine's Special Package with 7 course meal and a gift for the lady, cake and 2 glass of wine. 7 Course I will tell you what I got 1) fruits 2) filled golgappa 3) chicken tikka 4) chicken wings 5) 2 types of fish 6) lemon tikka 7) took food after that When asked the waiter what are there in veg as we took nonveg buffet for the first time I heard him saying you can not get a veg stater if you have taken a nonveg. Boss I must tell you Jungle Jamboree Gurgaon 7 course meal is what we call 7 course meal. The Service was so bad that they never came to table after serving above 6 items to repeat. We were asking like beggers to repeat. Cake was asked 5 times, finally I shouted badly on floor to get the glass of wine and what to tell you about the gift when was opened reaching home the crystal flower stick was broken already packed and rapped in a box. The manager on floor were donkeys wearing a blazer as whoever shout will get the service. After eating Food we got to know they have pizza and Nachos also in starters as our next table were served with the same. When we talk about the food in buffet it was like we have come to a marriage and the dinner is finished, ice cream was melted(Pan), Brownie was finished, Curd was finished and look at the staff they were not bothered to refill it cause they were busy chatting to each other and ignoring the customers. This was the worst experience and I spoiled my and my spouse day by visiting here. I promise this was my and my friend family last visit to Jungle Jamboree either Delhi or Gurgaon, I will make sure no one known to me visit you guys ever.",Rated 1.0,2,1,??
Amardeep Sethi,"Rated Went there on Valentine's Day It just an other restaurant with live grill The taste is just ordinary Waiters look lost and have to be called again n again for same thing Ambience is a mere disappointment, I thought it will have some exciting things for kids but as I said it was a disappointment",Rated 3.5,49,35,??
Amita Singh,"Rated I liked in here whatever I got to experience. Usually we go to a place, have food and comes back. But here it was different, the interiors made it different. I was with my cousins kids and they immediately went in the kids section and it gave us adults ample time to have a good talk over food. Otherwise it becomes too problematic to manage kids with food. There were no flaws in any of the dishes we had here and loved most of them. Only the mutter tikki and kebabs were a little average but the other items like dimsums, corn, nachos, noodles, curry, raj kachori and what not; all were amazing.

Neha Kapoor,"Rated I wonder how such beautiful restaurants ideas come in the mind of their creators. When I went to the Gurgaons Jungle Jamboree, I returned satisfied. The food over there surprised me to great lengths; especially the thing that they were unlimited! The CPs one is equally amazing and incredible; especially the food and the ambience. I opted for the Veg Buffet!! From starters to the desserts, all items were tasty, the pizza, chilly potatoes, kurkuri Bhindi etc etc for that matter.

Pulkit Gupta,"Rated I finally made a visit to Jungle Jamboree considering I have been wanting to try it since longtime!! Before I write the review.. I must suggest everyone to do prior booking for buffet here as it is very difficult to get one!! I really struggled to get it which honestly had put me off. However, after managing to get the entry.. I was relieved! The place is honestly bit dark which is again too much after a point. But, even then the decor and ambience despite being kiddish is beautifully done and nice!! The buffet is elaborate.. With a wide range of starters (including pizza, veg galouti kebab, nachos with salsa, dimsums and lot more). The main course is again elaborate with a huge range of North Indian Mughali, Italian (yes, they offer lasagne in buffet, pasta, and Chinese) . Again, the sweets were elaborate and had wide range. Loved their pan flavour Ice cream. Honestly, the buffet is nice but the price is not worth it. It costed Rs: 1250 per head on weekend which they don't tell on Zomato. I will cut 0.5 marks for over charging which is much cheaper with other buffet places. The Indian grill company, barbecue nation score above it only because their buffet is cheaper!! USP - Galouti kebab and other buffet starters mainly! But, expensive buffet.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Shalu Gaur,"Rated I liked everything what I saw and ate here. The big bear, the tiger and the elegant mermaid or the shell fishes; everything was a work of an art and totally amazing. The food started with momos, nachos, corn and much more and then they brought in a box with skewers and inserted it in the hollow portion of the table. I enjoyed the hot and spicy BBQ kebabs and tikkas too from the skewers. Next were the main course which were for self service and so I took a lot of portions of everything; like the noodles and Thai curry and Kurkuri Bhindi. The desserts were the last but the best, the pastries were a little dry but the mouse and gulab jamun and the Paan Ice cream were absolutely great. It was a fulfilling trip out here.",Rated 5.0,7,72,??
Saurabh Tyagi,"Rated Pathetic Pathetic Pathetic ! Our ordeal started right at the complimentary Valet Parking. The guys were just not responsive at all. To my utter shock, the valet driver asked me ""Sir isme gear kaise shift karte hain ?"" It was an automatic gear car. We were duped by the fancy pictures of the interiors they have posted on the internet. When we entered, it felt like we were in some dingy prison cell. The quality of the interiors was ultra poor quality. Their experiment to start a concept restaurant has failed miserably. The ""jungle"" theme had artificial grass on the floor and a couple of thermocoal made bears and girraffes. The aqua theme was again poorly designed. Putting blue lights and a couple of fish tanks does not make it look too god. The service was damn slow. It took them 30 mins to get our drinks. Starters were coming in so slow, that we just didn't feel like eating. The quality of the starters was average. One thing that attracted us to the place was a kids play area. When my kids checked out the place, they were like Papa please get us out of here NOW. A small room with a tub and some colored plastic balls. No supervisors to look after the kids. Coming to the quality of food. The food was just about average. Chicken Biryani sucked big time. I would absolutely warn everyone not to waste their bucks on this rather pathetic place. There are other restaurants like Barbeque Nation and Pirates of the Grill which offer much better value for money.",Rated 1.0,3,18,??

Sahil Pandey,"Rated We were hunting a good dining option in CP when this place was settled down finally with me and my partner as its menu looked quite enticing. Climbing up the stairs to reach the main place was a tiring one but once entered, got marveled up with the whole setting. The big bear especially was cute and so do the tiger and the other adorable stuff a little further inside the area. The main part was the food which was just superb. From the Starters to the main course, everything was tasty. We didnt find the place expensive also. To sum up, I would say that it is a nice place that deserves a visit for sure.",Rated 4.5,17,60,??
Lovelish Arora,"Rated It was wife's team lunch (with family) and they decided to try this and that's how I ended up there again with no expectations and they clearly lived upto it. The 7 course meal is merely an eyewash, you'll never know when the so called 3 or 4 courses are over, in Gurgaon outlet they used to serve everything on table but here the last 4 course are self service so you'll have to get them from the buffet. They have introduced grill on the table as well, am sure they are trying to attract customer who are used to this format. Ambience: as usual great - 4.5 Service : 3.5 staff was trying their level best but still the service was slow. Food -2.5 Only saving grace for them were Mini Raj kachori, Chicken dimsums and paan ice cream.

Thanks to it as we got to experience the most beautiful place, a designed one, here in CP. The beautiful dcor and interiors based on the theme concept looked wonderful. We were okay to pay the buffet price here as it was sort of a party for us. We enjoyed mostly all of the items that were served to us. I particularly loved the main course and desserts.

SaIf AhmEd LaRi,"Rated Having heard so highly about the franchise's older branch, we wanted to check this 7- course buffet- with the jungle theme badlyy! But to our utter disappointment, this buffet was nothing close to any good. To start with, the location is a bit annoying as you will have to search for it for long and when you finally find the place, you expect it to be great but again, it disappoints because their so-called ""jungle theme"" & ""aquatic theme"" is very kiddish to be blunt.Now, we talk about the business i.e, food. The offerings in the buffet feel to be a quite limited respite of being boasted of a 7-course meal. To my amusement, they did not have PRAWNS. Their starters were just Okay, regular chicken tandoor, with fishes which were good. After that, the main course was almost average to be precious. In the desserts, their pastries are the worst that I have had EVER! To my dismay, the only thing that I started to really enjoy was their ""PAN ICE CREAM"" but then, I observed that there was a strand of hair in it. Which hit the nail in the coffin.I hope that they improve the quality. Be aware guys, don't just go by the reputation in theirother branch. This one will make you regret.",Rated 3.0,56,249,??
Sagarika Ahuja,"Rated A fresh place that we visited recently for a group lunch. My office is in CP itself and this place caught my attention after it was mentioned by a colleague. Well I would deliberate on some it mind blowing features that we came across. The overwhelming ambience is its USP firstly. The settings and the interiors were done taking inspiration from Jungle and marine life. The food had both Buffet and Ala Carte but we chose up the former one. From the starters to main course up till the desserts, each and everything was cooked up rigorously well. The waiters were commendable in their profile. Also, I would say that in comparison to many buffet restaurants in CP, this one stands out completely as they give a fulfilling meal in a very reasonable price and the terrific ambience is complementary.",Rated 5.0,4,47,??

We felt really pleased for visiting it out. The whole area was done up like a jungle on the entry and inside there was an ocean themed place as well with beautiful mermaid and sea shells. It was really an eclectic view. I would reserve the same view for the food as well. The Buffet menu had some really options to try around like the dimsums and skewer kebabs in the starters and the Thai Curry and Pasta (made on request).

This time it was the same restaurant but the location was different. It was CP this time and I visited it just with a friend. it looked ravishing with all the beautiful Jungle and Aquatic Settings. I chose out the aquatic seating this time and preferred the Veg Buffet. I must say that the Veg dishes were also commendable. They were served hot and fresh. Some remarkable ones were the Dimsums, kababs and the Thai curry.

The service at barbecue nation has always been great... While the service at JJ was slow and bad.... No one to start serving starters even after asked waiters to start serving.... Finally had to go and catch hold of the floor manager and ask him to get the starters started.... And almost everything that had to be repeated had to be asked for 2-3 times... Food in itself was ok.... Nothing great... Again the comparison I was doing was with barbecue nation... Which any days serves much better food .... Daughter found the paneer tikka to be very spicy and when I asked the guy to get less spicy... He got paneer cubes.... I mean really!! Main course was fine - breads too bad though... The only thing about it is the decor.... Different look and feel - The jungle look/ aqua theme... Went mainly for the decor which I thought kids will enjoy... And they surely liked it.... Overall....

Staff at the entry is courteous and takes care of you till the time they accompany you to the food jungle on the 1st floor. Ambiance does the justice to the name with false grass flooring and humming of birds to the nests. A little issue though was with outlay of air as that made the place suffocating as soon as Airconditioner was switched off. The food journey starts with Corns which were nice. Mutton Galauti kebab for me one the show though it never came back for a second round. With so much to offer in snacks which leads to the problem of buffet - You just can't have main course. But who cares after impressive journey ranging from chicken and fish tikka's to dimsums. From pizza to nachos. You name it they have it. I found service to be a notch slower or probably they were not accustomed for rush !! Desserts to lacked options. Though gulab jamun made my day.,Rated 4.0,152,349,??

The service is really very fast, they keep on serving you with starters without a pause. Rajkachori, paneer shashlik,grilled mushrooms,dimsums and honey chilli lotus stem are the best. The main course is even better, every single dish whether be it the chinese, japanese or north indian is mere perfect. The lasagne is really very nice, nicely cooked and with perfect flavours.

We went there in a bunch in a sunny Sunday afternoon but it doesnt have any open area as of now and but constructions are on here.

Rajata Surendranath,"Rated I came here with my colleagues for a lunch party and we were all on our cash respectively by the way. Getting a Buffet with 20+ items for a minimal amount of 600 approx is certainly not obvious. Though I must also say that starters I tasted were just okay but main course and desserts were tasty for me. Starting with the starters, I found the corn Chaat and the fruit salad good. The skewers dishes were also just about average. As far as the main course is concerned, frankly I loved the Bhindi and the Noodles the most, rest were satisfactory. The desserts were moist and tender the way they should be but nothing extraordinary. In between all the chattering, I actually didnt get the time to notice the ambience but it was good overall and so was the service.",Rated 4.0,5,62,??

Moreover, they have avery decent play area for kids also. But i feel they should seriosly take some serious effort in improving the food quality and service as well. When one is spending so much on food then the expectation also grows. However, I find this place with very average food quality and very less food options as well. At the same time they can improve with some attention towards food menu and improvement in service area.",Rated 2.5,1,0,??

Though the place is compact and smaller in comparison, still it has all the similar things to entice one; especially its food.

This one day while roaming around CP, this place caught my eyes and I was with a friend, we planned to dine up here only. The place definitely gained full points for the ambience from me. It is designed differently and that was a great experiment they have done. However, as concerning the food. I found that most of the items were done up nicely leaving the Corn tikkis and the kebabs. The Masala corn was tasty and in the main course which we had to serve ourselves had Noodles and Thai curry as some of the interesting dishes.

Well, I heard applauses and praises from a lot of my acquaintances for this place and all of them surely were correct. It was a spot on place with highly neat and clean ambience and mind blasting dcor. Diversified and richly decorated up interiors really matched up well with my chirpy mood. The waiters too were absolutely mannered and considerate. Food had enough varieties to make the appetite fulfilled. I would recommend the Non-veg one, as the meat had fresh flavors and the desserts astonishing.

When I got to know about the CP branch, got delighted and went there at the first opportunity I got up. Ambience is extraordinary just like its brother, the food quality has excelled a lot more, and location is excellent. I tried the Non-veg buffet over here and all the items were just superlative. In starters, the Nachos and Masala corns sealed the show, the fish tikkas on skewers were also a masterpiece. Main course: absolute delicious especially the butter chicken and chicken dimsums. Desserts were stupendous and the kiwi mousse and the strawberry mousse were the winners for me.

Since we were all empty stomached, we just had a blast trying out each and every dish of the Veg and Non Veg Buffets respectively.

To my great luck I found a table for four here without reservation just like I found it in the Gurgaon Branch as well. It is still in the process to get completed up and it doesnt have a skygarden section and it is all covered so there is no source of air as well. But it is just one thing; other things were all great from the food to the service. The BBQ dishes served on the skewers were hot and spicy, especially the Paneer Tikka and the Achari Mushrooms. With regard to the prices, this place is very much enticing and luring; within a grand you are getting such an amazing buffet with such a great seating area that no one would miss out on this attractive option!",Rated 4.5,17,46,??
Vishal Wadhwan,"Rated The starters were the tastiest (the mini Raj Kachori and the Fruit salad especially). The service was just about average though, maybe because it was overcrowded that time. The main course was yummy especially Kurkuri bhindi. The desserts were excellent, especially the Paan Ice cream.

Aishwarya Khanna,"Rated Jungle jamboree serves a 7 course buffet which distinguishes it from other buffet restaurants. Another thing that is different is its jungle themed ambience. As you enter the place, there are stairs lit with green lights that take you to the first floor. As you enter you see artificial grass on the floor, everything green and jungle themed and to accompany they plan sounds like that in jungle, chirping of birds. We had already made a reservation and I would recommend to make one as the whole place was full by the time we got seated. The buffet spread is wide and is specified on Zomato. I'd share the dishes we loved and ordered for again. From the first course, mini raj kachauri was delicious and they very well knew that people love it so they kept on offering again and again. The second course is placed with the main course. Galouti(veg and non-veg) and machli ka tikka was amazing. Chicken dimsums, fish fingers should definitely be tried. The starters are so full of taste and nicely made that they fill up your stomach and so we didn't try much from the main course. Pasta was average and we didn't really like the pizza so would recommend to try one and then order further. Among main course, I liked biryani. It had the perfect taste it should. I ordered for virgin mojito and liked that one over the others. Iced lemon tea is also nice. Desserts being my favourite I liked the seventh main course but expected a bit more. Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce was my favourite. I wish they had brownies too but they don't. The pan flavoured ice cream is a must try. The pastries weren't the best they were a little soggy. But the overall experience was a nice one and would definitely fill up your stomachs till the top.",Rated 4.0,15,445,??

It was a totally an amazing place and I totally trusted it as I already had gone to its Gurgaon Branch also and there too I had an amazing Buffet experience.

Padam Singh,"Rated Had the buffet menu, seven course meal. The starters are nice, veg and non vegetarian included. The drinks are also good. The sauces along the food are good, except they are served in tube like containers which can only hold about two table spoons. The ambience, wait, let's call it the decor is done in a way in which it serves justice to the name of the restaurant. The waiting staff was doing an average job. Main course was an assortment of common non vegetarian and vegetarian dishes, but all were good. The real bummer was the desserts. Only saving grace was probably the paan ice cream.

You will literally plead to the waiters to stop serving the food to you like I did!! But whatever it may be, the waiters were cordial in serving every dish and never hesitated or got irritated answering any of our queries regarding the place. I liked mostly all the items out of my Buffet but some of them still hinges to my memories like the Red Curry, the bhindi, the Skewers kebabs, the noodles and the mousses. The other beautiful feature of this place is its ambience which requires your good amount of time to observe it and appreciate simultaneously. The green and blue lights are the only ones which you will see out here but they could have brightened them up a little, so that it had become more adorable to enjoy everything quite clearly.

My toddler and his gang of friends had a gala time staring up at the huge aquarium set up in the Aqua themed area!

We enjoyed almost all of the dishes and each one of them was super. Like the Raj Kachori was small but tasty definitely. The Red Thai Curry in the main course was also quite spectacular.

Jatin Dev,"Rated #overstaffed with managers and under staffed with servers# I had mixed feelings about this place based on its reviews but the Saturday night buffet experience was a contrasting one. And twas not based on the sight of a grisly bear watching my plate. I am used to guzzling down dish after dish in a buffet so I would agree that the speed of service was quite slow but courteous nonetheless. Quality of food - chicken, fish, lasagna, lotus stem, fish steak, biryani were all pretty near perfect barring the cold bucket of crispy corn. And did I mention, that the dim-sums were strikingly delicious. The portions are small and you will have to demand your respective entree'. You may be bothered by people clicking more photos of the place than themselves. But the strikingly different ambiance and very well diversified menu make a good case to come back to this place.",Rated 4.0,53,152,??
Nikita Bhalla,"Rated This barbeque place is a good one from the outset but a drab one once you're inside, especially once you encounter their cheap ways of cutting down on the cost. So instead of honey chilli potatoes, they serve you bland honey (so called chilli) lotus plant. Or when they serve you the welcome drinks in glasses that are tinier-than-your worst imagination. The rest of the buffet was just about the usual. Three items that stood out for me were--Butter Chicken, Chicken Momos, and Paan Ice Cream. The ambience however is different. Going by a jungle theme, yout may want to give them some credit... The service was slow and draggy... It was a bachelorette and that could be a big reason for all of us having a good time amongst ourselves, sidelining the food bit a lil. But you guys need to buck up, if you want to pull crowds!!!",Rated 3.0,141,585,??
Samira Sachdeva,Rated This is one restaurant that I loved really from the start to the end. The restaurant was beautifully designed up and very stylishly done. The staff was extremely cordial and friendly. The chef also visited our table once to reassure if everything is warm and comfy. We loved the starters and took the dimsum serving twice. The skewers presented on the table were good too but the achari mushroom tasted just average for me. The main course was also yummy especially the Red and white Thai curry. Highly Recommended!!!!,Rated 4.0,3,53,??
Vikram Rajput,"Rated I believe this restaurant just advances in many features that are missing in the usual ones. The great jungle like decorations, the Aqua area and the sky garden one which is a semi-open area, and I am talking about the Jungle Jamboree located in the Gurgaon that I visited a month ago and now when I got aware about its opening in CP, I was on my toes to visit it asap. Only the sky garden area is missing out here, otherwise, both the jungle and aquatic theme based area are there and they are equally eye catching like the Gurgaon one. It is all green and blue and colorful. The best part about this restaurant is that you can have as much starter, main course, sweet dish, ice cream fruit as you could but you should know the art to balance them as then only you would be able to enjoy each and everything. The Starters that had Nachos, Raj Kachori, Fruit Chaat and Masala Corn were superb. The skewers dishes were equally lip smacking delicious. In the main course, the Thai curry and the dum aloo were stupendous. The Hakka noodles were also amazing. The fruit salad, ice cream and pastries too were just mesmerizing. The restaurant is pocket-friendly as well as I ate so much of food which I havent had at any other place as of now. So I would recommend this restaurant and both the branches are equally fantastic and ultimate and you can choose for yourself as per your convenience.",Rated 4.5,15,309,??

Raj Kachori is the highlight and tandoori snacks seems to be their specialisation. In Desserts, I can't name anything that I couldn't find on plate. Paan Ice-cream would complete the meal in the most amazing manner. The only thing that I would suggest is the size of the complementary drink served should be regular one. It was too small.

So very neat and clean that I started wondering how come I skipped such an amazing place until now! We settled in the jungle area and behind us there was a wide protruding white tiger statue stuck on the wall. It was a just so very beautiful. The buffet was right in front of us but first we started off with the starters. The waiter didnt take any extra second in the delivery and served the amazing items like nachos, dimsums, masala corns, tikki etc, back to back. I just enjoyed along. I enjoyed the main course with the similar zest and fun. The Thai curry was the most prominent for me. The Mojito along was just par yummy. I enjoyed the Noodles and the pasta too! So ultimately it was just a whole meal and I didnt find any shortcoming in anything. I would like to make special mention the Paan Ice Cream which is quite exclusive to this place and I have never tasted it before anywhere, the rest of the desserts were just okay though.

Alka Shah,Rated Jungle Jamboree is the best place for those who are searching for a restaurant that has a buffet at sound prices and equally enjoyable environment. This is one of premium places to be visited if you go by my word. I came here with my family and most of time; we just kept on admiring the beautiful interiors of the place. We were 3 people in total so we chose the buffet spread for ourselves. I liked the desserts the most out of all the items. The starters and main course items were also good but not that extraordinary. Only the Thai curry and Nachos caught my attention.

This place also doesnt disappoint from any part and comes out as an exact and extensive copy of its counterpart. It is also decorated the same way with the jungle and aqua areas and the interiors and decors out here are worth getting your attention. I tried out the Veg Buffet out here and everything was almost the same like I had in Gurgaon and I felt it was even better. The staff was very friendly and personal.

I planned for a visit here the next day only. The restaurant is quite similar with all the dcor and everything and there are just two areas which are in function right now. I chose the aquatic area since I love everything blue and my friend too liked the all over settings out here. We went for the Ala Carte over here since I already had the buffet earlier. So we had ordered for the Chinese this time, the noodles were tasty and sufficient in the consistency part and the Manchurian was aptly cooked and was just super yummy. Later the black forest pastries for both of us really made our dinner blissful.

Since it was my first visit here, I was a bit in anticipation and so got a friend along but it was just for some time only as I was overwhelmed after entering its gates. The aura over here is cozier and more fun and also the decorations are quite different from the Gurgaon one. Also as far as the staff is concerned, they were extra friendly and they really helped and guided us with all the menu part. So I decided to go for the N0n-veg buffet this time, since I had veg buffets earlier. Everything was fantastic I would say, from the starters up till the desserts. The main course in particular was the yummiest (chicken Biryani, chicken lasagna and Butter chicken). Also the Chef turned to our table as well to receive a feedback and asked whether we are comfortable with everything or not, which was a sweet gesture that I liked a lot. He even suggested many other items to try out which we will do certainly on our next visit.

We were all non-veg less except my mum so she ordered from the Ala Carte for herself. We gorged on the food certainly out of limit. The Starters and appetizers especially were succulent. The Chicken Salad and the Chilly Garlic Fish deserves special mention from me. Quantity wise also it was unerring.

Akshay Dhanwani,"Rated To one of the most brilliant food outlets in Central Delhi! Jumgle Jumboree is a fine place which runs on the same buffet concept as BBQ Nation and IGC. But what I must mention is the jungle theme that lifts up your mood completely as you put your first foot inside the area. The light jungle sound keeps playing in the backdrop as the place is well set with artificial grass and green lighting. Took a buffet on a weekday afternoon and we were offered the 7 course meal menu . Now there was such a wide variety that we were literally confused what to eat and what to skip. The food was brilliant; I shall let you do some work by checking their menu through the Menu section on this website. Talking about the taste, the food was undoubtedly delicious. The main course meal was also set up well and again, with endless options in both, veg and non veg department. However, the outlet needs to work upon their service speed and overall Customer-Manager relationship. This is something I found missing while I was comparing them to their contemporaries because when you're up for a great feast, you expect quick table service and manager coming personally asking about the quality of food and service. This DOES NOT MEAN the food was served cold at any given point of time. They definitely know how to maintain the quality but only if they could work a little upon the service sector. Would definitely suggest this place to other food lovers. Keep up the brilliant work.",Rated 4.5,17,174,??
Tanu Sood,"Rated I had come to Jungle Jamboree recently. I really liked there theme based interiors. The mixture of green in the Jungle Area and Blue in the Aquatic area was really done accurately. Limitless buffet. Starters were amazing, main course was amazing, dessert was the most amazing. The service was a bit slow in proportion to the speed with which we were eating our food. Also I felt that the prices were a bit on the higher side for regular visits. Other than these two issues, the place is great to visit especially for birthdays and special occasions since you are presented with a cake as well then.",Rated 4.5,2,33,??
Sankalp Sharma,"Rated Every since Jungle Jumboree opened its outlet in CP, it was on my wish list. A forest themed style restaurant with an amazing 7 Course buffet. The so called adventure starts as soon as you enter the place. The servers dressed up , the walls with 3D graphics the green carpeting on the floor the artificial plants on the ceiling. Each and everything is carefully picked to give the feel of a jungle environment. Even the music played is as such , occasional lion roars do seem to push it one step further. The ambience was done very well but it fails to make a person want to sit here for hours. We went there on a weekday so the restaurant was empty when we arrived. Word of caution always book a table here and dont be late, they dont really hold your seat after your Expected Tie of arrival! Anyways coming to the food , the lavish buffet started with the grill being placed on our table and first course presented which included Mini Raj Kachouri: Truly delectable and the restaurant is aware of it so they offer it again and again. Fruit Chaat , Nachos with salsa and Masala corn were nothing special , just average stuff. Second Course is actually Self service Salad bar station including Chicken Monchow: The soup is decent enough it pairs well with the Chicken Tikka Chaat which is amazing , even the Roasted Chicken Salad is amazing. By this time our third course arrived on the table.3 things stood out from the usual. Ajwaini Machili ka Tikka : This was just amazing 2 pieces served on a skewer , we grilled it nicely and it was actually the best Fish tikka I ever had. Gosht ki Galuti : The mutton galuti threw me back to the streets of chandani chowk and karims. It was so amazing that we couldnt get enough of it even after three servings. Murg tikka : Succulent pieces of chicken perfectly marinated in the right amount of masalas. Delectable for sure. By this time I noticed one thing that we werent given items from the Vegetarian menu which was slightly odd. I wanted to try the Paneer Tikka Zafrani. Our Fouth course was International starters Chicken Wings and Chicken Dimsums were decent, nothing good about that. The pizza on the other hand was pathetic, like it actually killed the mood. They should definitely work on the pizza. To the rescue came the Salsa Potatoes and The Honey Chilli Lotus Stem which actually were delicious. After this is was relaxation time before starting with the main course. Butter Chicken : Huge pieces of chicken in an amazing gravy , a must try. Rogan Josh : it didnt live upto its expectations the mutton was overcooked and the gravy didnt appeal much. At this point I tried Paneer Methi : It was actually delectable , even after the chicken and other stuff I really liked the Paneer Methi. The Grilled fish in Cream sauce wasnt good as well, the fish too buttery for my taste and after the fish tikka I really didnt like this preparation of Fish. The chicken Lasagna was very good a must try! The dal makhini and others were all just average. Coming to the Last Dessert Section, The Kiwi Mousse was the only thing that was amazing; rest all the desserts were a bust. The pastry was dry , moong dal halwa and rest was just average. Overall this was a wonderful experience but out of all the Buffet places and theme restaurant , it isnt on the very top of my list. A onetime try!",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Nishant Agrawal,"Rated I and one of my friend are buffet freaks and we usually go together and try different buffet places in Delhi/NCR. Jungle Jamboree is a known name and we decided to try it after seeing the ""7 course buffet"" menu on zomato. It is recently setup in CP with already having a branch in Grugaon since long. The ambience gives you a feel of Jungle right from the moment you enter here. The grass sofa was really unique. So, we took our table and the ride of this 7 course buffet started. Everything that was mentioned in the massive menu was available and appetizing. Among the starters you can't afford to miss the dimsums. It was the best I had so far. Unlike other buffet places the ""MAIN COURSE"" is just exceptional and ""DON'T MISS IT ALL"". Deserts were not bad but not the best either. The only thing that prevented me to give it 5 out of 5 is the service. Though the staffs were courteous but they always seemed to be struggling. The manager at the end came to us for the feedback and but was not quite interested in listening to the drawbacks shared by us. The quality and taste of food compensated every lacking thing here but the management really needs some improvement.",Rated 4.0,97,75,??

Ekam,"Rated So after so much wait I finally got the time to visit this place that people are going banana's over these days.. I opted to go for veg buffet which started of with fruits on skewer sticks along with mini raj kachori and corn chat.. All of the three things tasted good especially the mini raj kachori. After this the offering of veg galouti kebab with the usual paneer's , mushrooms and soya chaps on the grill were served. Galouti kebab tasted very good along with the chaps and paneer. Chaps were prepared using mustard oil which was a surprise though it tasted fine. I wanted to have a taste of there pasta so I asked to server for it which is on demand and takes like 20 mins to get prepared and served. It was very cheese with low on flavour probably can pass on this. To the main course and the stand out dish is dal makhani rest all are fillers though a special mention of lasagne is a must lasagne tasted like it should it did what pasta wasn't able to do. Dessert section was a bit of a let down the variety on offered was very limited. However , whatever was on offer was good. Recommendation - Virgin Mojito it was divine...

EMPTY STOMACH,"Rated It is simply one of the best and amazing buffet in Delhi. This is a perfect place to try something new and spend some quality time with your loved one because of its skilled chefs and pleasant (bit childish) ambiance. Visited this place on a weekday and it was quite empty. Staff was very welcoming although took a lot of time to set our table but once the ride of amazing food was started there weren't any brakes in it. In no time we were served 11 dishes and to my surprise all of them were worth a try (unlike most of buffet place) They almost served every possible dish in its starter and will fill your stomach so much that you may think about skipping the main course and directly jumping to desserts BUT FRIENDS DONT DARE TO COMMIT THAT SIN BECAUSE unlike most of the buffet place the best part of jungle jamboree is its main course ( healthy and yummy). They serve hell lot of dishes in their main course from lasagna to sarso ka saag , they have it all. Everything in their main course is delicious and worth trying. To make it simple there are enough Reasons to try this place Serves delicious food at reasonable prices Comfortable sitting which provides personal space Vast menu Jungle theme ambiance This place has swings for kids so that their parents can enjoy food in peace An advice to management - You people have a vast buffet menu and that too at such a reasonable prices but please try to improve the flavors of your starters both veg and non veg.

Just to tell only ambience is jungle, the waiters, the names of dishes are usual nothing to do with the theme. At present they have two dining options - A la carte and Buffet. Buffet is on 1st floor while A la carte is on 2nd floor. We tried A la carte. The food was good. One of the best drums of heaven I had. It is advisable to make a booking in advance specially when dining on a weekend evening. They also have a play area for kids.

There was good variety of main course from noodles to dal makhani to creamed fish... Had good variety of sweet diskes...two types of ice creames, gulab jamuns, pastries etc.. All the food was great.

I went to Gurgaon on a Recommendation and returned content and this time I took a friend here and he too had the similar fun and got entertained the same way. The Aquatic themed area seemed more interesting to me with all the real fishes so we dined up there only and ordered for buffets respectively, both veg and Non veg one were equally magnanimous and its USP was the unlimited amounts they were being served in.

Isha Saxena,"Rated After major success in Gurgaon - Jungle Jamboree opened their outlet in Connaught Place recently. The mammoth outlet is spread over three floors - the first floor offers the seven course buffet, the second floor offers the a la carte menu and the third is a lounge. The place is as authentic as it gets - divided into two parts - Jungle and Aqua - they place is designed perfectly to the last detail. Grass lined couches, shrubs on the walls and calls of animals playing in the background. The Aqua theme is essentially, well, blue with dolphins ranging the walls and tiny water fall fixtures. The dance is simple - you choose whether you want a vegetarian or non-vegetarian meal and the food starts pouring in. It was obviously a non vegetarian meal in our case. Starting with fruit chaat, nachos, masala corn and mini raj kachauris - you absolutely cannot miss the rajkachauris - they pop into your mouth into a thousand flavours -yumm! Among the appetizers - galauti kebab with a mini ulte tawe ka paratha is definitely worth a mention - even though, the flavour of spices was overpowering the tender taste of the meat, it was delectable. The lotus steam honey crunch was another brilliant whip up - supercrispy, drizzled generously with honey - the lotus stem was prepared very tastefully. Among the tikkas - the fish tikka was exceptional and we took numerous helpings of the same. The salad bar was lavish - the chicken tikka chaat was a very unique and toothsome preparation. Coming to the main course - the spread was extra-ordinary. The non vegetarian delicacies included Handi Gosht, Butter chicken, Grilled fish in thyme sauce, Chilly chicken, Chicken Lasagna and Chicken biryani. The butter chicken was delectable and stood out as a clear winner. Among the vegetarian options, methi malai paneer was very alluring. Desserts are the best things of every buffet. The kiwi mousse is not to be missed - otherwise the desserts were slightly disappointing. The pastries were slightly dry and could have been prepared in a much better manner.

I dont advice anyone to visit this resturant , visit only of u want to make fool of yourself becoz there are many other resturants in the city to spend well and enjoy. I rate this resturant as zero .. a big zero becoz everything was poor wether it was ambience , food , service ,quantity , location . I hav the actual pics of the bowl the are using to cheat the customers . See them and decide urself.",Rated 1.0,1,2,??
Anuj Aggarwal,"Rated Was Planning to Visit this New place in CP since its Inaugration but happen to visit it This Tuesday 08/12/15 With a couple of my Friends. First a Fall, Very Much impressed with the Resteraunt idea of a Theme based Dining. It has Two themes namely Jungle and Aqua which differs from each other completely. The Decor was preety good and unique. Coming onto food we chose to Go for their 7 Course Buffet. I really Did appreciate their Idea of Introducing some new dishes to the Regular North Indian All-You-Can-Eat Menu as served by the competitors. My personal Favourite in the Additions would be their Mini Raj Kachori.. It was a Delight to have.. In Simple terms it was like a Gol gappa Filled with dahi and Other Awesome Ingredients. Must Try !! Almost Everything in Starters was Good Although I averted from Their Soya Chaap since it was having a lot of Mustard Flavour. Freshly Made pizza was good To. One More suggestion is to work a bit more on Nachos as i guess It lacked a bit of Seasoning. After a multiple serving of the Delicious course of Starters, We hardly had any apprtite of the Main Course but the aroma of it made some appetite. Their Dal Makhni and Dal Tadka Is absolutely Lip Smaching. The way it should be.. creamy .. spicy and what not. Veg. Biryani was delicious too!! Few Suggestions .. More Vareity in terms of bread should be offered. On Demand pasta was an option in main course and We decided to go for it. the manager told us that it would take approx 20 mins. I guess This should not be the scenario if it's a Dinner Service time in a resteraunt serving Buffet.. Evrrything must be prompt. Desserts were good And I really Liked their Gulab Jamuns, Kiwi Mouse and Truffle Pastry. But There was Some Problem with the Moong dal Halwa.. Its texture was a bit off Beat. In total I'll give full marks to Service. It was Way better than one expects. Also the management was listening to all our comments with compassion. I met The Resteraunt's Corporate Chef Mr. Mathur and They did take the Suggestions positively and Also told us the probable reason for Same. Kudos to Him for that. In all A Total value for Money and Bang on on its dedication for Food. Some Changes Here and There and it will surely knock the Competition out of market.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Abhishek Rawat,"Rated Anjali Singh The seven course buffet does excite every foodie. Jungle really meets all expectation. Ambience has its say but if you are planning to capture your stay the green area is where you can take a table and click snaps. Beginning with starters Mini Raj kachori is truly well made, dimsum are light yet tasty, pizza and salsa pataoes are worth trying. On the other hand soya malai chaap and mushroom can be improved upon. After going through variety of starters in first 5 course, the maine course lacks options. Yes its true that one would be having much appetite left for it but it needs to spread over popular dishes. Deserts has a perfect blend of all sweets and nothing to complain about. Overall Jungle Jamboree is a must visit and value for money dinning.",Rated 4.0,5,2,??

Yesterday my friend told me that Jungle jamboree new outlet open at Cannaught Place, we are very exited and planned to celebrate our friend birthday there. we made a booking yesterday and we got confirmation message. we are very excited since we heard a lot about this restaurant. we reached on time at our confirmation were 2:15, first they tell me to wait 10 minutes for table. after 15 minutes they said our table were ready. when we enter the restaurant from narrow stairs, they provide us a small two people waiting table for 4 person without table barbeque. when we told to change the table they said they are packed and they don't have and staff were very rude. i called him 3-4 time but no one came. after all we came out and told whole story to manager at the reception and they told wait 10 minutes and they will provide proper table. but after 30 minutes no one came and we just waited. and lastly we we approached restaurant manager for all about this. we surprised to see that he doesn't even want to listen. he was just very rude and unprofessional.

Well, I chose the buffet option, the veg one for myself and all the others chose buffets only, veg and non-veg as per their interests. The food was very superb - especially the desserts (the black forest pastry and the Pan ice cream were luscious). The ambience was the highlight of the place. Though it was a bit overdone I felt like almost all of the interiors and everything was done in the jungle and aquatic way. The waiters were extremely courteous and went great lengths to make me feel content with the gorgeous food. They continuously asked if everything was fine or not and I quite liked that extra effort they were taking. Since it was a birthday, they celebrated the birthday with us and offered a birthday cake as well that really made my friend a lot happier. Overall, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend. However, a costly place it would seem at first but it equally balances the thing with its amazing and unlimited food part.",Rated 4.5,19,265,??

I had come here with my best friend and we were expecting a lot from it and it lived up to many of our demands really. It was an awesome lunch and almost everything was tasty. The starters like the Raj Kachori, and Masala corns were delicious but really not very much in the quantity part, the kurkuri Bhindi and the Dum Aloo were spot on. The strawberry mousse out of the dessert part was a highlight for me. And what to say about the ambience part, all of it was like a jungle and an aqua cave. Totally a work of art I must say.

Kamal Tripathi,"Rated I and my wife visited this restaurant yesterday and we opted for 7 course meal. Suggest book the table in advance as you will have a wait for a reasonable time. Here is my feedback Ambience: Ambience was nice. Something different for a change. Definitely something a family would appreciate. Service: Service was nice and fast. They were frequently enquiring with us about what we need and providing the same. Food: This was a bit disappointing part. We went for veg and non-veg options so I can talk about both sides of the story. Salads: 7/10, soup: 6/10. However barbecue was disappointing, it was cold so the entire assortment of starters was cold. If I compare it to BarbecueNation no where close. Main dish too was not tasty. For non-veg, in biryani chicken was not cooked properly. In desserts too, didn't like much any of the options. Payment options: Bill was roughly 2000. But they don't accept Amex cards. While they have their reasons but for such an establishment, this is a tad unreasonable.",Rated 2.5,1,0,??

Right from reception onwards we were greeted very courteously. We were provided with a very nice table in the corner side. Service was exceptional. Food was infinite, It just didnt stop coming. And what I loved the most was they presented the tikkas and kebabs dish on the skewers only and they remained hot and tender all the while due to that. So overall we enjoyed and gorged over unlimited food. Then the main course was also too amazing, the Thai Curry and the pizza in particular. And the desserts at last were the cherry on the cake.

The delicious dimsums followed by the chicken tikka and fish fingers. All of them were like 4.5/5. However there was one dish that became the highlight of my buffet, Galouti Kabab - I have never eaten a galouti kabab like that. It was 5/5. Salads were delicious too.

Amar Sirohi,"Rated When i got to know it has opened at CP, i couldn't resist myself from going here. I've heard a lot about it, mostly good things. So i had high expectations, and this place didn't disappoint. It is spread over large area on two floors. On first floor they have buffet and second floor offers a la carte choices. I ate veg buffet lunch which was modestly priced at 575 considering no of items they are offering. It is their signature 7 course meal. 3 courses they serve yu at your table, while rest 4 courses including main course yu gotta take yourself. My buffet started with mini raj kachori, masala corn, nachos with tomato salsa and mix fruit stick chaat. Gotta say LOVED THE MINI RAJ KACHAURI..ordered it countless times. Nachos and fruit chaat were good whlie masala corn was just okay..it could have been better. Then i had the kebab appetizers namely soya malai chaap, zafrani paneer tikka, tandoori sabji and cottage cheese shaslik with bbq sauce. Tandoori sabji had gobhi and mushroom, both of them were tasty. Zafrani paneer tikka was awesome. Malai soya chaap was not exactly malai soya chaap, it was a plain soya chaap and that was not up to the mark. Then i had honey chilli lotus stem which were delicious. Then there was SALSA POTATOES WHICH WERE TOO TASTY TOO DESCRIBE IN WORDS, SIMPLY HEAVENLY. Ordered them too countless times. Then there was this veg pizza which was utterly disgusting thin crust margarita. And honestly speaking it was tasteless. Then i had this fresh fruit florida salad, which too took my taste birds to another level. Up untill now i was super satisfied. Then i moved on to the main course and picked my two all time favourite dishes daal makhani and dum aalo along with bhindi kurkuri. All of them were lookin delicious, i ordered lacha parantha to accompany them and this is where my experience went from heaven down to earth. Lacha parantha arrived in like 10 minutes. Up untill them daal and sabji have become cold. And to my surprise none of the three dishes even sounded okay. I am a sucker for daal makhani and dum aaloo, i like them almost always no matter where i am eating but here..phew..daal makhani was tasteless..no spices at all. Dum aaloo were too disgusting as gravy was salty while aalo was tasteless. Bhindi kurkuri looked like fun but tastewise they were nothing, really nothing. Yu couldn't tell whether they were salty or sweet. Disgusted by that i now took veg lasgne and this was the worst lasagne i ever ate. Can't explain in words how bad it was. Now i moved on to the sweets corner. First i had moong daal halwa and gulabjamun. Both of them were tasty. Then i had pinapple, black forest and choclate truffle pastry. Them all were brilliant. Then i had this kiwi mousse and man oh man, it was so tasty i forgot all about the bad experience at main course. Ate a lot of it. And i finally i get a complimentary paan shot, which was the first tym i had something lyk that..loved it. Service was too, like the food part mind blowing part irritating. Most of the time service was blazing fast and assistant manager Vinnod Anjan was a big help and waiters all were too polite leave for that lacha parantha incident. Ambience..what can i say..it was amazing..everyone knows that. So overall most of their dishes were too good to be true and some were real bad. While the good part was overwhelmingly more than the bad part. I sat in the jungle themed area, next time i'm gonna sit in the aquarium side. Well forget the bad part, its a must visit place.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

And when I heard that its counterpart has been opened up in CP now, I couldnt control my happiness. I found the restaurant very easily and didnt have any problems with that. The place is decorative from the beginning of its entry only. The jungle like look dine-ins is somewhat similar with additional animals out here and the Aquatic area is even prettier with the trademark mermaid. They have kept on the separate kids area as well over here. The waiters over here also are quick and attentive and do fast delivery of the dishes. There were ongoing birthday parties which made the whole environment chirpier like the background music that played on. I was accompanied by a friend and we ordered for veg & non veg buffet respectively. They started with the starters and each of the items was a beauty the way it was presented and tasted the same way. All of it is just amazing. The main course too was amazing and ultimate but the main highlight of theirs is the desserts. I never get a chance to eat so many types of pastries and mousse at any other place and we were really enjoying every bit of our time here. Overall an awesome experience...they excelled in Gurgaon and are quite famous over there and here as well I am certain that they will do wonders with their absolute great food and amazing ambience.

Shubham Gupta,"Rated Having heard a lot about it on Zomato, thought of giving it a try since there are very few good options for Indian food. So went there with a lot of anticipation and expectations for a family dinner. There are 2 main options for the restaurant, the 1st floor is for its 7course meal and the 2nd floor for ala carte. We opted for the latter and was seated in a nice corner. The place as the name suggest is based on wild theme forests but it was more of pure greenery and nothing much exciting. Talking about the food, we ordered Manchow Soup and Sweet Corn soup, they both tasted fine. For the main course we ordered Paneer lababdar and Malai Kofta, both were decent enough to taste, but nothing extra ordinary. Now comes the main part of the restaurant. Their services is simply PATHETIC. They had to be reminded 4-5 times to get us the breads we ordered. The waitors were just passing the baton from one to another wrt orders. We had to literally ask for onion, water. They even have a special mocktail which is served in a pineapple skin but the base of the pine apple was not ut properly and the drink could not stand on its own and ultimately we had to get it in a normal glass.

But since it was a weekend it was hard for us to get a seat for ourselves. It was highly Jam-packed and we had to wait for a good 45 minutes time which was a letdown. Still it adds on to its popularity only, I believe and as we were seated, we again became cheerful. The service of the staff is excellent. The waiter instantly arrived at our table and guided us through the menu part and we ordered for the Veg Buffet Respectively. I was quite stunned by the fact that we can have whatever and in unlimited sum out of it and I couldnt wait to attack on my place. The starters were heavenly, especially the Masala corns, the small bucket they were being served was nicer. I personally loved the Shammi Kebabs out of the third course which were served on a mini Roti which was damn cute. The pasta salad was par yummy and so was the Kurkuri Bhindi which was served in the main course. Also, the Pizza which I had over here was so far one of the tastiest ones I have had up till now. The desserts options too were marvelous and lip smacking tasty, particularly the Kiwi Mousse and Pineapple Pastry. All in all, all the items deserve full marks. This place is a must visit one for those who loves to experience some adventure while dining up as the ambience over here will certainly transport you to a jungle, at least virtually.",Rated 4.5,18,298,??
Reena Rawat,"Rated I visited the place with my cousin and I was impressed by its ambience to the core. We ordered for the Veg and Non veg buffets respectively. The food was astounding in freshness, preparation and appearance. We had so much of food over here that reviewing anyone would be very hard but still I could recall the taste of the Raj Kachori, Red Thai Curry and Kiwi Mousse. Absolute luscious was the taste of everything and this particular thing only I remember until now. The Ambience and service were the best out here that I have experienced after a long time, especially its variety of themed areas were literally enticing. The rates are also balanced as they are serving loads and loads of food in less than a grand which makes it highly lucrative option for special occasions and celebrations.",Rated 5.0,13,78,??
Mini Sundriyal,"Rated It is best to be visited on a day when you feel like ultra-hungry and doesnt mind shelling out some extra few bucks. This restaurant has newly been opened here in CP as I have been told by a friend so I planned to try it out myself. It is an awesome place with all the jungle-like and aquatic-like decorations which were really scintillating. The food was equally palatable. The buffet had so many items to try upon (like mini Raj Kachoris, Chicken Dimsums, Butter Chicken, Paan Ice cream, Pastries, etc) that I couldnt concentrate on any one of it but it was all tasty and enjoyable. I had a great time over here.",Rated 4.0,3,41,??

Udit Sawhney,"Rated The good things first: 1. Ambience inside is tastefully done. Both sections - Jungle and Sea are good. 2. Food Quality is overall good. Snacks served on grill are nowhere compared to BBQ Nation. So less options, and taste also so average. Now, the bad: 1. Poorest service of a BBQ type restaurant. There was no proper attention given to us. 2. So called Managers there were in some attitude of their own. Do not know what made them think they can act like that. When i told before leaving the service was very slow, the only reaction was a smile. WOW! 3. Super slow service and total mis-coordination amongst the servers to manage a table. 4. Top of the thing was electricity on and off. Wow do you like to sit in a dark in a restaurant? the reason not being its ambience, but a fault in their electric circuits:) 5. I had asked for a small cake for a celebration, got a response we will check. On asking twice, i got it, but with a response from the server, i have requested hard to get it:)... Learn something here from BBQ Nation, apart from only copying their grill style and some menu items. I was fooled by other good feedback reviews, but you do not be one! Avoid this for sure!",Rated 2.0,8,26,??

We were promised a table in 15 min, but after waiting for 45 min, we were told it will take an hour more!! We were thus compromised a table in their ala carte restaurant.. extremely slow in serving snacks (decent snacks though!).. Had to ask 10 times for the complimentary drink that they promised!! Desserts finished once we were done with the main course.. overall a bad experience.. a place worth avoiding..",Rated 1.5,1,0,??
Nidhi Khanna,"Rated It is an amazing place for those who like to eat in bulk and doesnt get satisfied with anything less. This particular restaurant has so much in store for us that I literally felt that I ate almost the weeks food in a single day. The huge varieties of skewers dishes, the Chinese ones and the delectable desserts made me and my friend a fan of this restaurant. The food kept on coming to our table and only stopped when we told them to, otherwise they were so much insistent on feeding us continuously. It is an absolutely place which has done master work on the ambience. As the name goes, the whole place is covered with junglee decorations and also a separate division is turned into the Aquatic style where everything is blue from the lights to the sitting. Along with the buffet system, the separate Ala Carte menu is also equally attractive and I will try it out the next time for it absolutely. The staff of this place is highly attentive and never did any delay in the delivery in anything. Their energy was just that much apt which was required. They remained cheerful all through the time and I enjoyed their service equally as I enjoyed the yummy food. Also I saw a birthday party being held here over here and the waiters served the special complementary cake to the Birthday girl and sang the birthday song along. It is a perfect location for holding birthday parties I must say. . Therefore, for all the foodies out there, you can get a worthy experience over here and I am not done yet with just a single visit and will come again for stuffing the unlimited food again. Awesome place and great on value for money as well.",Rated 5.0,16,91,??
Vinay Rajput,"Rated I had an amazing time with this place and it felt like dining in a jungle. Such was the amazing dcor it had that included all kinds of creative jungle designs and stuff. I am fond of the buffet food a lot and doesnt get satisfied easily just with the regular dine-in places. So, when I came to know this place from a friend, I didnt do any delay in visiting it. The endless starters, in the vegetarian buffet tempted me to no end (most remarkable are the Raj Kachori, fruit salads, tikkas on skewers, and the dimsums). There were in accurate quantities and I had enough space left for the forthcoming main course as well. The main course too was equally delectable especially the Punjabi Dum Aloo, lasagna and Thai curry. The cutlery too was well decorated and stylish. The service was superb out here and the staff was giving extra attention on every table. Thus, if you are looking for a place which is high on design, serves abundant food and light on the pocket simultaneously, then this is the place you must visit. However, it would have been better over here if it had some alcohol options as well along with the scrumptious food.",Rated 4.0,3,33,??
Ragini Shah,"Rated Jungle Jamboree is a fantastic eating option great on VFM. The prices over here are all inclusive, wherein you get unlimited quantities of food in terms of starters, main course and desserts. When I had visited the place I was a lot excited as the place is designed in the form of jungle. There are statues of animals and creative paintings on the walls that soothe the eyes just perfectly. I had a lot of food over here and all of it was ultra delicious. From the nachos, skewers dishes, tangri kababs to the pastries, everything was mesmerizing. It was a sumptuous buffet. I felt content after I put the last bite of the pineapple pastry in my mouth. The assorted drinks course with the buffet was terrific too. The service is very prompt and quick to respond, the food consistency was amazing, everything was served in limited proportions and hence I enjoyed each and everything till the end.

Mayank Tyagi,"Rated I went to this place after reading a whole lot of reviews about it online. This is just the newly opened area and doesnt look short from any corner of it. It has the most amazing theme based decorations of aquatic and jungle styles. All is done with utter perfectionism. I exited my hotel where I was staying and it was just nearby located and I randomly entered this restaurant. I got a lot more from what I had expected and I was completely content while returning from the place. I would just summarize my whole experience in just few words though the actual experience was a lot more elaborate. - the service is quick and prompt; the items in the Veg buffet started arriving within seconds, - the food is unlimited out here, take whatever inside your buffet menu and in endless quantities till you are dead eating out!! - The food quality is of the topmost quality I perceived and the presentation too deserves full marks. - Absolutely everything was delicious Raj kachori, Nachos, Fruit Salads, Chaaps on skewers, Chinese main courses, Indian specialties, and desserts. - They've got an excellent seven drinks options as well that is available just at a nominal amount of 200 bucks, of which fresh lime soda and Aam Panna was the most amazing ones. - And to top it all, the background music of the chirping voices of the birds kept me engaged all through the time. I highly recommend this place to all the foodies out there as you dont get to have so much of food on a regular basis but for your special occasions and parties, it is a highly coveted and lucrative option.",Rated 5.0,2,66,??

Though one free suggestion I would like toconvey to everyone to try for the advance booking over here as the place remains jam packed all through the day and I am saying this out of my experience only. I went there twice before and left empty stomached from there but the third time reserved the table for the two us and then had great time over here. This place does stand out of the league. Such beautiful and unique dcor is hardly seen regularly and we had complete fun especially with the food over here. The succulent buffet over here is a must try and we ate all the dishes of ourrespective non-veg buffets vigorously. Everything was equally scrumptious and the most remarkable were the desserts like the pastries and the mousse. The Price is legitimate and affordable. Staff is very courteous.

Simmi Goel,"Rated I had gone to this restaurant with very high expectations as my cousin recommended it to me and also I believe since it has just opened up here, there was genuineness and sobriety in each and everything, whether it was the food, the service or even the prices. And I received a lot more extra from what I actually expected. Being served numerous amounts of food within the grand limit is not easy nowadays and this place does that bit with perfection. I simply loved all the items I was served, especially the Nachos, raj Kachori, Malai Soya Chaaps, the Skewer dishes, the main course, the Paan Ice cream, the Iced lemon Tea all were simply terrific. The restaurant is big and spacious and the decorations based on Jungle and Aquatic styles make the place a huge hit. Also the staff was super attentive.

Restaurant is on second floor and lift didn't work. My parents had to climb 2. Ordered chicken dimsums and I was served veg dimsums. When I complained the waiter didn't know what he served. Layer were replaced to chicken. Both were pathetic in taste 3 Ordered Mojito.. sugar was floating in the base 4. Main course: don't order chicken tikka masala..Chicken was not fresh After having these meals, my wife and kid wanted to leave and took the lift. And to utter surprise, when they pressed ground lift doors opened at a completely dingy place. She called me up and I immediately rushed down and to my surprise they were no where on ground floor where the lift doors opened. I told the security and called up the manager.

Such realistic types of jungle and Aqua themed interiors and I almost felt like dining in a jungle itself. In the Veg Buffet option that I took, the starters were served one by one and I tried all, of which the Fruit salad and the Masala Corn were the tastiest. There were dishes served over the skewers as well, in which the Zaffrani Paneer Tikkas were Luscious. The main course was equally fantastic, especially the Thai curry and bhindi. It has a separate Ala Carte section as well. I got to know after the visit that it has just opened up recently and by my records, I feel it will a lot far and be a huge success if the same standard is maintained throughout. The terrific service of the waiters is their highlight as they have well-mannered staff which made my experience unforgettable. A must visit place surely.",Rated 5.0,4,31,??

I ordered out their Non-Veg Buffet and my order started arriving and they were all amazing and delicious dishes. I simply loved the Chicken dimsums and enjoyed them the most and the chicken Biryani was just the ultimate one I have had after a long time seriously.

Rittu Paul,"Rated So here is a competition for Barbeque Nation. The food is amazing and the best part is that along with Indian it serves lot other cuisines. The fish finger is perfect, lemon chicken tikka is awesome, the galouti kabab melts in ur mouth and the cheesy lasagne is too good. And in the dessert section the pan ice-cream is full of flavour, which is smthing to look forward. Food quality is better than Barbeque Nation. But only thing this place needs to really work on is their service. It's extremely poor. Important thing to note is they are not even sry abt their poor service. It feels they doesn't care. There is a complementary drink which is not in the menu and they didn't even mention abt it, I saw it in zomato and enquired just before leaving and they say yes you can have as much as you can.

Prerak Giri,"Rated I went to CP with a friend to shop for clothes for myself and while returning, our stomachs literally pleaded to get fed down. It was in my mind that I have to vst Jungle Jamboree as I have already visited its Gurgaon branch and so I didnt have to think twice before entering the place. We were highly exhilarated as we observed the dcor of this place. Simply a work of amazing art. The mural paintings, the grass stitched chairs, the mermaid, simply everything was spot on beautiful. As far as the food is concerned, I went for the Veg Buffet option and my friend opted for the Non-veg Buffet. These people provides tons of dishes in a minimalistic amount that, at first it was hard for me to believe it. But it was true and herein the dishes that we enjoyed respectively. First course-The masala corns, the nachos, the mix fruits sticks chaat and mini Raj Kachori, we tried them all and we loved them all. Second Course-The Manchow Soup and the pasta Salad were the highlights for me and for my friend, the Chicken tikka Chaat was ultimate. He also liked the Roasted chicken salad a lot. Third Course-Among the items in it, I loved the Masala Soya Chaaps the most and fish tikkas were my friends favorite. Fourth Course-For me, the Veg Dimsums and for him, the Buffalo chicken wings were the main highlights of this course. I simply loved the Salsa potatoes also. Fifth Course & Sixth Course- With the arrival of main course, our hunger pangs already started resting down still I relished the Veg thai curry of the Global course the most and the Punjabi Dum aloo is also an excellent dish they serve. The butter Chicken and grilled fish were the dishes that made my friend completely ecstatic, he specially mentioned about some thyme sauce that he licked even from the palate. Seventh Course-The Paan Ice cream and the kiwi Mousse were the forerunners in the desserts category. The Chocolate Truffle pastry was also a lot tasty and extremely tender. The Drinks which occupies the seventh course place were equally exquisite and I need to do a special mention about the Aam Panna drink that gelled well with all the food I had. We had such an amazing time over here that I can go on writing way further as well but my main point is that this place is high on VFM. And the exquisite dishes they serve over here in such less amount is not seen, heard and available anywhere else plus their ambience and decorations are the icing on the cake.",Rated 5.0,16,91,??

The Indian course items were also very enjoyable especially the kurkuri bhindi. Among the dessert dishes, the most delectable items for us were the Paan Ice-Cream and Chocolate Truffle pastry.

I opted for their well-acclaimed Veg buffet and I felt ecstatic eating all the stuff it has. The masala corn, the skewer dishes and the soup were the most amazing items out of all I could still recall. I would like to mention specially their global main course. In it the Thai Red curry and Hakka Noodles were very well prepared and presented just perfectly and the taste was actually indescribable. Yes, it was that amazing.

After some talks they gave us bigger space but to hide there mistake they tried to fool us that we have reserved there Gurgaon one. Second thing, my grand ma is not able to climb stair and while booking we asked is there lift or not, for which they responded 'yes the lift is working' but it was not. After 20-25 min the lift started, which too doesn't worked first time. Thirdly the service was too too bad. In the names of moctails they served soda mixed with local syrups which were too very bad . The place was so suffocated due to which my sister fainted and from management we got no help. Due to malfunction of the lift we had to take her from stairs.

Delicious servings from all over the world not just the regular north Indian theme. They had momos pizza American corn to raj kachori ...yummy!!

Ankit Das,"Rated Jungle Jamboree Restaurant is doing a great deed by making that extra effort for entertaining us in a big way. I had known restaurants just for eating up to the fullest and paying attention to nothing else but in here when I had gone, I enjoyed the ambience as much as its delicious food. The first & Second floor of the restaurant which are in service right now and what an amazing jungle and aqua themed areas they have. Absolute creativity personified. The detailing of each and every part is done impeccably. I chose the Veg Buffet option since I didnt have the breakfast in the morning as well and I was ready to eat up each and everything available out here. The waiters were making that extra effort to make me as comfortable as possible. Below are the must try options one should definitely go for and for which I am surely gonna come again: I ate Mini Raj Kachauri , Nachos, Fruits & Masala corn in the first course, the Raj Kachori was excellent. In the Second Course, I skipped the soup & salad. I had thoroughly enjoyed the grills on my table. Well, frankly speaking I was already half full after this much so I headed straightaway to the main course and had Veg Lasagna, Hakka noodles & sauce. I was literally too filled up but kept eatinglol... Each and every bite of it seemed heavenly. Still some place was being reserved for the DESSERTS and they were all awesome. Yum is the word for it and fan is the word for me which I have become now of it. Well I feel that no restaurant in Delhi whosoever it is, has such an expansive menu and serves so much food in just a meagre amount. I loved my dining over here and returned exhilarated and fully satisfied with two big burps as well ;-",Rated 5.0,23,203,??
Mohan,"Rated I was in CP yesterday roaming and chilling out with friends that I got encountered with this restaurantwhich was looking intriguing from its faade so we planned to dine over here. This place is loaded with enormous amount of drawings and carvings over the walls which were actually giving a jungle feel to us. The restaurant is divided into two sections, the jungle area where we dined and the Aqua area which was all blue and beautiful, the mermaid statue in particular.There is a unique seven course buffet system out here but we chose for ourselves from the Ala Carte that day. We tried the Manchow and Chicken Sweet Corn Soups, Dry Chilly Chicken and Chicken Hakka Noodles, the sweet corn soup was rich on the flavors and the Chilly chicken was rightly spiced up and cooked really well. The noodles too were extremely delicious and the quantity of it was sufficient for two people. One of my friend ordered for soya Chaap Masala and Roomali Roti and they too were delicious. For the desserts, we had chocolate truffle and strawberry mousse. The truffle was loaded with awesome strawberry filling and we ordered the same again twice. Therefore, the food was gratifying for us and the next time I am coming here, I will try out the luscious looking 7- course buffet as well.",Rated 5.0,4,77,??

Karan Wahi,"Rated I visited here with my office team for a lunch. Went in for buffet , the food they serve is just amazing almost everything is just fingerlicious. My personal favourites- paan icecream, chicken lasagne, chicken wings and honey chilli lotus stem. These were a few dishes which just aroused my taste buds. The service on table for starters is too slow. We had to keep waiting on the table for the dish to arrive the food was great but with a lot of lag in serving",Rated 3.5,22,61,??
Sanju Aneja,"Rated They already have a successfully running restaurant at Sushant look, Gurgaon and here they have come up with the same concept in the heart of the city. The entry is a li'l cumbersome but once you enter the place, you will be blown away by its two different, brilliantly themed sections - a miniaturejungle on one side and a blue coloured aquatic scene on the other end. JUNGLE JAMBOREE offers a 6 course enormous veg & non veg meal in their buffet spread on the first floor and also gives an A-la-carte option on the second one. I went with the non veg option and was offered a great variety of dishes. From among them, am mentioning the ones that I enjoyed the most - 1. Soft textured GOSHT KI GALOUTI served over ulte tawe ka parantha 2. Perfectly grilled spicy CHICKEN SATAY 3. BUFFALO CHICKEN WINGS that had sweet nd spicy sauce over them 4. AJWAIYNI MACCHI KA TIKKA- the supple fish with ajwaiyni marination. And from the main course, 5. The sweet, tangy and spicy BUTTER CHICKEN 6. MUTTON ROGAN JOSH with a sumptuous gravy 7. Appropriately grilled BASA FISH in THYME CREAM SAUCE impressed me the most. In desserts - the MOONG DAL HALWA prepared in pure desi ghee and GULAB JAMUN were simply outstanding. While creamy textured PAN flavoured ICE CREAM took my heart away. It was a complete VFM buffet (non veg) at Rs. 675/- all inclusive. Their main course was better than snacks section as I found some minor flaws in their variety of snacks. Hope they will come over it soon. They have a kids play area as well, much to the relief of parents and shall be opening a bar on the third floor in the near future.",Rated 3.5,60,575,??
Abhilasha Aggarwal,"Rated Went there for a family celebration... It was just within a week of their opening of this new branch in Connaught Place... Had heard great reviews of their Sushant Lok branch so had gone with great expectations... N thankfully enough, they were well met with... A warm welcome by the staff.. followed by some complimentary mocktails... The kids just loved the play area... a full room with good quality toys for them made them go crazy and forget the food (tht was not nice..!!) but loved the thought of having a kids play area in the restaurant premises... we did not go for the buffet (served on 1st floor) and rather chose the a la carte which is served on second floor.. the steep flight of stairs was a lil bothersome but once you enter the place... it completely takes you over... Loved the green sofas... food was good too... just the right balance of taste n spices and of course.. a wonderful play of colours... My only complain.. portion sizes served are tooo small... if only that can be worked upon... Wonderful place to go for family dinners/lunches with young kids... All the best... Way to go...",Rated 4.0,23,20,??
Kavita Bajaj,"Rated I was really happy to know that Jungle Jamboree restaurant has now been opened in Connaught Place as well.I literally dragged my fiance to this place and we really had a great time. It is as beautiful as its Gurgaon branch.Well, as I was busy admiring the beauty my fiance finally insisted on having the food as well and I was super excited for that more than ever. We ordered from the Buffet system and I had the Veg one this time and he chose the non-veg option. They were served to us with extreme courteousness by the waiters and a permanent smile on their faces made me more cheerful. The Nachos with Tomato Salsa were yum. They were utter crispy. The Veg Manchow Soup was equally flavorsome. The Malai Soya Chaap, the paneer tikka , the mushroom stick served on Skewer were also a winner. Too many items to name them all but another item that deserves a special mention is the Veg Lasagna. There were too many things in the main course, so finally headed towards the desserts. Simply loved the scrumptious Kiwi Mousse, although Gulab Jamun & Moong Dal halwa were also delicious. That was the highlight of all the items.I loved it in Gurgaon and I love it here even more as it has become morecommutablefor me to come here every now and then and has come close to my heart ten times more. Wish jungle Jamboree continue to entertain foodies like me all the time with its splendid ambience and delectable food.",Rated 5.0,25,239,??
Meera Taneja,"Rated I was darn excited to have found this place at CP. I heard about it from a cousin who resides in Gurgaon, that it is a theme based restaurant and along with the terrific ambience, has some amazing buffet system as well. I didnt want to leave this precious opportunity of visiting it over here and surprisingly it was the day of its opening that I had come. I was accompanied with a friend and we were equally spellbound after seeing its first floor jungle like area and as we approached a little further a big bear welcomed us, it was looking so cute and real. The ceiling and flooring of it was looking like an original jungle and the painting on its wall had some mural statue appearance from which leaves were jutting out and it felt so peaceful looking at it. The most fantastic and unique thing I felt was with the chairs, they too were encased with some grass-like material and it was absolutely comfortable sitting on it. Well, coming to the most important part, the Food. We ordered for their stupendous 7-course buffet and the amazing course was served to us one by one with extreme courtesy. I especially loved their starter, the Raj Kachori and my friend liked the Masala Corn. But the Aam panna was a winner for me as I felt so much refreshed gulping it down after a leisurely meal. Amongst the other dishes, the Paneer Tikkas and veg Dimsums are a must try. The next time Ill come here which is sure shot thing, I am going to try their Aqua themed area as well and also I bless the place to have provided us such an entertaining experience.",Rated 5.0,21,259,??
Molisha Bhandari,Rated Went to jungle jamboree for a bday treat today..must say this is a great place to hang out with friends or family! Ambience: must give it a 9 on 10 for the immaculate feel of the jungle.. They even had animal noises to complete the feel.. Shall I say more :p Staff: really friendly and attentive staff.. Being newly opened they kept asking us if the food was fine .. That too after each course n there r 7 courses!! Immediately changed the virgin mojito which I didn't like! Drinks: this is their one n only fatal flaw.. The pink lady n aam paana were weirdly diluted and the virgin mojito hardly had a minty flavour. Wish they work on their drinks section :) Food: we had the lunch buffet.. The variety of food is mind boggling! 7 courses :p. the 1st course had nachos which I felt shd have had lesser oil but it was fine anyway; fruits; sweet corn in a bucket which was cute! The 2nd course had loads of barbequed stuff all of which was really tasty! Really loved the dimsums too. The main course was fine though obviously I didn't have much.. We were over loaded by then! The desserts were good especially the halwa! All in all a great experience at a great price especially in cp :) will surely visit again for the buffet !,Rated 4.0,1,0,??
Bala,"Rated Excellent Ambience, kids loved the place like anything. It was tough to hold them to the dining tables. They had two options, one like the jungle and the other like in the water surrounded by aquariums. The kids chose the aquarium side. The ambient light was blue here and was so pleasant. The food was good. The service was excellent. The staff were so nice. Wow they have valet parking as well.",Rated 4.5,4,1,??

Gurneet Kaur,"Rated I was here to try the food before the official opening. The restaurant has been converted into a jungle quite literally with a lot of attention paid to details. The couches and chairs also have a grass covering to give you the jungle feel. Interestingly, the background music also was birds chirping. Kids without a doubt will love this place. They serve a 7 course lunch and dinner and that's a lot of food! First course: We started our meal with mini raj kachoris and what a start! Fresh, just the right balance of chutneys. Loved it. Mix fruits sticks chaat was ordinary. Pass it! Nachos with salsa were good. Masala corn was impressive in terms of its presentation and taste. I asked for a second serving. Second course: I wasn't in the mood for salads so gave them a miss. Tried the only non-salad offering: veg manchow soup. Surprisingly delicious. I didn't expect JJ to have a soup this delicious. Impressed. Third course: This was all about the Indian Appetizers on skewers. Please try the malai soya chaap even if you are a non-vegetarian. It was literally melt in the mouth. I can still imagine the taste and freshness. Subz galouti and tandoori sabji were ordinary. Zafrani paneer tikka was delicious. Fourth course: Cottage cheese shaslik with bbq sauce was yummy. Do try it. Veg dimsums were nothing exciting. Veg pizza is on demand, do try it. It was one good pizza. Salsa potatoes were a disappointment. The honey chilli lotus stem is something I tried for the first time. Liked it. Fifth course: This was all about the Indian mains. Yellow dal was better than the dal Makhani. The dum aloo and karari bhindi were decent enough. Sixth course: This course left me asking for more. Only the Thai red curry was delicious, rest everything was a major disappointment. Seventh course: Moong dal halwa and pineapple pastry stood out amongst the rest. Gulab Jamun was delicious. Drinks: Aam panna and virgin mojito were good. But the cucumber based drink was outstanding. So fresh and refreshing. I having it till the very end. Excellent service with delicious food!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Saurabh Sethi,"Rated Tried many restaurants in CP as it's a hub of restaurants but Jungle Jamboree will definitely going to be a hit. Beautifully designed, spacious and good quality food. We had Chinese over there. We ordered crispy honey chilly potato, chicken momos, hakka noodles and diced chicken hongkong. Everything was really tempting. We enjoyed the food. Kids also enjoyed as they were playing in a separate play area over there. Its a must visit place.",Rated 5.0,4,2,??
Sidharth Sood,Rated Edit After the shocking turn of events that occurred on 4th feb 2016 I declare Jungle Jamboree completely crappy restaurant. Staff r clueless manager is so bloody arrogant food is worse and overall experience even worst..We don't need dis crap in our city go back to gurgaon Being The first Expert and Verified user to Review this places is exciting. ok so i've already been to their original outlet in Gurgaon ..the only thing i didnt like was the distance from Delhi. SO Delhi Deserved its own Jungle Jamboree and CP is undoubtedly the best place Jungle Jamboree here is an exact copy of its Gurgaon outlet but Copy with newer and better upgrades just like the Android system(The Ios user can sigh) SO it has two different ambiance of Jungle and of Aquarium. both are very good What stands out for them The 7 seven course - ofcourse Food is of utmost importance. but their service and hospitality With the market overflowing with a no. of Buffet restaurants all charging near the same amount Hospitality is what makes the difference here Ive been to almost all buffet restaurants and must say the hospitality here is as good as that at BBQ nation if not better The service is Quick and both the Chef and the Manager visited us and took our feedbacks The best thing about the food was the unlimited drinks of 7 types (but yea u have to pay rs 200 extra for them)All 7 were worth it specially The Paan shot and Aam Panna This restaurant will certainty give all others a run for their money A must visit place.,Rated 1.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Priya Ahuja,"Rated Went this restaurant yesterday. Really impressed with the ambience. It was a 3 floor restaurant & every floor was given a different look. We had opted for the buffet. The starters were really yum. The grill provision was there on the table so the starters were hot too. Chicken tikka, raj kachori, paneer tikka, malai soya chaap, salsa potatoes, honey chilli lotus stem etc etc were there in the starters so we had not moved to there main course section as already extra fill with there amazing starters. Will try the main course next time for sure. Do visit guys.",Rated 4.5,2,0,??
Akanksha Kodanya,"Rated Got to know from their Facebook ad that they are opening up in CP. Was really glad as I'm a big fan of their ambience & food. I've been to their Gurgaon branch a couple of times and have had a very good experience everytime. Ambiance is amazing, no match simply awesome. The Jungle & Aqua area is bigger this time. Very spacious and very beautiful. Starters are excellent. The Golgappas are too good, loved the corn chaat also in the first course. The chicken tikka was great , served on the grill it was piping hot and apt to taste. The pizza again was really yum. In the main course though all items are good but Lasagne and Kurkuri Bhindi are the must haves. Its good to see the taste consistency in both the places. Must go. Highly recommended!!",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Deeksha Saxena,"Rated We were strolling in CP this Sunday evening and we saw a huge bugs bunny standing right there in the outer circle. We went close to it and found that it's a new restaurant called Jungle Jamboree. We were a bunch of friends and when we got to know they serve buffet as well we had no reason to not go. We went to the first floor..snd wow what a lovely setup .the starting area is all jungle style and the second half is aquatic with beautiful blue colors on the wall. Prices are very nominal. Food options r too many. The raj kachori is the yummiest that I have had. Fish fingers were awesome. Pizza was super yum. Murg Makhni and biryani was too good. We made a right decision to visit the place. Got to know they have a branch in Gurgaon also, will go there as well soon.",Rated 5.0,20,21,??
Anchit Jain,"Rated We were invited by the Jungle Jamboree team for a special preview of their 7 course meal to give our feedback on the various aspects of our meal. Our first task was of locating this outlet. The address given to us was of P block, CP which is the same block where Monkey Bar, Sidewok, Sarvana Bhawan rest. Still it can be difficult to locate it as it completely gets disappeared behind a big tree. So here's the tip to find it. Its just located between Caffe 9 and Sidewok. This place is spread across 3 floors out of which only a part of it is operational other is under construction on completion of which I guess this outlet will get open. The ambience which is a jungle theme is quite appealing though at times it might look a bit kiddish. The servers dressed in a jungle warden attire started serving our first course. The choices on the menu were tremendous which gets almost doubled for the non vegetarians. Here is our review of the food: First course: 1. Mini Raj Kachauri - Haven't had a better raj Kachauri than this - 5/5 2. Mix fruit sticks Chaat - Nothing special and can be avoided with so many options around - 3/5 3. Nachos - Good but could've been better - 3/5 4. Masala corn - They need serious improvement - 2/5 Second course: It consisted of veg manchow soup and various salads which got ignored due to other interesting options. So I don't have much idea about this course. Third course: They put up a grill on our table just like barbeque nations and pirates of grill does. So some of our starters came on skewers and the others were served to us directly. 1. Zafrani Paneer Tikka (on skewers) - It was quite good and different as no other restaurant provides this on skewers - 5/5 2. Tandoori Sabz (on skewers) - Quite okay nothing special - 3/5 3. Subz Galouti - It was very nice with the galouti kebab being very very soft. Loved it! - 5/5 4. Malai Soya Chaap (on skewers) - It was disappointing. It needs some improvement - 3/5 Fourth Course: Fourth course was again the starters which were global this time. Though I felt this course could have been merged with the third course which were the Indian starters. This looked as if it was set up just to increase the number of courses. 1. Cottage cheese shaslik with BBQ sauce (on skewers) - Could have been better - 3/5 2. Veg Dimsums - They were green in color and quite nice - 4/5 3. Salsa Potatoes - Looked like a dish that straightly came out of the barbeque nation's kitchen - 4/5 4. Honey Chilli lotus stem - Was just okay - 3/6 5. Pizza - which had be served on demand but since it was a preview, it was served without us demanding that and it was a thin crust pizza and was just amazing! - 5/5 Fifth Course: Fourth course was succeeded by the main course which consisted of a variety of dishes which were set up as a buffet. We tried some of them: 1. Dal Makhani - Was pretty nice though I've had better than that - 4/5 2. Paneer Lababdar - It was quite okay but could have been better - 3/5 3. Punjabi Dum Aloo - Can be easily avoided - 2/5 These were accompanies by Lachha Paranthas which were very nice and decent in size to eat. We didn't taste their Gobhi Tamatar Adhraki, Kurkuri Bhindi and Sabz Biryani which were also a part of the buffet. Sixth Course: It was the global main course which again could have been merged with the fifth course. It wasn't much interesting. We only tasted the Veg Lasagne which was quite good and I'll rate that 4/5. Other than that there were Hakka Noodles, Veg Red Thai Curry, Pasta (which was available on demand), but we couldn't taste them. Seventh Course: Here comes the most disappointing course of our meal. There were 6-7 options in the desserts buffet which were said to be Veg. The pastries were also mentioned as veg but on confirming from the servers, they told us that they contain egg. So, the veg sign could literally misguide anyone. They must rectify the same quickly. . We had the following: 1. Gulab Jamuns - Regular stuff nothing extraordinary - 4/5 2. Paan Ice cream - Amazing! I loved it! - 5/5 Overall this course didn't appeal us much 7 course of drinks: There were paired 7 course drinks as well of which we just tasted their Aam Panna and Paan Shot which were quite nice. The service during our meal was very quick and the servers were very courteous which made our experience a lot better. They can be a serious threat to barbeque nations if they improve on some minor things mentioned above. Overall we truly enjoyed our visit here.
