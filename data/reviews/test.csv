Shikha, This sagar ratna is very old restaurant serving delicious dahi vada & scrumptious south Indian food. This place is loosing its charm due to poor service & dull ambiance. Average place to visit., 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Ashish Sarma," The sofas are torn... Not well maintained. We took one couch that looked OK.. But then were asked to vacate it since it was reserved - even though there was no sign placed on the table that indicated reservation. The waiter's attitude was below the standards of a supposedly good restaurant chain. The food is overpriced for the quality and quantity... There is a minimum standard of presentation that is expected but was not there. Overall an avoidable experience, specially the CP outlet... I have heard the other outlets are good and hence was hugely disappointed coming to this one.", 1.0,1,0,??
Toshi Vasistha," Visited this place recently, because many people referred. Biggest Disappointment. I just love South Indian Cuisines, but what they served was just pathetic. We ordered Mysore Masala Dosa, not at all crispy, served cold and the filling was bland. The Idlis were hard, served cold, the sambhar was more like rasam in terms of consistency , and coconut chutney was ridiculous. Only one item served was fine and that was Filter Coffee. Very bad place, bad food, slow service.", 1.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Jasmeet Singh," This outlet famous for its versatile southy food has always been my favourite stop for appetite. This tym, ordered mini idlies dipped in sambhar , schezwan noodles and masala tea. There are flavoured idlies as well but we ordered the plain ones. Their taste has always been nice and the staff always welcome the advises.", 3.5,38,75,??
Abilash Baskaran," One of those places that deserved to claim they serve multi cuisine. On my one day pit stop at NCR headed here for a quick dinner in CP. The company I had wanted some ""home food"" and this place sounded safe. The only similarity between Tamil and north Indian cuisine is that they both screw up the other cuisine big time. Don't trust me, try out some panneer tikki from a leading south Indian chain in south. The ambiance was good to seat a 70 people in the ground floor and another 50 in the first. Not great zeal over decors. They were simple and elegant, good lighting, efficient space management. This sure shows they are pro in what they deal with. Service was fast. Waiters know the food (obviously) and are good enough to suggest. Food- Masala dosa is good. You hear that from a Tamil guy, you go try that masala dosa. Sambar was a little off track, not sure where it exactly differed, edible. Chutnies were spot on. Rotis and subjis were decent. I had better ones in the dhabas of chandni chowk earlier that day, they stand no chance in comparing. Total damage for an averagely full meal for three persons was a 600 bucks change. For the south Indian food they serve, they can charge so much. PS- We did get some at home feel after that masala dosa anyways.", 4.0,83,416,??
Neha Singh," South Indian cuisine is one of the lightest food to eat on any day and is also one of my favorites . Whenever one thinks of eating good south Indian food only sarvanna bhavan and sagar ratna (close competitors) come to anyone's mind ; with the former being slightly better of the two in terms of authenticity. Sagar ratna has bit north.Indianised itself in its offerings and the tastes has been twisted accordingly to suit to the localites here . This outlet is located in block K in outer circle and is easy to access from metro station gate number 2/3 as well . Spaced over two floors , interiors are done subtly to depict the simplicity of South India. Wooden furniture , ample lyting , few painting on walls .... And the interiors are done . They offer not just south Indian food , but also north Indian and Chinese . So its a complete restra and not an exclusive south Indian one like sarvanna , with their speciality being south Indian ofcourse . I have visited this outlet quite a number of times now and have tried almost everything that this place has to offer . My personal favorites here are rava Masala dosa , Mysore dosa , filter coffee and dahi vada . On my last visit I tried their vegetable cheeze dosa in which dosa was Stuffed with lots of cheeze and capsicum , carrot etc . The taste was bit bland and it wasn't even going well with the chutneys and sambhar served and hence was a disappointment. It's not just south Indian food , their north Indian offerings are also good to taste . What stands out here for this place is Chinese combo - reasonable , spicy , flavorful and ample quantity ; this one is definitely worth the price . What I personally love about sagar ratna is that they keep introducing new types of dosas on monthly basis and keep improvising on their menu regularly . Recently they are celebrating podi fest and the offerings are really great and I will be visiting them soon to try them. Service is quick , staff is courteous and pricing is decent too . Worth a try !!", 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Akash Shah," Worst dining experience. Have tried Sagar ratna at other outlets and never expected such food. There was a huge waiting outside, was excited for the food but all in vain. Mysore masala dosa was as soft as roti and served cold. Podi idli was a disaster. Sambhar was as thick as rasam (and rasam was out of stock and I wonder why). Tried pesarattu mla dosa for the first time, now this actually tastes this why or just prepared badly as other items. Only well served items were madras idli fry, hot n crisp and sweet lime soda. I hope I just ended up here on a bad bad n food is not bad on other days. Needs a lot of improvement.", 2.0,43,126,??

Sachin Kumar, Disappointment of epic proportions. I frequently go sarvan bhawan for south Indian food but unfortunately I thought of trying out this place last night. There was some podi feast going on so we ordered podi idlis because the photo in the menu looked so delicious. But when the real idlis came the excitement was gone. They tasted nothing like what I had expected. The fried idlis where good. We ordered Mysore masala dosa and pessarattu dosa. Both were below mark. The sambhar was more like rasam in terms of consistency. Will never go there again., 1.5,16,67,??

PRAMOD," Sagar Ratna is a good name in Delhi NCR for their south Indian food items and north Indian food also....I was visiting first time to any sagar ratna restaurant.So I went to this outlet in C.P. with my 2 other friends who are from South India andhra Pradesh and I also have lived there in Andhra Pradesh for more than 8 years.So iam too much familiar with all the taste and items of South India.Biryani,idli,dosa,vada,upma,uttapam etc. So after we went there there was a huge rush as it was Saturday of October month and we waited more than half an hour for our number.Space is good 2 floors are there.We got seats in the top floor.And our order was as follows: Paneer,lemon rice,mixed raita,butter naan and papad.... Now coming to the waiting time after we order.The person who took the order told us that it will take more than 20 minutes to bring our food.So I asked him to give the papads first and you will not believe they took more than 20 minutes to deliver me papads...And food it came nearly after 40 minutes....So we were upset with the time they took for bringing us the food....coming to cleanliness they are maintaining it nicely but they must make the hand wash area big there as it is too much small in the top floor and it brings problem to all the people waiting for hand wash as there is space to stand for only 1 person who would be washing his/her hands.No other person can even stand up in that small place.... Lemon rice was above average.Naans were perfect and same was with mixed raita and paneer was also good..... So my verdict is that this SAGAR RATNA restaurant is not up to the verdict and name it has in other locations in Delhi NCR.....They must cooperate nicely with their customers as we asked them nearly 7-8 times how much time it will take for our food to come.....So please SAGAR RATNA management team.... Maintain your C.P. branch perfectly as you are maintaining it in other locations......", 3.5,7,0,??
Daksh Soni, Its USP is its ambience. The place is so much neat and clean. A total treat for the eyes and for the health as well. The Rawa Masala Dosa was sumptuous and the Rawa Idli was also tasty.

Food Love," Whenever I get the craving to eat some south Indian food, a name immediately comes to my mind which is none other than sagarratna. I have been to their C.P branch and it was crowded so much that I had to wait for a good half an hour. The effect of which was my appetite reduced to some level till my order arrived.

RishWish," The quality of the food here has definitely changed a lot over the years but this restaurant continues to serve decent South Indian food. I have tried North Indian here just once and it was the usual punjabi palette, nothing extraordinary. It's funny that the place also offers Chinese cuisine which I haven't and probably won't bother to try. Below are pictures of Rasam (piping hot and richly flavored), Mysore Masala Dosa (all time favourite), Rava Masala Dosa (decent enough but a bit too oily) served with Coconut chutney (served cold and fresh) and Sambar (okay-ish).", 3.5,73,235,??
Prateek Bhattu, I have been to many sagar ratna so comparing is easy for me. I won't say it is bad but also needs improvement. Ambience is good. Service is just okay but taste is very nice. I ordered a thali that was sufficient for me., 3.0,19,72,??

Ayushie Mathur,"Rated What do I say about this place? First of all, it's huge. It has very creative interiors using all recycled material right from old glass bottles to tyres to metal bearings. What's better? They serve hookah with a massive variety of flavours. Their menu is divided into healthy food options and indulging food options both with lip smacking food. Yes though, this place is a bit expensive which it owes to it's location and wonderful interiors.

Dr Ashwani Mehta,Rated Situated in the outer circle of CP in N block on the second floor is junk yard cafe. Landed there at lunch time. Huge place nicely done up. Bright vibrant colours with patch work sofas. Nice huge bar. I loved the ambience and the work man suits the waiters wore in mustard colour the restaurent gave a feel that I was going to have a great time. Down hill it went like a plane without engines as soon I started ordering. Little informed service staff was a red flag. Indicated no training. Not all bar items were available. Ordered Falafel with pita Junk yard special veg burger Where falafel should have been light/herbaceous/ flavoured with spices it was dense tasteless and hard. Pita was like a thin chapati with flour literally falling from it when we picked it up. The burger had under-spiced pasty patty and mouth feel was gooey. Service staff inattentive.

Saransh Singhal,"Rated After a detailed overview of 4-5 restaurants, we decided to visit this place as the place is really big and serves some delicious momos I have heard of. The management has actually used the word JUNKYARD with the ambience of the restaurant very accurately and beautifully. Big nice custom made sofas and furniture. We ordered a hukka, Honey chilly potatoes, smoked cheese balls, Chicken shish taouk (Recommended by server), chicken & chive dim sums, Junkyard special veg burger, cheese Garlic bread, a minto plus fresh fruit concoction and a mojito. Hukka: They have some really cool big giant hukka's. Can you imagine, it lasted for 3 lonnng hours and that too without any hassle. Thick smoke with smoothness at its best. Honey Chilly potato & Cheese balls: Honey chilly potatoes were crisp-skinned and hot. Light, yummy, sweet and crunchy with the right balance of spices and honey. Smoked cheese balls along with white cheese sauce were a delight to eat. It was delicious and quite filling. Dimsums: They came in a bamboo steam box covered with 5 different sauce. The first bite took me into my deep little corner of savouriness. It was piping hot, filled with juices and the homemade sweet chilli just added a cherry on it. They just made me go 'mmmm'. Chicken shish taouk & cheese garlic bread: I cannot remember the last time I had such dry brittle chewy chicken in a nice place like this. Maybe it was brushed with an egg as I could smell egg and it was like eating a unseasoned omelette. The cheese garlic bread was crisp and was brushed with butter but without cheese, it felt incomplete. junkyard special veg burger & mocktails: It came with a lip-smacking white sauce which enhanced the flavour of the burger. All together it was satisfying. Mojito was flavourless and flat, but the minto plus was the winner among two. Watermelon intensified its awesome sweetness and flavour. Lastly: You can count on them if you want to try something new and you don't have to listen to the phrase 'sorry sir, right now we don't have this'. If you love hukka and momos, then you can easily bet on this place. Price is normal if you compare with other restaurants around here. mytummygrows.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The entrance from the street is a little hard to locate but worth the effort. (Look for the small sign by the lift). Quirky well finished interior, super friendly, non-pushy staff and a manager, Mr Nitin Jayant who ensures you have a great experience. We had starters, mains, desserts and coffee, beer and cocktails (get the Edison bulb worth the presentation as well as taste).

The place was not even full mind you. The Hukaah had to be changed 4-5 times before they got it right.

Vasundhra Gupta,"Rated One of the most disappointing experiences ever (and I've had my fair share). Other than the ambiance, I have nothing nice to say about the place. Why? 1. Right off the bat, the washrooms were without water in the taps. In the middle of the day, at the peak lunch hour, where your restaurant is functional and people are coming in, you'd expect that this issue would be attended swiftly. Till the end of my time there, the situation remained the same with the staff who simply nodded and walked off. 2. Having ordered a basic falafel and pita platter, and paying 800 bucks after tax, you could expect the food to have been phenomenal. And yet, here we were, sitting in utter shock and disappointment from the average taste and small quantity. 3. We ordered the peanut butter shake and peach iced tea - both which were HORRIBLE. I am not exaggerating. We took a sip, and asked the steward to take the drinks away, as we will not entertain this any longer. We cancelled the rest of our order, paid for the Falafel platter and left. All in all, a very short and unmemorable experience which leads me to say that I will not be returning to the place, and will not recommend the same to anyone. 2/5 goes only the ambiance of the place.",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Karishma Singh,"Rated Loved it! Completely! It's an amazing and such a fun place to go to. Loved the ambiance and decor, and the food too. The staff was very kind and friendly. Lovely place to be for a brunch or an evening out. We ordered Grilled Chicken and Spinach Salad with Pineapple Dressing, A Peri Peri Pizza, and a Butterscotch Cold Coffee. The salad was cold and great, and had chunky pieces of chicken. The Peri Peri Pizza was delicious. The chicken on the pizza tasted fantastic, and the pizza itself was very cheesy. The Butterscotch cold coffee was lip smacking, frothy, and sweet. Overall, had an amazing time. Would love to visit again. Decor - 5/5 Food - 5/5 Budget - 4/5 Ambiance - 5/5",Rated 4.5,6,35,??

Gayatri Mohan,"Rated Huge place with ample seating, both indoor and outdoor. Classic old school American pub with loud music (mostly pop and soft rock), wooden everything and a lot of cool knick knacks to gawk at (The Mona Lisa in particular). They let us smoke sheesha indoors which was convenient for us. The finger food and drinks in general were great. Nothing we ordered was disappointing. The Nachos need to be tried. A good laid back place to chill with friends.",Rated 4.0,12,8,??
Bedo Dutta,"Rated Well, what a place... The ambience, be it rooftop or the indoor one, is brilliant and creatively made of *Dramatic Music* 'you got it' *snare drums* ""JUNK""... Tada... The waiters are well behaved and the services are fairly good enough. Prices are neither way too high nor too low and the food is value for money. Their menu is creative and divided on the basis of calories. Will recommend JimBeam. And for food try Lamb Seekh Kebabs, Fish and Chips and Chicken Steak. As for Non Alcoholic drinks, Try Hot Choclate Brownie. Loved the place. Keep up the good job.",Rated 4.5,7,55,??
Akshat Kalra,"Rated So I bumped on to this place by accident. I was looking for The Townhouse Cafe and saw this Cafe. Man it was a great decision. Super amazing music played by the DJ on a chilly Friday night. Food - I drank too much that night and just had a white sauce spaghetti pasta. It was good, creamy and too many veggies ( I paid 80 bucks extra for the veggies). All in all a good experience. Had a lot of fun.",Rated 4.0,19,55,??
Shivam Gupta,"Rated Look & Feel - crazy design skills and ideas, theme based caf. Totally resembles a junkyard. HAPPENING PLACE Food quality is great and tastes yummy. They also have an outdoor section - We choose the same. The place is huge and spacious. The interior is very innovatively done using junk. Ambience- 5/5 Food-4/5 Service-4/5 Value for money-4/5 I would recommend kindly book your table in advance if you don't want to wait here to grab a table.",Rated 4.5,87,206,??
Tushar Dunga,Rated The junkyard cafe people are really annoying and provide false commitment.I went there yesterday with my friends(12 in total) after booking the reservation with one of their managers over the phone.I specifically asked them if they have a DJ night and the manager confirmed stating that DJ is available on all 7 days and we have Bollywood night today.When we checked in to the cafe while placing the order we again checked with the boy who was taking our order regarding the DJ and the order taker also confirmed that DJ will start at 7:30 PM so we placed our order. After an hour we again asked one of their managers to confirm when will the DJ starts and they confirmed that it will start at 9:30.We waited patiently hoping that we will get some music and when we confirmed with them again at 9:30 PM there manager told us that on Sunday's they don't play loud music and we all were so disappointed to hear that.I have their recordings where their manager where they have confirmed that it is Bollywood night which was not the case.After fighting for more than an hour they decided to give is 15% of discount which was of no use so we decided to pay the bill and move to Townhouse Cafe which is on the first floor of the same building.I would request all of you not to visit Junkyard as they make false commitments and they deny from their statements on your face.Townhouse cafe on the other hand is an excellent place as i called them as well and they denied in the first go that they have live band which was the case.We enjoyed every bit of our time at townhouse cafe.I have already shared the same with my friends and have asked not to go to Junkyard as its a stupid place.,Rated 1.0,1,4,??
Suhael Buttan,"Rated The junkyard cafe has a pretty unique concept with the interiors made of junk and antiques which gives the place a different yet attractive look. They have a nice and decent sized outdoor seating too. The music is always pretty good and a nice mix of genres is played. Coming to the food , I've mainly tried their finger foods like French fries , chips and dip, nachos and wedges which were nicely done but they can increase the quantity. Coming to the non veg section , their chilly chicken and chicken tikka is quite nice. The pieces are tender and juicy with the right balance of spices. As far as drinks are concerned, the rates are reasonable if you go for combos and their cocktails are quite decent too. I feel they can still reduce the prices of the shots they offer for a jger bomb is a tad expensive when compared to other cafes in the neighbourhood. The place is jam packed on weekends. So a reservation is a must. Will definitely be visiting again!",Rated 4.0,29,128,??

Piyush Nahata,"Rated Delhi, I've been to cafe's and lounges and there is a difference between both of them. However to spot and ensure the difference is maintained. Mr. Umang Tewarihas done a superb job in educating delhi. It stands out in every way possible and the brand is unerring with its approach and using it in various verticals from cocktails to food platter. This place is visit and pocket friendly, They've got good nights lined up The drawbacks of this place is that the staff has a laid back attitude. If i could sum it up, great food and cocktails, however the service staff and managers are in their own world unless you tell them you are going to review them on zomato or facebook.",Rated 3.5,42,516,??
HippieSoul,Rated This is a good place to rejuvenate yourself. It's a big place made up of junk items surely going to please your eyes. The place is raw but still done in a very good taste. Service staff looks smart and educated. The taste of food can be improved upon else everything is fine. The food is priced on a little expensive side though the alcohol rate is good.,Rated 4.0,45,78,??

Mehak Sapra,Rated The Junkyard cafe- as the name clearly defines its amazing interiors..the furniture is really handpicked and crafted very well.. The ceiling is made up of bottles and ambience is really cool.. You can get option to sit indoor or under the blue sky...The food served was delicious and the staff was also good.. We even got 15% discount as we had reserved the table from DineOut App.. Everything was served on time and its surely a must visit place once,Rated 3.5,38,116,??
Sanchi Soota,"Rated The outdoor seating at junkyard is a nice place to be on a winter afternoon. The interiors are really well done too but we chose to sit outside. The menu is artistically planned, considering a variety of options for the health geeks specifically mentioning the calories in each item. We were really in a mood for pizza so we ordered a lamb seekh pizza which was good, but a little oily. They have a preperation of fresh healthy juices from watermelon to beetroot with a twist. These were a good try. The watermelon one had Ming and kafir lime and was very refreshing.",Rated 4.0,14,129,??
Girish Kumar,"Rated The ambience and decor clearly justifies its name ""Junky"".Situated at the second floor in outer circle opposite KG marg. You have two option here either you can sit outside or inside. The interiors were very unique like the name suggests it was giving a feel of junkyard but not in the bad sense. There was also an old plane hanging on the roof near bar. And the bar area was amazing. Edison bulb and Graveyard Cocktails served in a tungsten bulb and a skeleton head shaped glasses respectively. But what stole our hearts was the hookah.. Flavored hookah and it was one if the best and smoothest hookahs I've ever had. It was like hitting the right spot. The perfect hit. Talking about the food..... When it comes to food, we ordered a Smoked Chicken Caesar Salad, Grilled Chicken Breast with Couscous and Healthy Fish & prawns . The salad was good with fresh lettuce, large chunks of smoked chicken and nice cheese shavings. The healthy version of the fish (only 373 calories, claims the menu card). The Grilled Chicken Breast was served with a small portion of Couscous (good), a tangy and spicy red sauce and grilled vegetables. The chicken breast was fibrous and so were the vegetables served with it. Prawns were really good..Prawns were crispy n properly cooked. The staff is very courteous too.They wear orange colour dress and it looks very cool.. Thumbs up for this place.Will be visiting again soon . Keep it up guys!

Priyanshu Kumar,"Rated The Junkyard Cafe - the name itself gives you the very first idea to of the place. It is a concept restaurant which has got nice curated junk artifacts, decors, seatings everything made out of different junk and waste materials. The place is one of its kind and unique in everything . The place has got some reall great art pieces installed all around the place - 8000 beer pint bottles placed on the ceiling to start with, then comes the transformers robot, old transistors, sound sytems, signages etc. The place has got seating carved out of a car, big drums etc. The place has got nice lovely decor and dimmed lighting. The menu is vast and varied. you get all kind of cuisines with a few dishes mentioning calories stats for all health lovers. Now coming on to their food and drinks - I had a few cocktails and mocktails, which were all great at taste. Some great and must have here are - Bourbon Wreckage Fluid, Floral salvage fluid - both are served in unique bamboo cans. Edison bulb 1 uniquely presented with nice gaseous flow and great at taste. Skeleton 1 is great at presentation, served in skull shaped bottle, hard in nature, perfect at taste. In non alcoholic beverages one should go for - Watermelon, Pomegranate, Beetroot and Sweet lime - all were great at taste and refreshing in nature. food- I tried Fish and chips with tartare sauce, Pailard of chicken with lemon and herbs, bhatti ka murg tikka, lamb seekh kebab, prawn salt and pepper, sichuan chicken dimsum, chicken and chive dimsum were great and awesome at taste. Perfectly cooked, properly presented. Loved everything 1 Asparagus and black fungus dimsum wasnt that great....smoked chicken pepper was crunchy, cpould have been juicier for a better experience. Desserts - White chocolate Raspeberry truffle and Nutella Cheesecake were awesome at taste and must have here. The Brainfreezer Sheesha here is a must have. Smooth and great. The hospitality of the manager SHERA RAWAT was awesome. The staffs and service is prompt and freiendly. Thumbs up for everything...loved being here. Perfect place for corporate, friendly parties etc.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
