Sonia Chhillar,"Going to Dunkin' Donuts is always a happy experience. Pleasant music and to add to charm is the dining area. A very filling variety of burgers, Naughty Lucy veg. is a must try. Wicked wraps are something unavoidable if you go there. Coffee tastes very nice, even the simplest Classic has its own taste and so are the milkshakes especially Fruit berry. Love it. Simply Awesome!",4.5,6,2,??

Kaustav Datta - Foodiepanda,"Owned and operated by the Jubilant Foods group in India, Dunkin Donuts is one of the best global food chains to have come to India and establish their business. My experience at their Connaught Place outlet is a testimony to that excellence. ABSOLUTE LOVE!! That's what I feel for this place. I went there with a group of friends and tried out some of the best items I'd heard on their menu. Much to my delight, they were all amazing! AMBIANCE: The place is easy to locate and the decor is simply beautiful, comfy and warm. CCDs, I feel, are pass for dates these days. One needs to explore newer and better options for a simple lunch date or a place to hangout with friends and chill, and Dunkin Donuts is just the place you might want to be. They have the same kind of decor at most outlets: a blue wall with colourful face murals hanging, white brick walls with black boards and chalk drawings filling them up and probably, a soft corner area with some sofas and a lampshade. Perfectly comfortable and cozy. SERVICE: The place is a counter service outlet where you place your order and collect the same at the counter itself before you leave. The food is served quick and fast and the person handling the counter was agile and courteous. A polite staff is always a welcome sight at major food chain outlets. FOOD: We went in a group of 3 folks (all non-vegetarians) and one of us was giving a treat, so we spared no expense in trying what we really wanted to. We ordered - Double Mutton Burger - Spicy Grilled Chicken Burger - Jamaican Rum and Almonds - Mocha Chip - Virgin Mojito Coolatta - Death by Chocolate Donut - Nutty Strawberry Donut The BURGERS were good. I specially liked the Spicy Grilled Chicken Burger more than the Double Mutton Burger. The Chicken burger was really delicious; right amount of sauces and beautifully spiced patty with soft and fresh bread. Not much of a dressed up burger, but certainly tasty as such. The Mutton burger had a slight hint of mustard sauce and some onion rings stacked on a mutton patty. A little less meaty I guess, and also lacked some strength in taste. I've heard much about the Naughty Lucy burgers here and certainly intend to try them next time. Amongst the drinks, we really loved the Jamaican Rum and Almonds and the Mocha Chip very much. Certainly a delight to accompany any burger or croissant here. The Virgin Mojito Coolatta was good too! Strong and fresh minty in taste! I really loved them all. The DONUTS were perfect!! The Death by Chocolate is my personal favorite pick of the two. The chocolate layering was so warm and yummy! It kinda melts in your spoon itself even before it reaches your tongue. The smell and taste is so so enticing! I loved every bite of it with equal undivided love :P The Nutty Strawberry was tasty too. It was a ring type donut with a layering of strawberry cream and small chunks of nuts scattered over it. Certainly a good choice. I personally though want to try out more of their Chocolate donuts. Make sure to take an entire pack of all their different chocolate flavored donuts when you're there. You WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!! VALUE FOR MONEY: The place is certainly a good and viable choice for its donuts and accompanying drinks. For the food, the place might be a bit over-valuing the items. Overall, I'd say a decently priced place that provides some really good options compared to other chains.

Shagun Garg,This one has a great variety of doughnuts available in different flavors. I just love the ugly Strawberry one and tried it twice. They introduce new fare after every few months. Their Naughty Lucy burger is a must try. It is filled up with a huge amount of cheese inside the patty. Everything here is high on calories so choose your option wisely!,4.0,20,80,??
Manavv Piplani (Bribing Stomach),"A great place to visit if you have a sweet tooth but also if you are a burger lover, They have alot of variety in burgers & wraps and their drinks can't go unnoticed.

Aditi Malhotra,"Given Enough Coffee You Could Shake The World!!! This is what Dunkin Donut claims as they launch some very interesting new coffees. Its not a very regular thing when innovation with coffee happens. We may visit different cafes, and they might name their coffees differently, but they all end up tasting the same, with hardly a difference to make out. To bridge this gap, Dunkin has really gone overboard in their research and come up with not one but four new coffees, and these coffees are of the kinds that we normally don't get in coffee shops. The first coffee is named Bangalore Start-Up Coffee. As the name suggests, its for the night owls busy working on ideas that will one day(hopefully) change the world. A 100% Arabica roast coffee beans decoction, in piping hot milk, inspired by South-Indian filter coffee and the start-up culture. But you really don't need to be in a start-up to drink this one. This coffee reminded me of the coffee I drink at home every morning, which is basically coffee added to a warm glass of milk. To get this kind of homely taste in a coffee shop, is something we never expect. We go to coffee shops for fancy coffees, but sometimes what you really need is that feeling of home comfort, home like taste and Bingo, this coffee gives you exactly that. The next coffee, is meant strictly for bold and daring people, because this guy is tough and its actually named Tough Guy Cappuccino. This coffee is like the real friend who has no sympathy for you, he is like the friend who tells you, your face is dirty and you look like an idiot, when other friends like your pic on the social media, this coffee makes you wake up and smell the coffee. The triple shot of dark roasted espresso with a tint of brandy is so tough that you can't escape the reality. Do not drink this one if you are clear-headed! I personally liked this coffee the most, though the comfortable Bangalore Start-Up Coffee reminded me of home like taste, this one truly became my best friend. The aroma of coffee, the tint of brandy, made it a more than perfect combination when in need to think clear. I am gonna go back a lot to Dunkin for this tough guy, because you don't find guys like this easily these days ;) I even clicked a selfie with this one :) What do you do, when somedays you felt like being held, you hold a cup of fuzzy mix of chocolate and coffee, with whipped cream for some extra love and cinnamon for the feeling to linger. This is the coffee you hold when you need to be held. Its your partner in therapy, its called the Therapeutic Cappuccino. And just as the name says, it is that therapy you need when sometimes you are too low or even too happy, its a coffee, you at back and relax with. Its a coffee that makes you forget things happening around you, its a coffee, that even after its finished, makes it difficult to part with. So its really not a coffee, its a therapy, its a coffee spa, its a massage, that you want to go on and on with. The chocolate and coffee mix, the sweetness of whipped cream and that dash of cinnamon, all put together make it more than a perfect combination of tastes. And last but not the least, came the coffee which had no story, it was too direct and straightforward. Simply a no nonsense stuff, a straight up black coffee, minus the bitterness. This is one thing that we all drink black coffee for, for it being straight, strong and directly hard hitting, and at the same time, we still dislike the too much of bitterness it comes with. I am personally very fond of black coffee, but yes honestly speaking, the bitter taste it leaves me with, is not quite liked. Duncan has really found a solution to it, and come up with a coffee, which is black, but doesn't taste bitter. And to substantiate the difference, we were served a Dunkin Black along with a regular Americano Black Coffee. The difference was very very evident and Dunkin gives me another reason to go back to them. In fact Dunkin has really given me 4 new reasons to go back to them again and again and I definitely will. I am very sure that these four new coffees will give coffee lovers a lot of reason to visit Dunkin Donuts soon and I recommend tasting all of them, so at least 4 visits for that and then keep going back for one or the other :) facebook.com",4.0,10,66,??
