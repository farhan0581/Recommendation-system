Vaishali Babbar,Rated Last Sunday night it was the second time I had visited Unplugged Courtyard with two friends. This place has a very young and fresh feel. The menu was also quite good. The best thing that I had here was the kadai paneer with butter naan. The staff was quite polite. Thanks for making the evening so gud for us.,Rated 4.0,17,155,??
Anupriya Jolly Chugh,"Rated Please go there for the ambience but also for the delicious food. The sitting which is mostly outdoor is the prettiest you can come across in CP. The drinks are a must have. The Giardino served in a lamp is beautiful and refreshing. The Nutty Jack is a delightful drink Bailey's, Jack Daniels served with peanut butter. Aam Papad Caprioska a perfect summer drink with chunks of aam papad. Starters: I absolutely recommend the Ganna Chicken a kebab wrapped on small sticks of sugar cane. Aam Aadmi Chicken yummy and spicy, this us served in a steel tiffin like old times. Chilli Paneer Ghosla is a nest of fried noodles stuffed with chilli panner topped with cheese slices. Red Gull Croquettes are cheese and potato croquettes served with a special redbull sauce. Main Course: the main course is filling and desi at heart. The Traphalgar Chicken Curry is perfectly spiced chicken curry. The biryani is on my must eat list. Desserts : the desserts are molecular gastronomy style. So we had a special UC Cake which is a cake and icing dipped in liquid nitrogen and topped with sauce. Molecular Lollies too are made with liquid nitrogen.",Rated 4.5,73,358,??
Ajay Singh,"Rated As I was coming down the stairs of Odeon Cinema I saw this place right in front the theatre's exit. The music and the menu seemed just right. We wanted to go to Odeon Social but this place really lured us in. Its basically an outdoor seated restaurant with a small seating area indoors we well. The courtyard looks smashing with a couple of big trees in it. The terrace is more of a regular area similar to other restaurants in CP. The ever smiling attendant Himanshu was more than willing to show us around and let us decide the area we wanted to be seated in. We chose to sit in the courtyard. The music was really soothing and went rather with the sombre ambiance of the place. We ordered a few beers , a susst soya and a falafel dish. The food was good , I liked the soya dish better than the falafel one. The service was great and the staff really attentive and pretty accommodating to guest's requests. A big thumbs up. Keep it Up Guys!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Pulkit Batheja,"Rated Great ambience. Fine food. A little expensive, but worth visiting. I went to UC with one of my friends and we ordered one Mumbai Dabba and one Unplugged Chicken Platter. For beverages we had Courtyard Special Cold Coffee and Kiwi Mojito. Everything was just awesome. I've never had a better Chicken Curry, not even at Nizamuddin or Chandni Chowk. Special Recommendation: would be the cold coffee. I can go this place just to sit at the terrace and enjoy the coffee. The Courtyard area is also very beautiful and it looks just amazing at night with the lights hanging from the tree. I would definitely recommend this place for a date. It is a calm and soothing place with great music. Enjoy. :)",Rated 4.0,5,0,??

The food is so yummy... we were 2 ordered 2dishes and a cosmopolitan drink costing only 1300 i mean its written 1600 over here n we were full already... good thing is its very nearby to my place n i have found a pretty awesome place to hang around...

Life On A Rainbow,"Rated It's really pretty to start with. It's actually a fancy courtyard with dazzling lights and great music to lift up the ambience. Being the typical foodie I had done my zomato research before visiting the place. Contrary to what I read in other reviews I genuinely thought the service was really warm and quick. The quirky menu definitely stands out with the ""not so usual"" decor. UnfortunatelyI only had vegetarian , although that too was quite good. In the middle circle of a busy Connaught place this place is one wonder you should definitely visit :)",Rated 4.5,20,19,??

Pathetic good quality and service. We ordered chicken white sauce pasta,Oreo shakes and strawberry shake; when our order came that too after almost half an hour...pasta was not good at all in taste and that strawberry shake was yuck,sour like any medicine.

Vaibhav Aggarwal,"Rated The open area of the restaurant has got quite a nice feel to it, even though the indoors is a little blah. Was perfect for a pleasantly sunny afternoon. But as regards my first impression, I was disappointed by the fact that nobody bothered to attend for quite long, after me being seated. Although the service did improve as the meal progressed, it still needs to improve. Coming to the food, I tried their Butter Chicken Tikka and Cajun Shawarma Gyro. To drink, I tried their Oriental Bloom and Virgin Mojito mocktails. The Chicken Tikka by itself wasn't very great, but coupled with the butter chicken gravy, it seemed nice. The Shawarma Gyro was nice, but I've had better ones elsewhere. The Virgin Mojito was quite nice, and the Oriental Bloom was really really good. As regards the food alone, I might have given the place a 3.5 (coupled with the service) but the ambience and the feel of the place added to it. There was also lovely live saxophone music also being played, which added to the experience. It's a good place to visit with family, as well as with friends. Besides all of this, there are also some ideas like the bill being served in a miniature post box, among other things, which are done well.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Prerna Kapoor,"Rated An amazing piece of artwork in form of a cafe, blended beautifully with the nature in midst of historic roads of connaught place! Unplugged courtyard! A great place to dine in with friends and family. The three tier ambience (outdoor, indoor and terrace) is what makes this place all the more special.

Gitesh K,"Rated This one is not just a restaurant, it's an experience. An out of Delhi experience sitting in the heart of Delhi. Specially when the live music is playing and the crowd gets on it's feet to hum, sing and clap along. The variety of talent that plays at Unplugged.. itself is sufficient to encourage one to visit this place again and again. Great ambience... Good food.. Great music! A couple of minor disappointments. Service... Nothing major but certainly not up to the mark. The guys serving just aren't trained and ready for this level. This has to be THE focus area for restaurant management. Second... The portion sizes are a bit too small. Sure not everyone cares about this when quality of food is good and ambience/music is superb. But I always enjoy everything more when I have my tummy full. After all it's a restaurant and food has few other uses than to just look good on Instagram. Or may be whatever we tried was just too delish! Looking forward to my next visit..",Rated 4.5,14,8,??

Arush Chikersal,Rated I first visited this place on bday of my friend and we were around 15 people and I simply loved the place. Beautifully done. Decent food. Thereafter a couple of weeks later I again went to this place for another friends b'day and their security men at the entry thought for a while that there are no girls this time and immediately after with a fake expression told us that they are booked for the day. This is ridiculous. At 7pm they are full? I would recommend this place strictly if you are with girls. Crazy and sick place with 10 bouncers at the entry.,Rated 1.0,23,211,??
Akashdeep Singh (Travellersfoodboxx),"Rated #UnlockUnplugged This place has so much beauty added to it, that one cant refrain himself from admiring it. Since it inception, it was the first time i visited the place and never really knew that it would turn out to be one of great experiences. The interiors are rustic, ambience is full of lights, and quirkiness. They have an indoor, outdoor and rooftop sitting. I choose their outdoor just because of the lighting done their. In terms of service and food quality unplug lived up to my expectations. We ordered Ganna chicken, Butter chicken tikka, spring rolls and chicken steam momos. The taste was exceptional, my personal favorite was ganna chicken. In cocktail i ordered a naughty jack and it was heaven. Base of jack daniel with an option to stir it with peanut butter, the combination was amazing.

Meenakshi Srivastav,"Rated While roaming around in CP, we saw this place and popped into it for a quick bite. This newly opened place has a welcoming & eye catching ambience with commodious interiors (elegant & innovative) & exteriors (wooden dcor) seating area. Their kitchen is ready to serve the food loving customers with multi cuisines dishes. The menu is pretty rich having a wide range of sumptuous dishes. We ordered Corona (beer), Aam Papad drink, Ganna Chicken (yummy juicy chicken seekh on a sugarcane stick) & Ghosla Chilli Paneer everything was temptingly taste especially Ganna Chicken. Its a great value for money. An overall good experience. The management seems to be working on feedbacks and trying to enhance the services and overall experience.

Sidhant Ahuja,"Rated Unplugged Courtyard is the latest buzz in town. Located at one of the best locations in the forever buzzing Connaught Place this place will certainly take your breath away. It is a massive place with plenty of seating arrangement.The large outdoor seating is perfect for evenings when the place is beautifully lit.The entire decor is chic and classic. The indoor section has a very rustic vibe while the outdoor part has a podium for live music performances which is perfect for winter evenings and the beautiful lights hanging from the tree will definitely set you in a mood.They also have a massive terrace which also has a bar for those who want to spend quiet time with family or friends. They have a variety of cocktails with amazing presentation some of them include Nutty Jack which was a Jack Daniels based cocktail having a strong coffee and vanilla flavour tastes best with peanut butter. Some other recommended drinks are UC special Margarita and Ginger Sour. Food Talk Ganna Chicken Skewers:- The most talked about dish of this place. Juicy Chicken wrapped in ganna sticks with flavors of ganna coming along with is to die for. Perfect starter to go with drinks. Dynamite Prawns :- This dish has certainly lived upto its name. The prawns were literally dynamite in nature and were delicious in taste. Served in a martini glass with lettuce as the base and topped with cumin seeds are highly recommended for sea food lovers. Chilli Paneer Khosla :- This was a very different and innovative item for me. Small pieces of paneer wrapped in a small edible khosla and topped with a cheese slice is heaven for all vegetarians. The presentation of this dish was class apart. Also this is one of the first place where I tried braai cuisine and feel in love with it. Tried the Zanzibar Masala Chicken Tangadi was Chicken Tangadi with different flavours altogether. Quite a good change from the normal chicken we eat. Aam Aadmi Chicken :- This was served in a tiffin box. This was boneless chicken having a strong achari flavor. Red Ghull Croquettes:- These were cheesy croquettes served with red bull sauce. The sauce had a tangy flavor. In main course Traphalgar Chicken Curry was the best. Also the biryani was amazing in taste. It was a perfect mix of Indian spices and really good. Moving on to the desserts the UC cake which comes in two flavours vanilla and chocolate were just splendid. Cake put in dry ice topped with whipped cream ,peanuts and chocolate syrup. The most innovative dessert I have seen. Even the UC lollipops were really addictive coming in different flavors of strawberry,kiwi and chocolate. A perfect example of molecular gastronomy. On the whole UC has changed the entire Connaught Place from introducing braai cuisine to molecular desserts they have it all.",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Akriti Jain,"Rated It might have taken some time but I found the best crispy prawns on the planet! I can easily say that an incredibly talented and experienced team of chefs and food consultants are the reason behind the huge success of Unplugged Courtyard in Connaught Place. The menu has been planned out very well with cuisines from all over the world keeping in mind peoples palate and taste preferences. Setting the talk about food aside for a while, the ambiance and service deserve a mention. The interiors of the restaurant are done up really well giving out a vintage feel and vibe. Weekends are designed around having live bands, dance sessions and the staff takes care in giving out the best experience and good service. I will start my review with the dish I liked the most (the one mentioned above), crispy dynamite prawns. They are served in a margarita glass with lettuce, mandolin baby radishes and thyme leaves making the entree look really fancy and colorful. Deep fried and rolled in hot sauce, these mini bite size prawns have just the right amount of crunch and spice, make sure to wash them down a glass of chilled beer! They are absolutely to die for. Red-bull croquettes- a thick dressing made with red bull comes in a syringe alongside vegetable croquettes. Crispy batter on the outside and wonderfully soft filling inside, my way of eating them is breaking them into two and pouring the sauce in the middle. A serving of this and youre good to go! Ganna chicken- The overall look of the dish is very appetizing; chicken mince is wrapped around tiny sugarcane sticks which imparts sweet flavor into the meat. The good thing about it is that the sweetness is not overpowering and is toned down with the addition of sweet chili sauce that comes along with it. From the other starters I tried, aam aadmi chicken had a combination of a lot of flavors (Paratha, Chicken, Dal Makhni and Mix Veg) which led to a slight confusion in terms of which one I liked the most. Sust soya kebab and chilly paneer cups are quite regular in taste. The soya kebabs were bland and under-seasoned. Chilly paneer was good in taste but did not require the cheese slice. Among the mocktails and cocktails, here are few I really liked: Aam papad caprioska- A concoction of crushed ice, aam papad and lemon is served in an old fashioned copper glass. It is deliciously refreshing and works really well as a palate cleanser between two courses. Watermelon-mint sangria in white wine and Aam panna Sangrias are my all time favorite; whether its a girls night out or a dinner, I usually end up ordering white wine sangrias. This one is made with mint, watermelon, white wine and tastes divine. Aam panna is a mocktail served with coriander and a hint of chili. If you love summer coolers, this is the drink you should go for. Nutty Jack- Take a bite of the peanut butter and then a sip of this cocktail made with coffee and Jack Daniels. Very unique and distinct in taste, it starts with a sweet flavor and goes on to taste a little bitter towards the end. Simply genius! Coming to the desserts, I liked the nitrogen lollipops that are prepared at your table. They come in three flavors, kiwi, raspberry and chocolate. Each lollipop has a different taste which resembles flavored candies and treats we used to eat when we were kids. I also tried another dessert from their menu, Brownie ke pakode- For me, there was too much whipped cream for the serving and the oil from the deep fried brownies ended up making the dish look really messy. Restaurants like Unplugged are working towards bringing international cuisines and techniques to the Indian market and are doing a fantastic job with it. I am really looking forward to experience the massive wave of the food world that is on its way to our country. Food and everything associated with it is going to be the next big thing our eyes are going to see. Hold tight!

Tanush Singh Sangwan,"Rated I have been to hookah lounge's, been to cafe's of the alcoholic persuasion . But I have never been to one where they mix with such ease. It's open it's pleasant, they play beautiful music. And the food has been experimented with a delicious way , I will make sure to visit them again to try the other items on the menu. The only sore point was in service the man serving me and my friend when asked by me if he could serve us hoegaarden beer this guy kept trying to polish off a carona on to us, when I reaffirmed on my preference he again tries to polish if off on me. I am sorry but that experience just stopped me from giving them the full 5 score they deserved.",Rated 4.5,20,118,??
K.D.licious,"Rated Finally got an opportunity to visit this awesome place. Perfect ambiance, an open roof, open garden and a closed sitting with fully equipped bar. The butlers were very polite and welcoming and gave assistance at regular intervals i.e. were very responsive. The manager was very attentive and was on his toes and asked for feedback from every customer out there. We ordered their special red gull injection shots and malai chaanp. Red gull shots RATED 4.5 - Perfectly cooked with mashed potatoes were served with an injection containing mayo sauce and orange creamy sauce made with carrot, very juicy just melts in your mouth. Will only taste great when eaten hot. Soya Malai Chaanp -RATED - 4.5 - Super creamy ,super fresh, very soft & perfectly grilled, these pieces of soya were delicious to have. Served with mint sauce they just get your tongue craving for more. Overall a very good experience, though i tried very few dishes but will surely try many more in coming weekends.

Rishabh,Rated Wanted to go to unplugged courtyard for some time now. Finally went there. Ambience is very nice. All open. Service is a little disappointing. Had to call in manager twice to get things right. Food was OK. I specifically like the way aam aadmi chicken was brought by the waiter to our table. Desserts 'lollies' were the best.

The Feast That's Life,"Rated Unplugged Courtyard is a new casual dining restaurant, opened up in Connaught Place, which boasts of splendid drinks and amazing food with a focus on local product, high quality ingredients and fusion flavours. A far cry from the tiny, congested restaurants that are cropping up in many parts of the city, Unplugged Courtyard has no shortage of space, and they have used it pretty well. They have outdoor as well as indoor seating, along with a terrace dining area. But the outdoor seating area on the ground floor is by far the most beautiful. It has pebble pathways, cabanas, beautiful lighting and unbelievably, a Neem tree at the centre, and is perfect for date-night. The terrace area is more casual, though really well decked-up, with a live grill in tow. The indoor dining area has plush leather sofas and wooden furnishings. Also, there is a bar in each section and an open kitchen in the indoor area. The place has a very relaxed vibe to it, with mellow music playing in the background, so that one can have a conversation while still enjoying the music. The basic concept behind the restaurant was to provide a place where we can cut-off or unplug from the monotony, stress and worries of everyday life, and just relax and enjoy a nice meal. We started off with a few mocktails- Parfait Amour: A nice concoction of lime, pomegranate and cardamom- a good option for those who dont like their drinks too sweet. My sweet babe: This drink was on the sweeter side- predominantly consisting of orange juice and orange segments. Indiana: This drink was basically a spiced aam panna with green chillies and coriander. It was spicy and refreshing and the flavours were so well balanced. An incredible drink and an absolute must-try here! Oriental Bloom: Another stellar drink, and something very different, the drink had a base of litchi juice, rose water and lots of ice, and was flavoured with star anise and kaffir lime leaf. Though all of these individually are very strong flavours, they were balanced perfectly in the drink. We then went on to the starters: Butter Chicken Tikka: Wonder why nobody thought of this before- chicken tikka with a butter chicken marinade. Not only was the tikka juicy, but the butter chicken marinade totally elevated the flavours. A must-try for all butter chicken lovers. Amritsari Fried Fish: The batter was crispy and well-seasoned and the fish was cooked really well, but it could have been a tad less oily. Lebanese platter: Lamb Shish Kebab and Smoked Chicken. The shish kebab had been flavoured with a lovely mix of spices, which enhanced the taste of the meat without overpowering it. The smoked chicken was also quite tasty, with a subtle marinade. Veg platter: The platter consisted of Paneer Tikka, Afghani Broccoli, Soya Chaap and Punjabi Falafel. The paneer was marinated well, so it wasnt bland, and it was quite soft as well. The afghani broccoli had a lovely creamy sauce on top, and tasted nice. The soya chaap could have done with a touch more spice. But the star on the plate was the falafel- the fritter was Indian-ized with lovely spices which really made it taste delicious. Veg Mezze Platter: The platter had tabbouleh, labneh, baba ganoush, hummus, falafel, lavaash bread and pita bread. While the baba ganoush had a nice, mild flavour which tasted really nice with the crisp lavaash bread, the tabbouleh could have done with some lemon juice to add a bit of zing to it. The labneh, which is a thick Greek Yogurt, had been mixed with some herbs and rolled into balls, and it tasted amazing. The hummus and pita bread was also divine- the pita bread was thin and toasted, and the hummus was smooth and seasoned perfectly. Gol Gappa Shots: This was also a really interesting dish with shots of vodka-infused spicy panna, topped with crispy gol gappas filled with chickpeas, potatoes, tamarind chutney and green chutney. Next, we moved on to the mains. Aam aadmi Chicken: This dish was presented in a very interesting manner, with the server carrying the tiffin, wrapped in a cloth and tied onto a stick, slung over his shoulder. The dish itself was also very interesting and different- it consisted of a mix of butter chicken, tangy tomatoes, lachcha paranthas, rice and dal. Though it sounds like a mishmash of ingredients, but they all came together to make for a unique and nice tasting dish. The only change we would recommend here is that the lachcha parantha pieces should be cut a bit smaller. Chili Paneer Ghosla: A basket made of noodles, filled with chili paneer cubes, topped with a slice of cheese. The dish looked really beautiful and tasted nice as well. Dynamite Prawn: A really amazing dish- the prawns had been deep-fried and were coated with a really tasty sauce. The combination of the crispy, crunchy prawn with the creamy sauce was really incredible. Ganna Chicken: Really juicy, mildly-spiced chicken mince, coated on a stick of sugarcane, served with a honey-chili dip. A really great dish! Veg and non-veg dimsum with black bean dip: While the dimsum was really well-made, the coating was thin and the fillings were juicy and flavourful, what took these over the edge was the superb black bean dip served alongside. This was one of the best dips weve tasted and is something that should definitely be tried. We then moved on to the next course, desserts, which are a visual spectacle at Unplugged Courtyard. The chef rolled up a trolley and the desserts were created table-side. We tried: UC cake: This cake was created by freezing vanilla and chocolate cakes with liquid nitrogen, and topping it with frozen whipped cream. The most interesting bit is where you have to take a hammer and blast the cake to shards. This cake was high on visual appeal but taste-wise, it was nothing spectacular. Liquid Nitrogen Lollies: Chocolate syrup, kiwi and strawberry crush, are squeezed on a tray which is made super-cold using liquid nitrogen, so that these syrups freeze instantly. This will definitely make you reminisce about your childhood days of enjoying flavoured lollies. Service was quite prompt and though the servers lacked a bit of knowledge about the menu (which is forgivable given that the place is rather new), they were willing to check with the chef and get back to us with the required information. Overall, dining at Unplugged Courtyard not only ensures a great meal, but a wonderful experience as a whole, and is surely recommended! thefeastthatslife.wordpress.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Promila Gujela,"Rated Been there recently to celebrate my birthday with a close friend and it turned out to be superb evening. I was looking to eat the usual Vegetarian North Indian Food but with some interesting interiors. And no doubt , the place lived up to it. The place is near Odeon Cinemas and is huge with a variety of seating in terms of indoor/backyard/rooftop. And each of them has ultimate decor. I sat in the backyard and instantly fell in love with it, its rustic theme and colorful furnishings. They always have some events/live band show going on. That day it was -Jack Daniels with Paper Boat . What was interesting that they had utilized the space under a giant tree with shimmering lights to be their stage and perform there. I wanted to sit at the rooftop first but it was reserved for a private party. But they were generous enough to let me see it and enjoy the view from there as the party had not started yet :p The food was mouth-watering and served hot.

Kartik Bakshi,"Rated I visited this place which had newly opened in Connaught Place. For its launch party which was a great experience. Trust me according to my opinion this place is where you'll be liking to spend your evening in a very pleasant environment. I loved the ambience in UC its hospitality service. Now let me tell you about the appetizers at first we ordered Paneer tikka i found the taste a bit sour due to the topping of green chutney on it but the piece of paneer was soft. Then we ordered the best thing that we tasted never before was the Malai Chicken tikka after having a bite it was damn good by the smokey flavour of tandoor on the outer side and that piece just melted in my mouth. Then we ordered Mutton seekh kabab even that was also great the innercore of it was so soft that i never found till date. Then at last we ordered Spring Rolls it was good in shape n size, crispy with the filling of veggies inside. So overall, I loved the place and soon ill come back to enjoy once again.

Deepti Kumra,"Rated I am very particular when it comes to outdoor seating and there are very few places in Delhi which really know what it truly means. And one of them is undoubtedly the Unplugged Courtyard. Unplugged has an indoor as well as outdoor seating. The indoors are very modern whereas the outdoors are a little raw with wooden furniture and some bright cushions standing out. The ambiance is fantastic and very soothing. A perfect place to chill out with your friends or a dinner date. Food: Every restaurant is nowadays trying to come up with new ways to present their dishes and so did Unplugged but without compromising the taste and quality at all. Dynamite Prawns (5/5)-This dish has become my absolute favorite and I am probably always going to order it whenever I visit this place. Chili Paneer Ghosla (5/5)-I am not a fan of chili paneer at all but this dish impressed me by all means. Some chili paneer in a 'tokri' of fried noodles with a cheese slice was like a perfect combination for me. Courtyard Green Salad (4.5/5)-The salad had lots of green leaves, some cherry tomato, bread crumbs and a perfect seasoning. Steamed Vegetarian Momos (2.5/5)-I don't recommend ordering steamed momos here. Ganna Chicken (4/5)-This dish was again very delectable. Chicken seekh on a sugarcane stick was something I had never tried before. Brownie ke Pakode (4/5)-I loved this dessert. Add loads of whipped cream to brownies and you are all set to enjoy some serious calorie intake! But I didn't regret those calories.. I am definitely going to visit this restaurant super soon and try many other dishes that they have to offer!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Mohit Tyagi,"Rated Made a random plan to visit the most talked about place in town - unplugged courtyard . Rather a beautiful place to unwind , has a nice and groovy terrace which plays music at just the right volume , not too loud ! Pricing is average and well within budget. What i liked was the seating arrangement and friendly staff.what i disliked was the service was extremely slow ( waited 15-20 mins to get my beer refilled ). Coming to the food , i had tandoori momos , which were average , but were served without cutlery , hence i waited for another 10 mins for the plates and forks to show up , rendering the momos cold! .

Nitika Bhatia,"Rated Visited this place for a friend's bachelorette upon a friend's suggestion, and thank god it turned out to be as per our expectations. The ambience is BEAUTIFUL to say the least. The open space with cabanas and trees is like straight from a movie set and is perfect for a brunch or early dinner. We ordered Penne Arabbiata, chicken burger, Veg sandwich and in drinks - Sangria, Mojito and an Aam papad drink. The food was delicious with good portions, but they messed up with my burger as they brought a Veg burger first (while I had ordered a Chicken one). The pasta was nice and so were the fries accompanying our food. The drinks were really nice, especially the Aam papad cocktail. However, one needs to be careful while sitting at the cabanas as flies kept falling in our drinks and we had to get them replaced . But overall I loved the place and had a great time with my friends.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Yamini Gupta,"Rated Heard a lot about this newly opened place in cp, so thought to give it a try on a Saturday evening. So when we entered, we first crossed a dark lane, which leads to the main courtyard in the middle. Though the ambiance was pretty different from the other joints in cp, but I didn't find the place to be happening at all. Despite a lot of people over there, it looked very dull. We seated in the indoors and started to check out the menu. One thing I must mention that the staff over there is just not good. Despite calling the waiters five times, nobody paid heed to us. Finally someone came to take our order. Well we ordered Gol Galauti, Ganna Chicken, Mutton kebabs, chicken biryani and breezers. The food tasted nice but the quantity was very less as compared to the prices we paid. Overall an average experience.",Rated 3.0,3,71,??

Finally after we made a fuss our drinks were served. For food we ordered the Unplugged Chicken which was HORRIBLE. There was also a kids' party and strangely enough, all the waiters were assigned to the kids party. All in all, I'd recommend staying at home.

We ordered a sheeshah, Butter naan murg tikka, Spinach nachos, Maggi momos, Piri piri chicken, and Slow roasted arrabiata mixed sauce pasta. By far it's the best pasta I've had,the maggi momos were fine,rather the dips were better than the dish.

The vintage scooter attracts many eyeballs, the terrace makes one feel ecstatic. The innovative n novice way of presenting food makes one awestruck.

The No Stags policy really sucks. Now that the negatives are out of the way, onto the main points - The place is AMAZING. Right from the entrance passage to the huge courtyard it opens into, everything is amazing. You cannot help but be in awe of the whole vibe of the place. The food is at another level. I've had Biryani in Hyderabad but Unplugged's was better. They had chilli paneer unlike I've ever had, mouthwatering. Must also try their Slow Cooked Arrabiata in Tomato Sauce and their Cocktails.

Akshi Sharma,Rated Last Sunday night it was the second time I had visited Unplugged Courtyard with two friends. This place has a very young and fresh feel. The menu is also quite vast but what I have experienced both the times is that half of the things on the menu are not available. The best thing that I had here was the punjabi falafal. The staff is quite courteous. We had issue with churros and the manager made sure to solve it.

Ridima Agrawal,"Rated This is one of the many new places opening in cp, but what sets it apart is it's ambience. The place looks like a beautiful courtyard with a huge tree in the middle and seating all around it, this definitely makes it worth visiting. Coming to the food ,they have tried to be innovative here as well as mostly its fusion cuisine,where most dishes worked well but some didn't. The things that were delicious were butter chicken tikka, saag nachos, rajma galouti, veg croquettes, aam aadmi chicken and the sangria was good too... However some dishes were a miss like non veg galouti was chewy, soya chaap was bland, satay paneer gravy was a normal paneer butter masala and the most disappointing was the dessert brownie ke pakode which is their specialty and was also recommended by the server, fried brownie with cream was not an appealing combination !

Located besides Odeon, it looked promising. *Ambience : They are spread over a huge space with variety of seating arrangements and atmosphere. The entrance has a dim lighted area with cozy couches for private conversations and a bar with good music playing in the background. The majority of the area is a courtyard having cute lil colourful furniture with greenery all around. Then there is a terrace are with canopy and couches. Perfect for Delhi's winter. Complete 5/5 for the ambience :-) *Food & Drinks : For drinks, we had Cosmopolitan : bland. Not satisfied. 3/5 Classic Mojito : Perfect and soothing. 5/5 Chili Paneer Ghosla : presented with a twist. Tiny chili paneer cubes on fried noodles bed topped with cheese slice. Good and different. Worth a try for vegans. 3.5/5 Pink Sauce Pasta : Disastrous. Half cooked. Disappointed.

Coming to the food, I ordered ""ganna chicken"" & ""chicken shawarma"". Ganna chicken was basically chicken seekh kebab on sugarcane sticks served with honey chilli ginger sauce.

Ankit Kapoor,"Rated The place is highly over rated for no reason. They always say that they don't take reservations stating that they already have 250 tables booked (which is not true coz they don't have that many tables or even overall capacity). This is just a strategy to create fake Hype for their prospective customers. The cocktails were a nightmare, staff is totally clueless as they forget to place the order at the kitchen (happened twice with us), the bill was inflated(for 7 of us the bill amount was 14k and when we drilled into the details it actually turned out to 10k) and many such instances. Food is totally pathetic.. Cold, stale and undercooked. Worst experience ever at CP. Would never recommend this place to anyone. Not to forget the Live music which is totally uncalled for. We should have moved on after placing the first round of drinks and starters but other places were full, which turned out to be Lucky for UC that night.

On a single visit, we were lucky to try both the outdoor seating areas. The decor of the place is different and unique in itself. The courtyard has a lot of greenery, something which is a rare enough to find in cafes in CP. The greenery, sunlight through the greens, a brown scooter in one corner and plenty of great frames for pictures gave the courtyard a summery feel in winters. Coming to the food, we ordered punjabi falafal, pasta, panini with beers. The food tasted decent. The food menu was limited. Service would need a special mention. Though they entertained our request to change our seats when the couple seated next to us started to smoke, the situation occurring in the first place was not acceptable.

Mohit Anand,"Rated We got to hear that a new place has been opened up in the famous street of Connaught place which is already adorned with a multitude of cafes and lounges. Things which I loved : The menu is great and trust me, each and every dish has a unique name and a great description which accompanies the name very well. This place has three different seating areas: inner area which is dimly lit and should be taken if you want some privacy and want to sit near the bar area, outer area which has some really good seats and offer you a splendid view of the tree above this area which is so nicely decorated, and finally the rooftop, which offers you sunshine in this chilly weather. Things which I liked: Drinks like oriental blossom, courtyard signature, kiwi strawberry slush, oreo classic shake were up to the mark. Registani biryani, sab changa chimichanga, grilled cheese panini, courtyard chicken were good and were well garnished on the plates. Things which needs improvement: The service is a vital part of every restaurant and their service was as bad as it could be. I would have rated 4.5 to this place but the service is a part of the total experience and I must say, it hampered our experience to a bit. It seemed that the waiters were not familiar with the dishes listed in the menu and we have to show them every dish in the menu, they couldn't recognize the name. We ordered hukkah which they brought after an hour when our main course was finished, we eventually asked them to cancel it. They gave an excuse that there is a party going on at the rooftop which is why the service is delayed but according to me, you are not providing any discount, so it is your duty that you should provide equal good service to your every customer. Gol gappa hangover was listed in the pizza section and was a total disaster. This dish for 475 bucks is not at all value for money and should be excluded from the menu. If not excluded, then it should be placed in the appetizers section, as you are deceiving the customer by placing it in pizza section. Please consider these points of improvement and you could be one of the best places in th Connaught place area.",Rated 3.5,96,679,??

Nobody was there to take our order after multiple attempts...they served us only with the drinks. They just keep on giving complimentary food.

Pansy Chani,"Rated I was in CP to catch up with an old friend and wanted to explore a new place with some sun in the winters. Found this place on Zomato and it was worth it. Located in the middle circle, the outdoor seating has a usual CP view. And no, one can not really see the flag or the inner circle from there. Though it is very spacious and has a very casual setting to it. We ordered vegetarian food which was average. The drinks could have been better. However, the staff was good enough to replace and get us better drinks later. The best was the UCB Cake that was a dessert. It is a hammered mix of cake, cream, nuts and all the goodness of desserts. It tasted too good! The music was also good and not loud enough, which makes it perfect for a catchup.

The atmosphere was perfect, the right volume to have be bustling and lively but not so loud you couldn't have a chat. We spent a happy few hours here.

Vinni.gandhi93,"Rated So I have waited for nearly 3 weeks to visit this place, and finally yesterday I paid a visite here. The ambience is very pretty. They have a dine in cafe, a courtyard and a terrace. We first sat in the courtyard which is covered by a tall and out spread tree, lanterns hanging on it. Appeing green couches on the sides! And till late evening we shifted to terrace because of flies n mosquitos under the tree. The terrace is beautiful, perfect for a romantic date. So over n all, ambience was impeccable. Coming to the food. I was very unsatisfied. All my excitement was murdered as if. We ordered a butter chicken tikka n paneer khosla which is a very famous dish there. To our surprise they served us food in 5 mins(maybe it was previously cooked or something). The butter chicken tikka was okayish nothing too great. Paneer khosla was raw and cold. They do heat up the stuff from that gun sort of heating machine but that doesn't work much. Paneer khosla is veg dish with the base of crispy noodles or rather a tokri topped with a combination of veggies, panner and cheese. The dish was raw so we asked him to change it and he said you can have something else, then we ordered their unplugged chicken platter with chicken skewers n tangy tangri. The skewers were very average and oily, where as the tangri was good because of the tangy flavour. In drinks we had their signature cold coffee which was good and aam papad caipiroska which a cocktail with vodka n aam papad flavour which was very enlivening. Then as we moved to dessert we ordered their signature ucb cake which they make in front of you with liquid nitrogen. The way they make it is pretty exciting but their isnt much wow factor to the cake. Its a frozen cake basically. I wish I could add the video here for you guys to see how it was made. Over n all, I felt let down by this place because I was excited way too much. 3.5 is because of the ambience.",Rated 3.5,81,89,??

Sachin Bobal,"Rated Unplugged courtyard located in L Block is indeed a very beautiful location for an amazing get together, romantic date or chilling out with friends. It definitely helps you be relaxed for that particular time when you are there. With Terrace area,indoor seating and outdoor seating as well,this place is huge and with variety to choose from. Ordered : Indiana , strawberry and mint smoothie,risotto and unique chicken platter (if I remember the name correctly). Indiana was spicy Aam pans which was great,smoothie was good too. The platter according to my friend was heavenly whereas the risotto was a disappointment. May be the sauce was not good or something,but I didn't like the dish. Overall it's a must go place to have an amazing time.",Rated 4.0,78,494,??
Upasana Sil,"Rated A very nice place to go on any day of the week because of the amazing live music they play. Though the band needs to get changed on important days as they are all amateurs. Apparently, Ali Quli Mirza was in the house to create a lot of noise without any reason to get attention. That could have totally been avoided. There entire menu is still not out yet. Happened to try their Butter Chicken Tikka and Galouti Gol Gol, both of them were decent but the portions were not very great, The service was average and the turnaround time was a little too much than expected. Though Saturdays are usually very crowded and this can be expected. Our Sheesha took an hour to come and by that time it was closing time already.

They have more outdoor seating than indoors and also a variety of it to choose from ranging from sofas, chairs, couches, benches or private enclosures. Quite a lively atmosphere. Coming to food, we ordered the nonveg platter, arrabbiata pasta, juicy chicken burger and mutton rara. The food was great. Tenderly cooked meats and very well balanced flavours. However, the service lagged. We had to wait for about 25 mins for 2 breads! The presentation of food on the plate and quite a few fusion dishes are what makes it stand out. The portions served are of an average quantity and slightly pricey. But the taste, quality and the ambience makes up for it. Limited menu, fancy things.

For gastronomic experience in addition to beautiful decor, amazing presentation and accurate music you shouldn't think twice to give this place a shot. Although few things on their menu are still underway, but whatever ordered were fingerlicious. Pani puri shot is definitely a must!

Its absolutely great in this weather, though i did wonder how they would manage in the cruel summer heat of Delhi. Their drinks were great too...the watermelon Sangria- absolutely amazing. However, we couldnt try anything in the menu cause they had no vegan options. What was hilarious was that the chef of such a huge restaurant in CP did not even know the meaning of the word 'vegan'!! The manager however was extremely courteous and create a veganized mezze platter for us. He seemed genuinely concerned about our meal.

Ankita Ramchandani,"Rated One of the most talked about place in CP, the ambience of this place has done justice to the name itself. The huge neem tree in the middle with pebbles around it gives it a unique look. There are three types of sitting area, one in the inside, the other around the neem tree and one on the terrace. My favourite is the terrace, tbh! There is an open kitchen on the inside which is quite common these days but gives you satisfaction of the food being hygienically prepared. Food: Red bull croquet's: I think that's the name of the dish. Ooooooo! I can still taste those. Simply loved them. They are served with an injection filled with cheeze. *drooling* Chicken masala ticket: again not to sure about the name. Boneless chicken pieces sauted in masala served on square pieces on crisp butter naan and on the side they serve the gravy. I think serving it with mint chutney would be a better option. Next was Alfredo pasta: nicely done pasta in good amount of white sauce. Lacked a bit seasoning but the taste made up to it. Other dishes that I really liked were biryani, golgappa shots,dal makhani and galouti kebabs! For drinks I tried their cranberry mojito- a must try! :)",Rated 5.0,24,44,??
Sukrity Wadhwa,"Rated This is a great place to hangout during winters/good weather because ample amount of open air area. The location seems little off beat but once inside this place you'd feel it was the best decision ever. There's a tree in the middle and they have beautifully decorated it with lighting and Christmas balls. They have these bench style tables that reminded me of the school canteen days. I did not explore their indoor area since the outdoors and terrace was enough to captivate my attention. Initially they couldn't get me a table in time so that had put me off a little but after that their service was on point. The staff us very hospitable. They were on their toes once they sensed my irritation and didn't let lose on a single point after that. Kudos to that! In terms of food, it is good. They have tried to come up with experimental dishes and even succeeded with the taste, I'd say. I had ordered cheese croquettes, sangria and a cocktail. So, with the croquettes they had three different ketchups to offer and all of them were going well with the dish. There a number of sangria options though I picked the one with peach and ginger flavour and it turned out to be a good decision. :) My cocktail was jack daniels based mixed in thick coffee shake (yes doodh+daru ;p) mixed with peanut butter and also had hazelnut shredded in it. The drink was good and pretty strong. And the presentation was damn good. A goblet with tilted glass cup containing the milky cocktail and fumes coming from the bottom of the goblet smelling like coffee. There was some serious Chemistry going on here which I'm not aware of (bkz damn I was ignorant in my chem classes :/ ). Apart from this, they offered me a complimentary dessert which was lollies on the grill. Amazing concept- making lollipops in front of you and serving on the go. They had ice boxes (emitting cold fumes like a freezer) which they said contained liquid nitrogen (again serious chemistry and ignorant me :| ) and as they poured the syrup over these boxes it solidified into a lollipop! x_x sight to watch!!! They have three flavours- chocolate, kiwi and strawberry. My pick- strawberry! So, go try that for sure. Basically, I want to go back to school after going here bkz -: 1. Canteen, benches and recess love 2. Chem revision But since school won't take me back so I'd keep visiting unplugged courtyard for the experience of this kind.

My first reaction when I got there was how did they find a courtyard and such a open space between the buildings of CP. The outdoor ambiance was a very refreshing change from the usual CP places. The small indoor seating was pretty much like any place else. If am going again, i would either opt for the terrace or the courtyard, indoor was too cramped for my taste. The starters were really good. Enjoyed the chicken tikka and the fish. Mutton wrapped on sugarcane was an interesting innovation. In the main course, i liked the red sauce pasta and mutton rogan josh. I will post more reviews on the food in my second visit. Looks like a go to place at the moment.",Rated 4.0,53,454,??

Abhiram Dileep,"Rated I heard really good reviews about this place and so I decided to try unplugged for lunch today. The ambience was really nice but then the food and service was pathetic. The waiters don't know what's on the menu and what's not. Their menu is not structured and they've tried to make it ""cool"" with ridiculous names for dishes. I had a tough time figuring out what's what! I asked the waiter what's their dish ""box-booty fool"" was and he mumbled something like it has something and something (I didn't understand what he said despite asking him thrice to repeat). Finally I gave up and ordered that itself. A minute later another waiter comes up and my friend who joined me also decided to order the same dish (obviously even he didn't understand the menu) and to our surprise this second waiter tells us its not available and finally after him running around here and there and asking other waiters he said it is actually available. Finally when it came it was a burger! I mean what the hell! Why couldn't they just say it's a burger, my friend had even asked if they had any burgers and the waiter said no to him. And a pathetic burger it was. Cold chicken in a bad bun! We had also ordered a gol gappa pizza from their menu and they brought 5 vodka shots and gol gappa! We asked where the pizza was and again they were like this is it! The pastas we ordered were also bad! DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED. WILL NEVER VISIT AGAIN! Oh and dear management at least take the effort to respond to our reviews individually instead of pasting the same response that you've been giving to the previous reviewers!",Rated 1.0,18,65,??
Srj,"Rated Unplugged Courtyard was on my must visit list for quite some time now, and I got to visit this place last night but it did not turn out to be what I had expected... Location: The restaurant is located just behind Odeon cinemas. I had made a prior reservation and asked the staff at the entry about my table to which he promptly replied that yes they had a reservation, and will arrange for a table on the terrace. Once inside, I was asked to wait for my table for 10minutes and that too on the ground floor but it was still fine. The problem was that there was poor coordination between the staff and the management. The staff seemed little untrained, and they openly admitted about the issues citing that the place had just opened. Not a good reason in today's times! Ambience: It is the highlight of Unplugged. The interiors are nice and contemporary but it is the Al fresco and terrace which stands out. The courtyard with the huge tree in the middle is one of the better ones that I have seen, and is the perfect setting for winters. The vintage scooter gives a good look as well. Menu/food: I asked the staff who was attending us for the specialities, and he again casually told me that 'sab waisa hi normal available hai, and kuch World cuisine'. I wanted to try a lot of things but was put off by the response. I asked for pizzas, and grills which were not available just like some other dishes too. The menu is limited and on top of it if you don't have dishes then thats a bummer. So, I ordered a veg lal dora di manjee which was basically a veg platter which had punjabi falafel, paneer tikka, tandoori broccoli, and a seekh kebab. The dish was brought in 5-10 minutes which was good but what was not was the fact that everything was cold and the taste did not leave anything to desire. We also ordered for a black forest risotto, and it was cooked just fine and had nice seasoning but had lots of oil in it. The only standout in a way was the Oriental bloom mocktail which had kaffir in it, and taste amazing and the dessert, Lollies Antigrill and that too just for the show of liquid Nitrogen which is used to make the chocolate, strawberry, kiwi lollypops right in front of you from scratch. The taste was average. The staff was helpful and courteous but quite untrained. Different staff members kept coming to the table with orders we didn't order. Honestly, I am really disappointed as I had huge expectations from this place.

Her Little Cookbook,Rated I visited this Unplugged Courtyard for its launch organised for foodies. So if I should rate this place only based on the food we were served my rating would be 1. During 3 hours I spent there I had an opportunity to try only 3 starters (even though we were continously asking for new ones) which were veeery average (I don't remember their names and we were not provided with the list of the dish names). Around 11PM everyone were served dinner from a buffet which was next disappointment. I had to keep ordering drinks 3-5 times to get it because waiters were too busy or were forgeting my order (the fastest way was to go and get it on my own from the bar). My rating 3 is only thanks to an amazing ambience which this place has and thanks to which I may consider going back there. If it would be a regular launch I wouldn't complain.

However my experience was kind of a let down since firstly we were told to wait since there was no seating available inside whereas as we went inside the place was almost empty! That's a bummer. Secondly, whichever item we wanted to order was not being served yet. On expressing the same to the manager, he told us that we are waiting for some equipments to arrive and then we shall start in full swing. My only concern - start when you are fully ready. Because it's definitely a let down when the food listed on the menu is not available (that too when the prices of this place are quite high) Anyway, we only ordered 2 dishes - Mezze platter and a veg Spring roll (presentation was not good and the food was cold) We did express our dissatisfaction to the management to which he was kind enough to offer us their star dish - live lollipop making which was available in 3 flavours Kiwi, Chocolate, and Strawberry.

The courtyard is the best place to sit during winters to soak in ample amount of Vitamin D. The old school vibe of Unplugged really gives a kick. The food is quite yummy and is presented very well in quirky platters. The Galouti kebabs,the nachos,pastas,etc. are seasoned very well. My favorite drinks here : Kiwi Slush : The ombre colored layered kiwi slush tastes heavenly. Just the right zing! White Wine Sangria : Not the 'usual' sangria! I love the fruity essence in the sangria. Apple Crumble Shake : This literally tastes like an apple crumble. I really want to decode the recipe. The flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg really amp up the game. Dessert : I tried Brownie ke pakode! This fusion was quite risky to try,but it turned out to be good. A videshi dessert with the desi twist.

Kiran Negi,"Rated I happen to visit this restaurant lately and I was in awe with this place. The decor and the ambience justifies the name Unplugged Courtyard. The soothing country music and beautiful interiors adds to it. The food and drinks are much different and also takes the molecular gastronomy to a different level. Tried a few dishes like the Rajma Chawal Galouti, the Croquette's, along with the 3 cheese Risotto, and the slow cooked pasta, the food gets a big thumbs up from me, and the presentation of food is second to none. The Nutty Jack happens to be the crowd's favourite, a nice blend of Vanilla and Jack Daniels, a must try for anyone liking alcohol and willing to try something new and different.

WhenIAte,"Rated Food: 4.0 Service: (-1) Ambiance: 4.5 Another one of those fusion places on the lines of Farzi Cafe.

However, when we went last Saturday, half of the options were not available in the menu including all pizzas and dumplings. Even when the waiting staff recommended a few options, later they were found unavailable. The waiting staff was probably the worst I have seen in such upmarket places. Didnt even serve water, brought breads way before curries and what not. Thankfully the food that finally arrived (in random order) was above average but one just cannot enjoy things served at 15 minute intervals. And this when the place was only 60% occupied. Get your act together people if you want this place to do well. What to order: The paneer satay curry (one of the best I have had), chicken ganna kebab and the Punjabi falafels. wheniate.com",Rated 2.5,26,150,??
Sachin Sahni,"Rated I think you all must be great food lovers which is the reason that you're reading this review of mine. And, definitely as you're food lovers then for you the restaurants, ambiance, location matters the most as well if I am not wrong and as its winter season then there is nothing better than a rooftop restaurant for all of you out there, isn't it? But, have you ever been to a place in Delhi/NCR where you good find a legendary courtyard which is open from all sides, amazingly Sun kissed, with beautiful sitting area across and with a main highlight as a tall tree standing tall in between where all the great performers of Delhi/NCR perform under its shade including big Bollywood stars like, Shahrukh Khan, Kajol & Varun Dhawan visit and perform? I don't think so! Yes, I am talking about a place that recently became my favourite too. I know that you must be thinking that being a food blogger I might be writing Biased review under anyone's pressure or influence but, I want all of you who wants to contradict my statement to visit the restaurant and experience the truth yourself. The best part is that these guys have an inside seating space, a grand and a beautiful courtyard & an amazing rooftop too. All under one roof with amazing food option which makes this place a perfect hangout place in Delhi/NCR to chillout in winters so far as I am not aware how is it going to perform in summers and in unpredictable Delhi rainy weather but, I am so sure that they will come up with something for sure for the same. Talking about the food I had loads of options over food as I was one of those lucky bloggers who got an invitation for their Pre-Launch event too. Will be sharing some of the best experiences over food for sure but really not so sure that where to start from as every food item for me from the menu was just perfect starting from their drinks to their appetizers, main course and ending with the desserts. Everything is very good here. To be very true, it is very difficult to get 5 out of 5 stars when it comes to food and ambiance or shall I say overall experience? But, the fact is that this restaurant has definitely impressed me a lot. to start with I will talk about their drinks. I had some of their best and signature drinks that were very tasty and some of my favorites were as follows : * Strawberry Kiwi Slush : This was a layered slush drink. As soon as it is served to you, you can see two different colors and taste layered very carefully and cleverly on each other and is definitely a heart winner! * The Nutty Jack : As soon as this drink will be presented in front of you, you will be very astonished to see how it is served weirdly. Weird in sense (starting from the bottom) First you will see a glass saucer and on it there will be a beautiful thick wine glass and inside the wine glass you will see another coffee glass in which you will find your cocktail, which looks like a coffee but is not and is actually Jack Daniels & Coffee based cocktail and on its side you will find a spoon full of peanut butter! Crazy! Isn't it? But trust me guys its taste is more crazier that what you are expecting and it is one of the best and a must try cocktails in Unplugged Courtyard (This drink was not at the Pre - Launch party but was only available after restaurant was open for general public). * Rozy : This Cocktail was pomegranate flavoured and was vodka based i think and was also beautifully and crazily served inside the lantern and that was something made my day of the Christmas when I decided to visit them for this amazing Lunch! There were some more amazing drinks that I had like Gardeno which was like a more of a spice based cocktail as well as there was also a milk based cocktail named as apple crumble sake and I aslo tried their Indian seasonal shots which was Aam Panna Flavoured shot! Food : I was so stuffed already with damn exciting varieties of their drinks that I decided to have few selected choices of food. The best of them that I tried were, * Unplugged Chicken : Which was more of a kind of a platter where I got to have varieties of meats in the form of lamb, pork sausages, Chicken lollypops etc, and was totally good to have. * Bangers & Mash : This was a bit different version of Bangers & Mash that I had so far as I had typically you get Pork sausages made in some kind of sauce with potato mash on the side but here what I had was Bacon Wrapped sausages with flavoured potato mash which was actually out of the world and was giving all together new dimension to it! * Dynamite Prawns : This is one of the dishes that I could not stop myself explaining here as it was actually totally new version of cocktail prawn that I have ever had in my life as these were mildly spiced when you will have a first bite but suddenly you will start realizing a fact that it is actually have started burning your throat altogether and you will definitely need water to quench that itchiness of your throat. There were few special dishes that I had were like, Butter chicken tikka which was butter chicken sauce marinated Tikka's served with Butter Chicken sauce folowed by, Galouti, Naachos makki and sarson dance & Original recipe Tangdi which was killer to have and trust me that this was the first time ever I have had such awesomely tasting Tangdi! Desert : Dessert part was totally different as it was simple yet a unique experience for a person visiting the restaurant as they do this molecular lollypops which they make in front of you on a cold plate and it is very crazy to see how a normal liquid turns into a solidified lollypop in front of your eyes in just few seconds and on top of that it was delicious to have as well. Something unique yet delicious. My Rating : 5 out of 5 without a single thought and straight away going in my favorite list!

Sinchita Kar,"Rated I was lucky to have joined for the exclusive preview and I loved each and everything! Firstly, it's a beautiful place. Set in a crowded CP, it travels you back to a place where the city doesn't trouble you rather helps you relax. The huge tree in the middle of the courtyard with the small lamps hanging help set the mood. Additionally, it's called unplugged because jazz music is played in the background! I tried some of the dishes but my favourites were: SPAGHETTI MEATBALLS: the chicken meatballs were superbly flavourful with that Rosemary flavour. GALOUTI KEBAB: melted in my mouth! Too good! WHITE WINE SANGRIA: I loved pomegranates were added making it very flavourful. It was innovative and different!

Mudit Bhargava,"Rated A story of rude service ... I can't believe this place is rated 4.5. What is it for?Uncomfortable chairs? Or for a menu, on which many dishes are unavailable (believe me 2 pages of the menu were unavailable). Also, where do you need to give your name and phone number before you enter a restaurant (no waiting period)? I asked for a terrace seat, but all the best seats were reserved. All right, no issues; I found one downstairs. The waiters kept bothering me every 5 minutes to order something. When I asked for some time, they ultimately told me - ""Sir, this seat is reserved. If you need time, please make yourself comfortable upstairs"". WTF! I went upstairs first, and you didn't have any seats, apart from those uncomfortable stool chairs!

This one being located near big cinemas-odean, middle circle covers huge space, with different locations to sit inside and outside, so indoor is also amazing and outdoor is also amazing. However, the starters were fine but the main course was not that amazing, it was not bad though, but not as expected.

Sonali Rastogi,"Rated One of the saddest experience here. One over enthusiastic server who kept nodding to everything but didn't do anything. Very limited menu, especially for vegeterians, and out of that 50% of the things weren't available. No Bira, No draught beer, no bloody mary!! Then no pizzas. No garlic breadsticks. Ordered chilli paneer ghosla, though an innovative dish was super duper sweet. Ordered mutton seekh which took 25 minutes. Thats fine, but while the waiter was keeping it at the table, a piece rolled out of the platter, straight at the dirty table. When asked for removing that and getting another platter, we were served it in 2 minutes. Obviously they gave us the same plate with the rolled off piece on it.

Meenakshi,"Rated Tried this place recently and would say it's decent but a bit overpriced for the quality they provide. We had chilli paneer ghosla which was nicely made and the presentation was cute , also we had galoti gol gol kebab and please note kebabs are not made like this next we ordered chicken biryani which was too high on flavors and white sauce pasta in which sauce was nice and consistent but lack flavor. The experience was good cz I had great company and the ambience is also fine but can be made better and the food definitely needs a kick. Being in cp when you have to compete with a lot of great outlets you just can't price your stuff at their rate but have to make them worth as well.

Upon arrival we were quickly escorted to our table, which wasn't an issue. I asked if it was still the cabana and was told it was. We were shown to our table which had a perfect view, much to my friend's delight! The minute you walk in your are treated as a valued patron. We started with a drink in the garden bar ,lovely Christmas dcor and ambience. Were seated at the cabana and the service which followed was impeccable!

Neha R. Sood,"Rated Very rarely you find a boulevard in hustle of central Delhi and that as well in Connaught Place. A job well done by my dear friend Mister Tikku and Swaraj Singh who have nailed it right from identifying the property or coming up with interiors, well chosen menus, service staff and not to forget the pricing. Unfortunately could not attend the launch party since I was out of town but the very moment I was back in town, wanted to check out this place. It is in L block, in the alley and for those not familiar with CP at all could get lost the first time around. Open place, open house, great music and spirits which just crawls up your skin in no time. Review: Good: The food was good and so were the offering from the bar. The service was also very fast and the best part is - it is totally worth it. The nachos were supremely awesome. Served hot and served well The dal and naan were also very good. The naan was served hot which is how it should be. The mutton biryani was also very well done. Try out the Aam Aadmi chicken and ganna chicken as chef choice. Bad: Lot of things we wanted to order from the menu weren't available. May be it was an off day. Paneer ka ghosla is tad over rated for a vegetarian , but very well thought of and presented. It has cubes of paneer which is served on crisp noodle basket and topped with melting cheese. When you indulge in it, you would find it to be very sweet and bland if you are trying to munch it along noodles. Food - 4/5 Ambiance - 4.5/5 Service - 4.5/5 Value for money - 5/5 Bartender & DJ - 4.5/5 The mocktail and drinks were made very well so I guess someone noteworthy is standing behind the bar and mixing up those spirits very well. Well a long way to go but definitely a good start. P.S: I don't know if it hurts to add couple of soups (good to have in chilly weather) All the above review doesn't add up to 4 but don't want to make it sound unrealistic and totally organic review.",Rated 4.0,68,398,??

But we were in for a shock when we saw the menu. There are hardly any dishes that they serve. Limited menu. They don't have beer pitchers and the alcohol menu was also very limited. Being a new place I was expecting the opposite. Nevertheless the food was good, we tried everything on the veg menu (6dishes in total) and I can say it was decent enough. The ambience makes up for the drawbacks. They do serve their spirits in some fancy ""laaltein"".

Kamal Arora,"Rated When you enter UC and take a look around you'll understand why its called courtyard. They have ample open space and the ground level part is nicely done with detail. It almost recreates a garden like surrounding. After taking a very comfortable seat at a Cabana we started to have a look around the menu. Our attendant and server Ashok was on his toes throughout. He proactively suggested what we should order as the menu appeared really interesting and made us a little indecisive! For appetisers we went ahead with 'Ganna Chicken' which I make recommendation for anyone who visits UC as it was a very innovative and different dish that I've tried in a long time. It was minced chicken wrapped around a sugarcane stick. This tasted superbly well with the dip they served along with it. For mains we ordered a chicken arrabbiata pasta. Which I felt could have a little bit more bite to it. In the beverages menu their signature cocktails caught my maximum attention and I knew I wanted to try the same. I tried their Saffron and Sandalwood martini which again is my recommendation. This drink was like having a pious and holy water in a temple which just some tequila in it. (A R-rated drink for your soul *wink*wink*). My friend went ahead with a rum and pomegranate drink whose presentation and taste were both amazing. We enjoyed our drinks at the terrace upstairs basking in the sun and making most of a Delhi winters' afternoon. To finish of our UC experience the chef offered us ""live"" desserts. He made ice lollypops for us on an ice grill known as Taipan. I absolutely loved spending my afternoon at Unplugged and with such beautiful open sitting area they have brought garden dining experience like at Olive/Fio more closer to the heart of Delhi.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

To start with the ambience the outdoor sitting and just about the entire place has an amazing feel to it . Its huge and very well made . Starting with the food , since this outlet is just recently started and with the amount of people coming in you could say there service was disappointing . So not such a great start , however they made up for it . And yes good things do take time . The food was amazingly well presented and tasted extremely good . Since they were late with their order they pretty much made up by giving us complementary mocktails and 2 dishes . The owner was brilliantly sweet and handled everything perfectly . The price of everything is also decent enough . The full menu isnt up yet but they shall start with it in another few days . All i can say is i am recommending this place to all my friends and will surely be a frequent visitor here . I completely understand that it is extremely new so things will take some time to settle.

Very friendly staff and efficient service. Coming to food love their presentation and the food is tasty. The food worth mentioning is chicken tikka which was served on bites of bread, soya champ was surprisingly awesome (me being a strict meat person) , their chicken seekh kebabs ate served on small sugarcane sticks and you get an awesome sweet and salted taste.

Now coming to the deserts we loved the nitrogen frozen lollies and their brownies were one of the finest we have had( soft and just yumm).... Special word goes to their service which was spot on.

This place is suitable for anything, party, dining, hang-out with drinks, some gup-shup over good food and amazing ambiance. First of all, the place. The Courtyard in the name is not just for the sake of it. This place has a perfect courtyard, with a huge neem tree providing shade from all the negativity. Then the inner seating arrangement is nice with the bar in front and the kitchen beside. There is also a terrace space if you want to have a private time under the stars on a clear night.

They would cooperate with you at every stage so that you are comfortable. Now, the food and beverages. The food is smashing. The vegetarian dishes are scrumptious and would melt the hearts of even a non-vegetarian. The non-vegetarian dishes are great as well, especially the chicken tikka, it is perfect.

The decor and upholstery is very defined, more of a personal style statement of Dinesh Arora. The most surprising part of the event was bhar pet variety and quantity of main course. I had never expected a main course as launches are generally drinks and finger food. The Dal Makhani was rich and heavenly, I would rate it at par with that served at Gulati. There was panner, chicken, pasta, chocolate mousse part of the spread laid around the banyan tree. Each food item was bang on flavours and taste. I still crave for the Dal though !!

Been there twice already and well iev tried out most of the vegetarian options, starters, main course (which i forgot to take photos of because i was too busy hogging), drinks and dessert. Food is excellent and served at the right pace, the staff here is to be commended for being sweet and accommodating. Was there last night for the christmas eve celebration there was a lot of variety and the food kept coming. Special thanks to the Owner who went all out on the packages, for food, alcohol and sheesha which to my surprise was on the house for evening. All and all i had a great time with my friends over drinks and buffet dinner which i think was a fab idea for Christmas! Also, complimentary brownies for everyone, almost as if the gift kept on coming so sweet. Thank you Unplugged team, Merry Christmas and keep the good work going !",Rated 4.5,2,92,??
The Wanderlust Foodies,"Rated What do say about this place now. Need to party? Need to have a calm evening? Need to have a nice dinner with family or friends? Need to just hang out with drinks? This place is perfect for anything. The courtyard itself with the cadaverous Neem Tree in the middle provides a serenity and the little decorations like a cycle with basket of flowers, post box, etc. help in enhancing the already great ambiance. The inner seating arrangement is a warm and cozy place with the bar in the front so you can see your drinks being prepared. The staff is courteous and cooperative. Now, for the food part. There is not a thing wrong here. The food here will not disappoint at all, be it vegetarian or non-vegetarian. Every dish is fresh and full of good flavors.

Mansi Ahuja,"Rated Nothing can please you after a hectic day at work than a good place, finger licking food and amazing music. Unplugged Courtyard, located in CP is surely a place to be, specially in winter. The tree placed in the middle of this restaurant will keep you at bay from that noisy car horns, and will keep you close to the nature. They also offer open terrace and one can organize private parties for their special loved ones. What attracts me the most is the ambience and this place is very well crafted with beautiful lights, plush seating, and offers peace to their guests. So, those who love nature and calm places, Unplugged Courtyard should be in your list. Talking about food, I loved everything I tried. I started my gastronomical journey with a mocktail, to accompany the drink I ordered some snacks for my friends. The food was so delicious that we forgot to take some clicks. Pizza and Pasta is a must try. I loved the main course, being a Punjabi I can not resist Dal Makhni and Butter Chicken, that is what we ordered. Wonderful Location, Amazing Music, Scrumptious Food, Good Service, Humble staff, in all its a good package for a nice evening or for sunday brunch with your beau. You never know your guy/girl will fall in love with you again for the beautiful date at Unplugged Courtyard. As the same happened with me ;)",Rated 4.5,3,48,??
Nitin Kapoor,"Rated Romantic settings cannot get over-the-top than this! You enter through a well-lit alley where spot lights lead you to a cobblestone courtyard with brick clad walls all around. What takes things to the next level is the lavish ambiance and the assuredness of the menu that has brilliantly done up in courtyard, Ranch style and massive terrace. This finely done up restaurant is a must visit for those who prefer peace and quiet yet over the weekends it turns to a party hot spot in CP. Beautifully crafted lights in the open, cabanas in courtyard and plush seating - all add to the already romantic vibe. For a more private experience, you can skip the communal table and head for one of the Cabanas. Western classical is the choice of music while they serve Modern Indian cuisine, Pizzaria(to be operational soon) and BBQ Grill where you can buy by weight(yes you read it right). Gaana Chicken, Aam Admi Chicken, kuan dhuan, sab changa burritos and many more favourites in just one visit Excellent location, magnificent ambiance, impeccable service and irresistible food make this restaurant a winner in every category! A meal here isnt too expensive, but if youre looking forward to a special occasion, this place is hard to better.",Rated 5.0,11,430,??

Shehnaz Paras,"Rated Four of us came here for lunch and I must say it was a fantastic experience. The staff were extremely polite and attentive. We began our lunch with a drink at the downstairs bar, and then made our way up to the restaurant about an hour later. The Ganna Chicken was the best steak I have ever had and I am a very fussy eater! The cocktails were fab, the food was fab, and the service was fab. At the end of our meal, the Brand manager, Mr.Sauarv, came round to find out how our meal was what a nice touch! We were also celebrating a birthday, so they came round with some chocolates ice lolies for her which was a lovely touch.

In the hustle bustle of Connaught Place, you will rarely find a place with a tree in the court itself that too huge..

Apaarastogi1993,"Rated Situated in the by lane of a really busy and popular Odeon Cinema is Unplugged Courtyard, the name itself gives an insight of what to expect, it has a beautiful courtyard area, with a neem tree in the middle, which itself gives you a very soothing feel. Adding to it, it has a huge terrace and a very rustic yet classy indoor area, the bar itself is very different, a common one for both the courtyard as well as the indoor area. The music is nice, a good combination of both commercial and unplugged, to compliment it's name. It also organises live gigs, and bands, as could be seen on the bloggers meet, where a Jazz Singer was seen performing. The food and drinks are exquisite, a good variety of Indian and International flavours. What to try : Ganna Chicken, Soya Malai Chaap, Bangers and Bash, Balls and more, Nalli Talli and the Dal Makhani, something that appeals to everyone. The food is good and has some excellent flavours, and second to none in quality and quantity. It also has an open kitchen, so you can have a look on what's going on and what a professional kitchen looks, which not many get a chance to experience. The decor is laid back, gives you a nice relaxing feel, and makes you feel comfortable which excites and entices you to come here more often. The staff is friendly and soft spoken, open to ideas and complaints and queries, if any. This is a place, not only about food and drinks, but about experience. Experience that was hard to get in a place like Delhi till this place was brought up. A must visit place in CP where you'll be more than welcome.",Rated 5.0,2,2,??

Gurpreet Singh Tikku,"Rated Some Places are named so apt ki aisa lagta hai ki pehle jagah banayi gayi, uski feel li gayi, aur fir naam rakha gaya. Unplugged unplugs you from all your worries. The moment you enter Unplugged you are greeted with rugged Interiors in Browns as if you are entering Mexicos Countryside Tavern where time has stopped moving. A Place where people come to not only eat but also meet. The friendly staff seems to have taken the ownership of the restaurant as they treat you as if its their own venture. I think this kind of service only comes top down from the owners. #UnlockUnplugged #MisterTikku The Food here is great, every thing we tried that rolled out of the kitchen was not only amazing in the way it tasted but also in the way it was presented. Even If you are not a Food Enthusiast, you will take out your phone cameras & Click a pic for keeps. Have to mention that the quantity is great and the Ingredients they add best available. One can notice that in every bite. As you enter the courtyard you get a feeling ki aap Dilli ke CP mein to ho hi nahi. Itna barra itna sunehra aangan to Daadi ki kahaniyon mein hi suna hai. Bas samjho waisa hi hai.. barra saa aangan, Beech mein barra sa chhaya daar per. There is something in the place that makes it tough for you to move out. Apart from the awesome courtyard they also have a huge terrace where one can have private parties away from the prying eyes of people on next table and by the way terrace has a separate Bar area so that there is no Slip between your drink and your Lip :-) All in All, an amazing place to spend an Evening or an Afternoon with close friends or even alone while soaking the Positive vibes around. I will be seen here quite often and if you see a Men in Red Turban do not hesitate to ask if its MisterTikku. Would love to have a drink together :-)",Rated 5.0,7,624,??

Shagun Raizada (Myfoodproject.org),"Rated The place to go to In CP! I am so glad this happened to CP as it was much needed. Unplugged opened recently with a big bang and a lot of hype and I was lucky to be a part of it. The moment I entered the place I was floored by the sheer size and ambiance of the place! You enter into an indoor section with a bar and DJ console. Moving forward you will see a door leading to an open space and this place will transport you to GOA! Dine under a huge tree in the center. Cute low tables in the center with floral upholstery and some high wooden table along the wall (see pics). The indoor portion is a bar area with wooden interiors and maroon upholstery. First floor has a beautiful terrace. Drank some Red Wine Sangria and Vodka based cocktail. Both were great! Ate some Indian food at Unplugged and loved it!! I had a Mutton Rogan Gosh in brown curry which was delectable. Mutton was well cooked and soft. Chicken Curry was yum and flavoury. Paranthas and other breads were crisp and good.

Priyanshu Kumar,"Rated Planning for a happening place in capital for partying. Here it is, the new buzz and most talked about place these days. It opened with a bang. A lavish party was organised and was attended by some renowned names of varied fields, bloggers etc. The grand event had a special cocktail and food menu tasting session on the day. The place has got lovely outdoor seating and a lovely open terrace seating, apart from the varied indoor seating options. They have got nice couches, comfy sofas, high seting tables and chairs etc. They have a nice big open bar and open kitchen. The place has got nice rustic feel and touch to it as well. They have got a nice big antique clock, wooden walls, empty beer bottles, chains, saddles etc as their decor all over. I was invited being an active food blogger on various platforms and was representing my bloggers community. The place on the opening day saw a huge gathering in the meet up, which numbered around 450 - 500 people as per my assumption. The staffs and service, I would say was good and prompt, looking at the huge numbers they were attending. coming onto the food : I had Chicken skewers, mutton seekh kebab, mushroom chilli, palak paneer tikka, chicken tikka, veg cigars, which were great at taste. Mutton seekh kebab and chicken skewers being the best and must try here. Mushroom could have been more nicer, if it was cooked properly, it was 3/4th done. Palak paneer tikka was slightly raw, the grinding of the green element in a better way could have added more taste to the particular dish. Moving on to the main course - They have got a circular chowpati type structure in mid of their outdoor seating which they converted into a buffet arrangement area for food. I had tandoori roti, steamed rice, fied rice, mutton rara, butter chicken, dal makhni, pasta and salad. Butter chicken and mutton rara being the best. As they were great at taste and cooked with perfection. Drinks were great. I had many, Rum, Vodka shots, Red wine sangria, & a few mocktails and beer. This place will be one of its kind for party lovers, as well as for someone who wanna enjoy a nice open terrace dining with some nice cocktails amidst of the busy citylife. I would definitely be coming sooner to the place once its officially launched & open for the general public.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
