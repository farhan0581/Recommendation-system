Ginni Kaur,"Rated My 1st visit to their Connaught place. have tried the butterfly chicken and the chicken ceasar wrap.. The wrap was absolutely delicious!. The taste is great, service is good.",Rated 4.0,5,0,??
Samrat Chakravorty,"Rated Wonderful place with good ambience and great food. While waiting for friends to join i started with half flame grilled peri peri chicken and a glass of draught beer. Was delighted to see by half chicken they literally meant one half of a whole bird. It was quite a feast. The chicken extremely tender and well grilled. As friends began to join we soon moved from glasses to pitchers with sides of fries. I wanted to try the Portuguese style espetada carnival, tender chicken thighs grilled and served with capsicas and onions on a skewer hanging downwards. The preparation was amazing and portions again quite good. Only complaint we had was, that even though we tried the hot/extra hot preparation and sauce, it did not feel spicy at all. And its not just one man opinion, generally every one at the table felt so. So it would be really wonderful if you guys can actually turn the heat on a bit when someone especially asks for food to be extra hot. Particularly enjoyed the music too. Though i could not make out the tracks, but it was adding a wonderful african tribal beats to the ambience. Had a wonderful evening and would love to come back again.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Foodie,Rated So it's Valentine day. My first love and last love is food been there again. Love this place nicest simplest non-veg cuisine. Peri peri sausage will really hit your taste bud.

Jasmeet Kaur Kang,Rated My first experience with non vegetarian food that turned out to be pretty awesome! A perfect ambience with the blend of African music that gives you a really good vibe! Food tasted good! Quantity was perfect.. The addition of Peri peri sauce adds up to the taste! Definitely a good place to hang out with friends! Thumbs up!!!,Rated 3.5,7,4,??

Saurabh Gupta,"Rated It serves one of the best offbeat cusines... I love the classic peri peri chicken, and the different flavor of sauces will spoil you for choice... The place has only one issue, the taste is the same for most of the dishes, so if you might get bored of the place in just a few visits... But a must have for all the chicken lovers....",Rated 4.0,11,11,??
Praneet Singh,"Rated Well I had heard a lot about the Nando's peri peri grilled chicken but didn't get a chance to visit the outlet since very long, though I'm a big foodie and NV lover. The place is well made and you see the live big grill on which they make you the 'ever-so-famous' peri peri chicken. The peri peri chicken were huge(full leg I.e leg + thigh) pieces of perfectly grilled and tender till the bone. The chicken was well prepared and just the right amount of spices and juicy till the end. Well a hot n sweet dip/sauce would have up'd the experience. No complaints, a must try and visit place.",Rated 4.0,2,1,??
Meghna Jha,Rated Well .. If you are a non veg lover .. This is exactly the place where you should be and have loads of Peri peri chicken . All the dishes we ordered were too good . Felt all full just after half chicken . Planning to visit there soon .,Rated 3.5,34,116,??
Gurinder Pal Singh,Rated My 1st visit to their Connaught place outlet ambience is little dull as compared to vasnt kunj / Gurgaon food is as usual goodgood service our order was served hot and on time.

Arnav Das,Rated So I went here a few days back - Sunday early evening at around 7:30PM. Ambience - keeping with regular Nandos interiors. Wooden feel. Though I think upstairs is a little cramped (not as spread out as their VK outlet) The food is pretty standardized - nothing out of the world but exactly what you expect from Nandos. What I love about Nandos as compared to similar eateries is that they let you try all the sauces regardless of what you order. I am not a spicy food lover and hence I ordered the lemon and herb spice level (which is basically no chilli at all!) and tried the other sauces seperately with my dish. The bottomless Coke is a good concept; wish it was there in more such places. And so are their corn-on-cob and coleslaw which help to moderate the spice and oil. Next up I want to try their skewers - observed nearby tables being served and it looked really good! Budget is reasonable; well within expectations.,Rated 4.0,9,3,??
Simran Kaur Arora,"Rated Nando's is sucha cool place to be! It's buzzing with people ( We had to wait for about 5 minutes for a table) ,with some energetic African music playing, and a lively ambience. Spread over the ground and first floor, it has got comfy seating options. We ordered a FULL PLATTER, that included one whole PERI PERI CHICKEN, with PERI CHIPS ( the usual fries), GARLIC BREAD and COLESLAW as sides. The chicken was tender and had the perfect blend of flavours. It was absolutely filling, and can be shared by around 3 persons. Also the BOTTOMLESS Soft Drinks! The staff and service were great as well. I am definitely going back for more!",Rated 5.0,10,32,??
Faisal Saiyed,"Rated Finally visited the place in India..had ordered peri peri chicken (Mild).the skin and the spice level of peri peri was perfect but it was a bit dry and chewy inside. The espetada was soft,juicy and yummilicious. The ambience is at par to all Nando's outlets in the middle east.The staff was decent. The best part of this place is the special unique sauce in the fancy bottle Overall a brilliant experience and would visit the place again really soon",Rated 4.0,27,151,??

Vaishali,"Rated Visited this outlet for the first time and their service is as good as always... We ordered Rosa fresca, refreshermint and citrus bliss..must say the designer drinks were amazing... We had the peri peri chicken which was quite good though I was highly disappointed with paneer wrap and veg espetada... And the worst part of the meal was garlic bread... As much as I enjoyed the chicken and drinks, the rest of the meal was a let down... Service: 3.5/5 Food: 3/5 Ambience: 2.5/5",Rated 3.0,24,26,??
Malapaka Srikanth Sharma,"Rated Wanted to try out this place for a long time now, finally landed there last weekend. Decor is simple and nice, seating is good. The view is great. They play this unique (probably African) music, which was kinda good. The paintings on the wall are pretty good. Ordered hummus with peri-peri sauce, roasted veggie wrap with three bean salad, a citrus blast and a carrot cake. hummus with peri-peri sauce is all the more good because of the peri-peri sauce. three bean salad is okayish. roasted veggie wrap was good. Their designer drink and dessert were absolutely out of the world. Top class stuff there. Waiters were fairly helpful, but could have been a wee-bit more attentive. They have this special signature dish on the menu called 'halla bowl', they keep shouting the name of the dish whenever someone orders it or something, that was good!! Must visit, definitely recommended!!",Rated 4.0,55,390,??
Shaili Guha,"Rated Nando's finally! It was my first time in Nando's that I got a place in a jiffy.... (yay!) Ordered Grilled Chicken Cataplana Algarve Salad Ice Tea Rosa Fresca GRILLED CHICKEN CATAPLANA- It was served in a copper utensil, with rice, zucchini, chicken and other veggies. Taste was very good. A great meal for two. ALGARVE SALAD- It was the best of all I had here in Nando's. A very delicious and nutritious meal. A variety of leaves served with sundried tomato, peppers, chicken and feta cheese. It was heaven! ICE TEA- Tasted as usual, it was good. ROSA FRESCA- Got as a complimentary drink with Cataplana and it was a sexy drink! It had a fresh mint flavour with pomegranate and lime taste. Was fantastic! Enjoyed thoroughly!!

Dr Vishal Agrawal,Rated Amazing food very courteous staff. Their grilled peri peri chicken is to die for. Garlic bread is must try in sides!! With beer your food might just taste better. A good hangout.,Rated 4.0,49,68,??
Bitan Banerjee,"Rated Nando's has been one of my favourite restaurant since from 2009. I first dined in this chain in Nottingham, UK. I fell in love with the food. In India, I went to Nando's at Connaught Place, and talking turkey, the taste was almost identical here. We ordered the Whole Chicken Platter, and it tasted......hmmm....whats the word am looking for...""DELICIOUS"". Anyone who likes Portuguese cuisine should go here.",Rated 4.5,56,182,??
Omurice Lover,"Rated Had heard a lot about Nando's and decided to give it a shot one day in CP. I was surprised to see the nice decor as I walked it, because I had heard about it as a ""chain"" restaurant on the internet, and I have fairly average expectations of chains. Well I don't know how Nando's outlets in other countries look like, but the one in CP was certainly well done, and the decor gave me a feeling of comfort. There weren't many people the day we visited, so my friend and I could have a nice long private chat without being disturbed. We had a black coffee and green tea, and a chicken wrap with grilled veggies and Portuguese salad. The food was decent, felt healthy and then peri peri sauces were nice and tangy (there are multiple ""levels"" of spiciness). We were here for a long time, and it was quite and enjoyable experience - but it may be quite different at peak hours. I wouldn't take the food to be authentic south African food, but more like fusion food drawing south African and Portuguese inspiration, so I don't want to complain on this aspect. I will definitely visit Nando's again to try out other stuff on the menu.",Rated 3.5,32,21,??
CurtistheWalrus,"Rated It's a cool place, fancy ass if you're a student too and all that. The food is pretty average and the sides definitely taste better than the mains. The drinks are good and the service is quick. But they need to work on their food because CP has so many other joints that are amazing.",Rated 3.0,20,7,??

Dr Monal A Daptardar,"Rated Great gastronomic experience. The chicken they serve is so juicy and flavourfull. The must try is chicken liver rolls, for appetizer's. Its a yummy delite. It has a not too over powering flavour of liver, which is creamy, spicy and melt's in your mouth. I love the chicken served here in any form.",Rated 4.0,48,78,??
Neha Gohil,"Rated Pretty good restaurant in terms of food and ambiance. However, the drawback was their service. You have to remind them that you have ordered something. Service needs a huge improvement.",Rated 3.0,2,0,??
Nandita Sharma,Rated Hated this place to the core! The food tasted nothing like what i had imagined it to be. The vegatables in my wrap and the paneer tasted as if they have been undercooked and everything including the beverages (which was so sour that i had to leave it after the 1st sip) was made without even taking taste into consideration ! Bad bad bad,Rated 1.5,31,38,??
Soumyadip Saha,"Rated I'd never tried African and Portuguese cuisine so this was on my wish list for sometime because not too many restaurants in kolkata offer the aforementioned cuisines. Took some time to locate it in CP. Big place. Spacious and well lit. Really liked the ambience with the background music playing on. Surely not a place to come alone. For starters, ordered chicken wings with wedges. It was served after ten minutes or so. The chicken really tasted different, well cooked but not spectacular. The peri peri herb sauce was amazing though. Then we ordered the famous peri peri chicken and it lived up to the expectations. Tender, not too spicy but delicious. Next were Espetada and Grilled Chicken Cataplana which were also okay. I had ordered Chicken Caesar Wrap for myself which was quite good. Other than that, citrus bliss and three Heineken beers. Cost :4500 rupees. Slightly on the higher side. Give it a try!",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Parul.sharif,Rated Not a Nando's fan but then though maybe in last 3 years things would have changed .. But disappointed again !! From really sad tasting n shrunken chicken to dry bread which was suppose to be a garlic bread to most funny looking n tasting grilled veggies .. Hahahaha can only laugh at the situation and hope they better up ..,Rated 1.5,8,2,??

Abhiram Dileep,"Rated I have visited and eaten at Nandos twice. The food is great, with fantastic flavours of peri peri chicken. Ambience is well maintained. However, the service time could be faster and the range of vegetarian options in the menu could be increased. Additionally, it would be nice if they added more potato wedges to the large sized serving.",Rated 3.5,18,65,??
Ridhi Tirkey,"Rated Nandos! Best Portuguese chicken in town! Perfect blend of ingredients in the flame grilled chicken. Courteous staff, great music and yummy food. Although one has to signal the staff here quite a few times and then they see you calling out. But yeah over all a good deal of chicken for that peri peri taste.",Rated 4.5,26,37,??
Parnnika Barolia,Rated Nando's is a nice place to visit.. good staff.. decent ambience..We visited Nando's to celebrate my friends bday and it's pretty decent place with good food. Though I am not much fan of the boiled vegetables they serve but peri peri chicken was fabulous.,Rated 3.5,10,33,??
Indranil Sarkar,"Rated Excellent Peri Peri Chicken. The ambiance and decor of the place is very good. Its a perfect place to enjoy a leisurely meal and talk. The seating arrangement carves out cozy nooks for the patrons. Though I would swear by the Peri Peri Chicken which is succulent and sumptuous, the food is okay on the average. The Espetada Carnival is not breathtaking, the only interesting part is the way it is served, dangling from a skewer above the plate. The Cataplana rice was exotic but...nothing spectacular in taste there either. Decent cheescake. We found the service lacking probably due to new hands/trainees (assumption). The waiters were not conversant about suggesting dishes or portion sizes or spices. Not very attentive either. I however intend to visit again to try their burgers. Definitely a different outlet though. Food 3/5 Ambiance 4/5 Service 2/5",Rated 3.0,42,37,??

Aman Mahajan,"Rated Dont know how long had this place been in my wishlist and boy wasnt it worth the wait. The FAMOUS peri peri chicken was delectable and the sides ordered with it were equally rollicking!! Peri peri wedges was well spiced and crispy, the grilled veg was juicy and tasted good. Special mention to their peri peri mix herb sauce, it was too good. The beer to go along was refreshing. The ambiance, interiors and the serving style feels totally american!!

Aman Goel,Rated Too be honest I have never tasted proper south african food but I have tasted the barbeque nation african menu and it tasted nothing like what Nando's served. I ordered some veegies(Idk! Tha kya wo?) and a wrap(nah! No idea) it tasted hahah(no idea!). And the service(oh! Man!) visit it and u will say(tha kya wo?!). Overall tasteless. No proper service.

Ankur Sharma,"Rated My friend recommended this place to me. At the entrance only, I found their way of attending their customers somehow different (in a good sense, though ). So I ordered Chicken Breast Burger with Mild PERI-PERI sauce. The first bite only that I took, made me say- Yumm. . the dish indeed was very delicious.

Niharika Vohra,Rated My first time to this place. Have been wanting to visit it for quite a long time. And it was worth the wait. Great food and great ambience. Even though the service was a bit slow but that can be ignored once the food goes into your mouth. Ordered chicken butterfly with two regular sides and it was amazing. The chicken breast piece was so good. Right taste and juicy and soft just as expected. Also had Citrus bliss which was quite refreshing. Overall good experience.,Rated 5.0,30,80,??
Harkirat Singh,"Rated Recently had dinner with my folks at Nandos, Connaught Place. Starting with the restaurant it wasn't as crowded on a Sunday which is very unusual so getting tables was not so much of a problem. The staff was courteous and welcoming and got us to our seats promptly. The restaurant is done up in a very contemporary kind of setting with wood as the main ingredients. They have a lot of nice little touches to the place which makes me come to the paintings on the wall which are very interesting g and nice and does bring a smile about your face because let's face it nobody hates art we just interpret it different. The food was served a bit late which is also unusual as the place wasn't crowded at all. We ordered the Butterfly chicken, Espatada and Espatada Carnival. The Butterfly Chicken was well cooked and I mean not under nor over. The Espatada also beautifully cooked. The Espatada Carnival was a miss though as it was more rice and vegetables than chicken but nonetheless tasted great with the spicy rice nicely complimenting the chicken. I did find the grilled zucchini/aubergines to be an off component in the dish and the sauces tasted a bit old to me. Most surprising was to discover that they had started alcoholic beverages as well for which we sadly didn't get a menu and dad had to find out after seeing the two gentlemen across the table having some. So consider it as a very fresh cherry on top of a really great cake. Really great place to hang out with friends/family, the prices do look a bit steep but are justified by the generous amounts in the servings. Must go for all.",Rated 4.0,3,129,??
Nimisha Mehta,Rated The place is mostly visited by me for its amazing peri peri chicken. I dont think so anybody else serves the dish that very deliciously! Their service also is quite commendable for that matter. We actually get full after two plates of the item only. The service is nice and the ambience is okay,Rated 4.0,20,41,??
Gurneet Kaur,"Rated I went to Nando's with my girl for a lunch date. Nando;s is known all over the world for their peri-peri chicken but interestingly we ate only vegetarian food. One thing that I really have to appreciate about the team is the fact that there is a separate menu for vegetarians to avoid any confusion. We ordered the VEG BURGER which was big enough to fill one person. The tangy yoghurt sauce gave a very interesting favor. I opted for the extra hot spicy level for the burger as I enjoy spicy food. I just wish there was more sauce in the burger. It was a little dry for my liking. Next we ordered the VEG ESPETADA. It is an interesting dish served on a skewer. Should be ordered only if you love veggies. The panneer was marinated to perfection. Mushrooms, broccoli and what not. Theirs is the best I have had so far at this price. There are two levels of seating and an open kitchen makes for an interesting sight. The service can be a little quicker.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Without missing a mark, the interiors are well built and seating area well distributed for enough walking and directional spacing.

Chinmmay,"Rated Heaven for a Chicken Lover. If you have never been to Nando's here the tip. You will fall in love with the grilled chicken and you will enjoy the crisp chicken skin like anything. Nando's was on top list during visit to capital and location is simply right. Please don't ask for Parking!! What makes chicken taste better is the various sauces served with it and it's as per liking of everyone's taste. Ambiance is nice and place is huge, you have option to sit upstairs but I chose a downstairs table, so that I can enjoy hustle and bustle of CP, while having my meal. Menu has selective items around grilled chicken and be wise and choose your sides. My recommendation:Garlic Bread to meet your hunger, Coleslaw to cool down the taste buds, Potato Wedges for Spices. You can experiment with various sauce combination. I would say Hot Peri Peri, and Garlic Peri Peri which goes well. You can digest try Extra Hot Peri Peri.

Himanshu Sukhpal,"Rated The experience of an everyday diner, I was along with friends and we ordered a combo of breast butterfly and espetada along with the sides, which didn't look like when it got served but turned out to be quite filling, the chicken didn't have a really different or unique taste but their obsession with chilli managed to take over the creative part what really caught my attention was the concept of bottomless soft drink, while it's a nice move, yet it is a lot of calorie intake, nice ambience and service, a fine experience it was.",Rated 4.5,17,124,??

One would love to have just seating only, as the aroma of the flavours from the chicken would trigger your taste buds. Grilled Chicken tenders- boneless chicken pieces grilled up in peri peri sauce. I ordered mild spicy. It was something new that i had tasted. The flavour of the chicken was truly blemishing. Service couldn't be better than this.

Sugandha Bansal,Rated Been to Nandos a couple of times . It's the place to go when all u want is some flavoursome succulent delicious chicken! I have tried peri peri chicken at various places in delhi but nothing beats the flavour that Nandos serve. The chicken is so soft that u will fall in love with it. U can order it at various levels of spice . I usually prefer the mild peri peri. The vegetarian food options are not that great and I wasn't too impressed with the burgers either. The sides are okay. Among the drinks my favourite is the Portuguese lemonade which is a must order! Madeira red is also nice. However the rest of the designer drinks are not good . Interiors are nice and the staff is courteous . Overall I would say don't go if u r a vegetarian and stick to ordering peri peri chicken only!!,Rated 4.0,23,36,??

Preetika Gupta,"Rated Nandos is famous all over the world for Portuguese & African cuisine. They provide very quick service & nice with some delicious dishes. Nandos at Connaught Place has spacious interiors. It has the same wooden dcor like its other branches. They serve both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, but this place is a meant actually only for chicken lovers. Everyone knows the secret to Nandos recipe i.e. Nandos PERi-PERi sauce range. Nandos cooking sauces and marinades, and of course, the world-famous peri peri chicken is what makes Nandos a most loved place for non-vegetarians. Try Peri Peri Hummus and Pita. The Pita slices are soft and fluffy, the hummus creamy and tangy.I love roasted veggies & paneer on skewers, Spicy rice, coleslaw, corn-on-the-cob, pitas and wraps to choose from. Though Nandos has increased vegetarian options in the menu, the food for vegetarians here is no incredulous. The menu card is small & cool. Cartoons, fonts, color combos all make it unique. Staff is pretty friendly, quick and polite, To summarize, the food quality is good, the ambience and service too is good. chocolateandpistachios.wordpress.com",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Saurabh,Rated Had a great time at Nando's. We ordered their signature Peri Peri chicken with sides of Cole slaw. I think the sides are average tasting but the rotisserie chicken is quite delectable.

Priyanka Sinha,"Rated We tried Chicken butterfly and Espetada carnival at Nando's. Especially liked the second preparation, not just for its taste but also the presentation. It was well done chicken thighs marinated with cheese and herbs and presented on skewers. We'd ordered for mildly spicy preparations and should have ideally gone for hot, as mild borders on bland for someone with an Indian palate.

Unfortunately I chose my birthday to visit this place. We ordered the peri peri chicken, morroccon butternut gourmet burger, veggie burger and chicken breast burger. The chicken and everything was just average, they only gave us one sauce, whereas they usually should give us 3. They mixed up all the tags like mild spicy and medium spicy, the morrocon butternut burger was okayish, but anything else is a strict NO. Furthermore I would like to mention the garlic bread was awful, disgusting and all the bad adjectives. It was more like Pao Bhaji buns, buttered and heated.

Butterfly chicken is boneless and easier to eat, so we generally prefer that. If you cannot hog too much, you can go for Tender chicken strips with spicy rice:) Go for an ""Extra Hot"" spice level choice..and try out the Extra hot sauce or Hot sauce and the wild herb sauce:D In Delhi, the CP outlet is the best since it's more spacious and more convenient, plus has a better ambience compared to the other outlets.",Rated 4.5,18,23,??

However, I was bit surprised to see that they do have quite a few vegetarian things on the menu. We had ordered veg espetada with side as peri peri wedges, grilled chicken tenders and Portuguese lemonade. Honestly, the peri peri wedges were absolutely fresh, hot and delicious. However, on the other hand the veg espetada was neither hot nor it was good in taste. I found it bland!! Grilled chicken tender's sauce in which it was prepared was good. The Portuguese lemonade was again made in peri peri.. Which was different in taste but by the end of it, it was too much of peri peri in everything. I was disappointed and not at all impressed with the food preparation apart from the peri peri wedges.

On the other hand, the vegetarian options are quite limited. We ordered the mushroom & Paneer wrap and the roasted veggie wrap, and both were just average. Not something I'd order again.

When asked for a normal glass of the same, the waiter totally denied! I mean what rocket science does it even take to make a glass of wine and add freshly chopped apples to it!

I had the Humus/Pita, Red Pepper Dip/Pita starters which were quite good. The Peri-Peri chicken wings were just average, seemed quite bland. The tableside sauces (Peri-peri Hot and Garlic) were very enjoyable. The 'Designer drinks' for all their fanciness just tasted of Sprite although the Portuguese Ice Tea was good. For the main course we had the Chicken Thighs stuffed with Feta cheese which was good. The Peri-peri chips are just plain french fries with some spice sprinkled on top and their Spicy Rice was not spicy at all, just ordinary (bland) rice. The Carrot cake was the dessert but we could not finish it due to it being overly sweet and heavy.

Hygiene issues - The restaurant was open but the washroom was closed for renovation. I was asked to visit the public toilet outside. Imagine the germs I carried in back to everyone's plates and guts. Including mine. Even though I did wash my hands, how many are nonchalant? - I leave that to your imagination. Staff was courteous but their conversations were very rote, the hospitality was not from the heart. We were not served a glass of water or even asked for it. We had to specifially ask for 2 glasses of water when ordering dessert. Guys - serve water to your guests, a dry throat does not breed a good customer experience! Menu says - ""Chicken Butterfly - Succulent double chicken breast in crispy skin"" - Well guys my dish had ""soggy, flip flop rubbery skin"". On pointing this out, no one asked for an exchange or suggested an alternate dish - your staff was busy explaining with ethusiasm why there was this typo on the menu - as if I care. I am a cheapstake, I had to fill my stomach, the taste was forgiving enough, so I finished it eventually using a conversation as an excuse to my palate.

Bariya,"Rated Relatively quiet and comfortably occupied on a national holiday afternoon, nando's CP is a decent choice for lunch. I had 1/4th chicken with peri-wedges on the side. The chicken was huge for me (a person with lesser than an average person's appetite) and the potato wedges seemed to never end. Also, they did not have much flavour to offer. The sauces on the table were quite a necessity. I had used lemon and herb on the peri-o-meter for the chicken and it gave me a very KFC-ish relish. The chicken was fairly tender, although edging a little towards the dry side. I clubbed this with refreshmint drink. The forever reliable mojito was stripped off its reliability with too much ice (I never thought that could even be a thing). Shivam Ashutosh Singh had grilled chicken tenders with spicy rice and garlic bread (which was just bland and nothing else) and was very disappointed with the quantity.

They cook their chicken in their famous peri peri sauce, which is AMAZING! First chicken we ordered was lemon and herb, which was lip smacking good. The second was hot, and it surely was! The sides we ordered, included garlic bread, spiced rice and peri peri fries. The garlic bread was more a bun than bread but yummy nonetheless. The rice were good, but some gravy was missing. The fries- YUM!! We then ordered an espetada with 2 sides, coleslaw and 3 bean salad. The espetada, though creamy and well cooked, can be skipped. The coleslaw was delicious and well prepared. The 3 bean salad that was served tasted funny and had surely gone bad. Our server gladly replaced it with a side of potato wedges, which were good, sprinkled with the same peri peri dust as the fries. We also ordered 3 bottomless Cokes and I personally love the idea! :P We ordered a carrot cake, a choco cake and a cheesecake.

And then we ordered a chicken with fetta cheese. A very disappointing dish. Fetta chese was not there at all in the stuffing.

Prakriti,"Rated Nandos has been pleasing people since ages. Its an international food chain and has branches in many countries. Customers swear by their peri peri chicken. Available in varying levels of spice, it surely plays with your taste buds. This outlet is quite spacious. Red hues dominate the decor. Jute lanterns illumiate the place and a fancy staircase leads you to the first floor. We ordered a full chicken platter, Madeira Red and a mint based mocktail. First of all, Madeira sounds like the hindi word ""Madira"" (alcohol)! This pomegranate drink is a pefect blend of the fruit and Sprite. The other drink Refreshing Mint wasnt that great with the mint overpowering all other flavours. Finally came the much talked about Peri Peri Chicken. The pieces were HUGE. Capitalisation of alphabets is the only way I can explain it! There were 4 pieces and we got down to our savage selves to devour them! Mildly spiced and griiled well, every bite was heavenly. However, i felt that it was a bit dry from within; not succulent enough. It wasn't undercooked, just less juicy. The platter came with a choice of 4 side dishes. We ordered coleslaw, fries, wedges and garlic bread. Each of these worked well with the chicken. The staff was very attentive and served us with a smile. Overall it was a nice but pricey affair.

I ordered hot peri peri but that was not spicy and wrap was very dry. Grilled vegetables were amazing and indeed they have mind blowing collection of ketchup and sauce..

Debroto Roy,"Rated We first got introduced to Nandos in UK and so wished that we get our own in India. The wish came true sometime back when they launched themselves here. By far the juiciest chicken preparation based entirely on the popular Peri-peri sauce theme... they have conveniently converted one of the most basic ingredients into a full menu. While they can do with some innovation in the vegetarian section, the chicken ( we kind of have tried almost everything on the menu) does touch your soul.",Rated 4.0,97,49,??

Me and my friends went there on the 26th of October and it was my friend's birthday and the way they treated us was absolutely unacceptable. When we went there there were only 2-3 other occupied tables and after sometime we realised when the restaurant was almost full and everybody had their food in front of them even though we were the first ones to order.. We called the waiter 3 times and they would ignore us.. And it had been 1 and half hour since we were there.. Obviously, we were quite pissed so we asked them directly that if you're really wasting our time then don't and ask us to leave and they said they will send their manager.. 10 more minutes and nobody came. After an hour and 40 minutes we got up and left and the manager didn't even bother to ask.. Seriously, I would rather take a bullet than recommend this place to someone.. Or not..

Catchy Afro music, trendy decor and overall a fun laid back ambience. To their credit they had a separate veg menu, from which we ordered a roasted veg n paneer platter and a wrap with a three bean salad on the side. The boys went for what else but peri peri chicken and the gourmet burger. The flavours were altogether new for us.

Juicy, succulent and perfectly seasoned. We opted for a full chicken with two sides. Sides were equally good. You can opt for the hotness if sauce. We choose mild and added more. Value for money: a full chicken, two sides with bottomless coke cost us around 1200 or so. If you are two people, would suggest stick to half a chicken as the portion size is big.

Himanshu Kashyap,"Rated It has been a while since Nando's has opened in Connaught Place and I decided to give it a try. Nando's is a big name internationally and naturally I had very high hopes for the place. First, the ambiance. It was very good, something which was expected from this place. They have ample seating room, comfortable chairs and welcoming interiors. The staff and the service are excellent. Full points for that. However, when it comes to food Nando's turned out to be a big disappointment. Although it is supposed to be the home of Peri Peri chicken, the food tastes bland. They do offer customization. You can always add spiciness to your food with that extra Peri Peri. Unfortunately it fails to enhance the flavour of Peri Peri. Instead it only makes the food spicy. Maybe the place is not suited for Indian tastebuds. Flavour is important. Unless there is a noticeable flavour of their spices, this place will continue to serve the same bland chicken. Different people have different preferences. When I intend to have spicy food, I expect it to have flavour and not just spiciness. The drinks also need improvment. I ordered Refreshmint which turned out to be nothing but a diluted Mojito. Also, serving size is very small. We Indians eat a lot. Small serving only makes things worse for this place. Other than food this place is perfect in every other sense. But if food is not good, then what else can be expected from a restaurant? VERDICT: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT",Rated 2.5,38,12,??

Added to the wide peri peri variety, they also have a new designer drinks menu to choose from. Thank god for such bliss full experience.

Its juicy, tender and filling. I order sides with this which is mainly Coleslaw and twisted curls. The coleslaw too is something which is fresh and tastes the best in the whole of Delhi.

The seats were comfortable. The staff was polite. They have to and they did know their menu very well.

It was delicious. ORDER : Refreshmint : It had ample mint flavour in it. It also had a tinge of the Mojito which was nice. The drink had a nice flavours completing each other nicely. Chicken Burger : This was accompanied by the perfect fries and wedges and perfect Perinaise as suggested to go with it. Chicken Platter : This was the highlight of the day. Even after craving for, and having really good burgers, thus dish took the day away. The chicken was tender and juicy. We had it made with the peri sauce with gave it really spicy and tasty texture. The knife went through the chicken nicely, and while at it, the chicken bursted with all the juices inside it. Really loved the dish. We had Coleslaw and potato wedges with it, which were crisp and also had a really nice dip to complement it. Cheese Cake : A perfect dessert to end the perfect meal. I could taste heaven in it.

Rinks !!,"Rated One of my favourite eating place as I am a chicken lover. I would love to give 4.5 but rated 3.5 as thr peri peri masala was out of stock. Yes it was out of stock and I was so surprised and they asked me to have sauce instead. I went thr to specialy hv fries with the masala which tempts me but I am not so lucky. We had Whole Chicken Platter with spicy rice, peri fries, garlic bread and Coleslaw as Sides and Beer. I had garlic bread for 1st time here and it was perfect. Really loved it. Chicken and Coleslaw were very tasty. But this time I did not enjoy the fries as it is incomplete without the Peri peri masala. Though I adjusted with the Wild Herb peri peri sauce but it was not so yum. For Spicy rice I would say it was 98% for flavour. Something was missing or may be it was not fully cooked. Beer was served chilled :) Overall had good food experience. Music was good and the place was all packed. Though we did 20 min waiting for food but it ended on a ""Tummy kush"" note.

Its an amazing place with an awesome ambiance along with a good serving staff. This place is famous for its peri peri chicken and i think they are the best at it. We ordered chicken along with 4 sides. All this comes in a meal and you can choose among 6-7 sides that are available. I haven't had this type of fries before. They were so crisp from the outside and even more softer from the inside like ideal fries should be. Corns were ok but the chicken was so good. Whole chicken cut into 4 pieces and you can imagine the size of each piece. It was so soft and tender that could be easily eaten with the help of a fork and knife but it tastes better when you eat it with your hands. Also the sauces were really good and they serve bottomless coke which is nothing but unlimited coke. You can ask for a refill any no. of times. The prices were a bit on the higher side but you can visit this place once in a while just to have great chicken. Must visit! Highly recommended! Cheers!,Rated 4.0,11,112,??

Though these people had the best chicken breast fries I have ever had. A full 4 for that. The mocktails were sad. And hence Try as I might , I cant bring myself to give them more than 4.

Chef.negi.,"Rated Been here recently with friends , it's a nice cool place with kitchen right in front . The kitchen was kept really clean and they do maintain good standards of hygiene . We tried two different burgers Peri Peri and the other one with mango and arugula .The combination of mango and arugula is really nice , the peppery taste of arugula gets easily balanced by the sweetness of mango . My chicken burger was fine . I am quite sure they use homemade ciabatta for burgers instead of regular burger buns .I was ok with my burger on ciabatta but my friend didn't really appreciate the same . There is a thing with ciabatta it's gets really chewy if it's not fresh . So I guess my friend was unlucky there with the bread but the staff cooperated well and offered us fresh burger but my friend refused and so they didn't charge us for one burger . The peri peri sauce they serve on the table in a long bottle was really nice and something to remember ,such Sauces are not so common after all ,it complimented my burger really well .

Kalpana Khatri,"Rated If you are catching up with your friends and looking for place to chit chat, this place is a fit for those good times!!! I was meeting up an old friend of mine on recent visit to Delhi in CP and both of us wanted to try out a new place. While walking through the inner circle, we happen to notice this place. The exteriors of the place is nothing but see through glass but that was the trick! They have created their interior in such a chic way that it is bound to catch your attention even from outside. The place is decorated with nice lighting, quote frames and portraits ( Loved the unconventional decor ). Right at the entrance you will find the bar along with chicken grillers and it has seating arrangement bifurcated into two floors. It was 2.30 in the afternoon and the place was fully occupied. We managed a table for two on the ground floor. The waiters were prompt in service and paid full attention to individual tables. Since we were in a chit chat mood so we were more focused on the mocktail section ( both being off alcohol for a while :P). We ordered Refresh Mint and Citrus bliss along with grilled chicken pita. The pita was a good, light-to-eat food nicely stuffed with fresh veggies and grilled chicken. Citrus Bliss: A light pink color gave a catchy look to this drink. Refreshing in taste, a little on the sweeter side. Refresh Mint: It was a surprise. It looked like a heap of green ice!! It had a nice minty flavor but the only issue was you have to wait for it to melt so that you can sip it through your straw, At one moment i did feel like grabbing a spoon and eating it off. Luckily we had a lot of time to kill so it was kind of a blessing in disguise :P. So final score card: Ambiance: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Food: 4/5: Basis the pita wrap Cleanliness: 2/5: This part took us by surprise. In a place so well decorated, why does a waiter has to hold one of those mosquito racquets ( one which look like tennis racquets) and run behind the flies to kill them, Please get an automatic fly trapper >.<. Would love to give this place a second shot with more focus on the food front (post fly trapper installation :P).",Rated 3.5,40,279,??

Daksha Patel,"Rated I read few reviews before visiting Nandos as they were hoisting for it big time. However, my experience with it did not go the way I had expected. It is popular for the peri peri sauces and seasonings which I found quite average and not that tasty. I just had a classic veggie burger there and found it be quite bland.

DON'T GO IF YOU ARE A VEGETARIAN menu should be modified a little according to the region they are serving food into. ours is not a meat based country, and every foreign outlet whether wendy's, burger king has put up stuff for both kind of people here. tried some classic veg burger which is the only thing i could swallow :P bad experience.",Rated 2.0,34,145,??

Samjyor Lepcha,"Rated Had been wanting to go there for a while now. We had to wait for quite a while as there was a long queue that day. We had a Grilled Chicken Pita, a Three Beans Salad, a 5 Chicken Wings, a Grilled Butterfly Chicken with Peri- fries, iced peach tea and a cappuccino. The grilled chicken pita was just awesome, the chicken breast was juicy and succulent. The three beans salad was the perfect side dish for it. The 5 chicken wings was satisfactory, but it was not that great. There was something missing. We were expecting it to have more flavour and more spiciness. We had peri-fries, but unfortunately they had run out of peri peri spice, which was pretty disappointing. The grilled butterfly chicken (which we already had with the pita bread) was great. The ambience is nice, but we had a hard time getting the staff to attend to us. Will visit again.

Vegetarians think many many times before u come here! Very little options, and one of them we chose was a Paneer and Mushroom wrap. I was searching for the mushrooms in it and actually asked the server where they were. He said ""mam there are 2 MUSHROOMS in this dish!!! One in each wrap can u freaking believe it!??? They talk about their HYGIENE levels well there was a WORM in the wrap! Must have been from the lettuce in it. N the rice dish....well haldi walk chawal with some chickpeas n peppers n paneer thrown in. No flavouring except the strong haldi smell.

Then we ordered chicken roll, peri peri chicken with a regular portion of spicy rice and vegetable roll. I had eaten vegetable roll and it was different. It was full green spinach , vegetables ,with lots of mayonnise or sour curd. It was crunchy. Greens were just perfectly fresh and crunchy . It was more like fresh spinach. I just loved that roll.

Dillikabhukkad,"Rated It was one of those days when we were large in number and wanted to decimate food which didnt hurt our pockets and at the same time felt good both in quality and quantity. And here we were having our dinner at nandos. Lets start with some bad points about this place which i would without hesitation say is the GARLIC BREAD. It was more of a kulcha with a cheese slice over it rather than a garlic bread and i had to send it back telling the chef that it had no garlic whatsoever. A total disaster on this front. Please dont order, anyone. Moving on to the vegetarian dishes, they were simply bland and distasteful. The white burger and the hummus with pita bread could have passed as home made food. Now comes the dish for which i am rating this place as 3/5 - the chicken peri peri. Agreed that the chicken is very average but the combo with bottomless soft drinks makes a person with a huge hunger satisfied. The peri peri hotness hardly troubled me, although i ordered extra hot. Also, the perinaise sauce is a serious pushover. Why is it even on the menu i will never understand. A salty dip no one likes. All in all, go to this place if you have a large number and want to get over the dinner cheaply with no extravagance. Chop chop.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Since we were two people so they told me to order the whole chicken plus 4 sides. There were 4 chicken pieces in it. After eating one piece and some colestaw and the spicy rice my stomach was almost full. So what I want to tell is that if you are a tanker then you should order this. And the taste was so good. The chicken was sweet and juicy. Hope you also enjoy here.",Rated 4.0,48,50,??

Shubham Sharma,"Rated I went there in the morning, right when they open. We were greeted with warm smiles and directed to one of the tables. Looking around, one can find the decor really peppy and loaded with rustiness of Americana. The order was brief and comprised of a grilled chicken cataplana, coffee, Citra, refresh mint and a burger. The fragrance of peri peri sauce was omnipresent though subtly. The chicken was so juicy and well marinated that it alone deserves full points. The spices and their tanginess was emanating with each bite, which truly made that divine. The drinks were remarkably average, only coffee was the saving grace. For true blue chicken lovers looking to get great grilled western variety, this place is a heaven but yes keep your cash loaded. I found the menu harsh on vegetarians particularly. Overall, I guess one or two visits aren't enough to justify the goodness of this place.",Rated 4.5,29,289,??
Tarun Talwar,"Rated This place is mostly full and a waiting of 15-20 mins is a pre-requisite if you are planning to go to Nando's. I particularly like to sit on the upper deck of the restaurant.

Sharmishtha Shukla,"Rated DAY 64 My weekday blues are no longer blues thanks to this place which just made my day. I was a little hesitant to try this place as its chiefly chicken but their separate vegetarian menu made me take the risk and it was worth the risk. Not much variety but whatever is their on the menu is amazing. Spicy rice is dicey as one might not like the strong turmeric flavor that it gives. The veggie burger was worth every penny charged. The drinks were also great but only if they could reduce the ice as it becomes more of a ice drink only and less of flavors. Do not miss the the choco cake as its absolute bliss though a bit of a suggestion to the management dat if u served some vanilla with the cake it would be even better. Not to forget, ambience is alright though seats are slightly uncomfortable. Staff and service are good but after the initial hospitality they forget you and have keep calling them if you need something.

They have a nice outlet here in CP , a seating on both ground and first floor . We were given a table on first floor . The rush was normal given that it was sunday evening . It was nice to see that they had a separate menu for the vegetarians. Me and my friend being non-vegetarians stood to our chicken . We Ordered the following ( everything in extra hot ) : 3 Chicken Wings : There was less chicken and more bone . Also it did not appeal the taste buds . Grilled Chicken Butterfly with Potato wedges : Quantity is less , even our waiter warned us for the same . It tastes good in the initial bites with the upper grilled layer but as you go deep it gets bland , very bland . The potato wedges were good. One thing I would like to say , I did not find the food items spicy at all not even close to extra hot . So ya don't get your expectations high on that front . Portuguese Lemonade: This was a surprise . We couldn't make out what were its ingredients. ( Spicy , Citrus and I think some more flavours ) Service was average . We didnt have the sauce bottles on our table . We had to ask for them and they appeared only when we were almost done with our meal .

A.V.,"Rated I love Nando's for the simplicity of the menu; the no bullshit Grilled chicken being the luminary. The ambiance is amazing as is the food and decor. The funny thing about the place though is this peri peri sauces they offer. If you are as adventurous as I and order the spiciest one, the person taking the order asks at least twice to make sure you're really up for the heat. The real bummer here is the fact that even the extra hot isn't nearly hot enough. But that was the only setback. The salads were really fresh, as was the grilled chicken. The service was fast too.

Being vegans, we had Hummus w/ Pita, Wraps with Coleslaw Dressing (recommended by the service person), Madeira Red and Rosa Fresca The food was great.

Sanket Banerjee,Rated Ambience layout crowd everything perfect that's y 3.5 stars. Now comes the food. The first think I would like to say about food is - it was really dry. Since it was my first visit at nando's I was not aquatinted with the food and menu. The menu was not user friendly at all since I had to choose from non veg menu I asked the waiter what would be the best in main course so he insisted grilled butterfly chicken so I ordered that with two sides that were potato wedges and garlic bread but when it arrived it appeared to be so dry. Somehow I managed to eat with the sauces provided. The taste was nothing fro sky. I have had way better continental. The waiters should actually suggest that this combination would be very dry so you should change it !!! Next was angry mango with pita. The centre was decent while the edges were just flour. Again very dry ! For a new customer the experience in Nando's will not be enchanting at all may be for a regular customer it manageable but I am pretty sure to make a new customer a regular customer Nando's management should really describe their dishes or train their staff to suggest good combination based on the customer's choices.,Rated 3.5,40,328,??

Sidharth Sood,Rated Well vegetarian people always get discriminated.. That's what i felt here. I don't think this is meant for vegetarians even in their menu veg food is difficult to find nd by that i mean worth trying veg food. So after alot of finding thinking nd introspecting i decided to try 1.Caesar salad - it was actually tasty!! 2. Portuguese salad - fine but i doubt if the taste was what its name suggests it should be. 3. Veg burger - just ok 4. Corn on the cob 5. Designer drinks- refresh mint The ambience was fine so was their service The reason i am giving 4 stars-the level of discrimination against us the veggies was tolerable given d fact that this is mainly for meat lovers!!,Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Stephen Armer,"Rated Where to start. I waited for ages to be served, maybe 15 minutes sat on my own - a single diner! I was on the verge of leaving when I finally managed to attract someones attention to serve me - I wish I had left as the experience did not improve. Ordered Chicken Wings (HOT), Chicken Burger (HOT) and garlic bread with cheese and fries. Firstly the spice level of HOT was not hot at all - I would class it as mild at the best. My fries were luke warm - like they had been on the plate for 10 minutes before being brought to my table. The cheese on the garlic bread looked like cheap sliced cheese - hardly melted and was 40 rupees per slice - JUST FOR THE CHEESE! The service in this place needs to improve - it wasn't just me, the tables next to me were struggling too. I'm from the UK and Nando's in UK would have half the staff as in India but level of service would be twice! 4 staff were stood by the door just chatting - why can you not be productive and serve customers? Was expecting to eat here again very soon but will give it a miss now.",Rated 3.0,8,2,??
Sushant Chib,"Rated I've been here twice and to their vasant kunj outlet as well. There was no waiting and the staff was prompt in their service and well versed with the dishes. I've tried quite a few dishes - the traditional peri peri chicken, the burger(both veg and non veg) pita and hummus, corn on the cob, and the Moroccan rice. Overall, the chicken is the stand out dish. Its wonderfully cooked, soft and tender(unlike some places where the chicken is overcooked) and since i ordered the hot variety it had just the right amount of heat. The reason I've given a lower rating is simple. The dishes although well cooked all rely on their signature peri peri sauce for flavour. In fact, even the sauces they give on the table are peri peri. Thus the dishes are great individually, but just lack the satistaction you would get on eating a meal with a variety of flavours which complement each other really well. Overall, it's worth a visit!

Meat Men,Rated After hearing a lot about thr chicken finally decided to drop in on an afternoon... First impression on the place : really nicely set up.. Food menu is simple and short ..called for a super hot piri piri chicken (full portion) which didn't look as huge after it arrived since they had sliced the pieces which I didn't expect.. To my sadness it was not spicy at all. I mean when u call it super hot u at least make it mildly hot.. anyways I don't get the hype about this place the chicken was very nicely cooked and was falling of the bone but neither it had any strong flavor nor it ws spicy !! Only credit for the chicken sud go to the chicken itself for being super healthy :) Beers were nice and cold with no happy hour structure ... Not going to go with the hype for now !! Better chickens available at many other places.,Rated 2.5,30,163,??

Coming to food, we ordered veg espatada, classic veggie burger and old monk (yes, they gave me old monk on weekend night :). To be quite frank i guess i have to develop taste for their food as it didnt taste bad at all, but at the same moment it didnt blow me away. They let you customize your food, give options for sides, and their portions are filling. Service is again very good and they get 5/5 on ""value for money"" as our bill was just for 1056/-.

Meghna Joshi,"Rated Id been meaning to try this place for quite some time - having eaten at its international cousin some years ago (and remembering only the part where kid-me needed copious amounts of water) I was curious to jog some childhood memories. Finding it, however, was purely coincidental - starving after having waited for a friend at the metro for quite some time, we decided to walk into the first place we saw which happened to be Nandos. The place is more naturally lit than a lot of restaurants in CP, and well spaced out too. Despite being decently packed, the staff was attentive and service quick. The Indian branch has a dedicated vegetarian menu which, batted away with laughs from us and the server, could use some expansion. If youre going to have a separate menu, might as well make it solid. Still, might be an attraction for those deterred by the signature chicken dishes Nandos is known for. We began with the Algarve Salad and a Refresh Mint. The salad was a huge hit, being loaded with feta and sun-dried tomatoes, two favourites. The mint cooler was nice, a bit like the KFC crusher in a fancier glass. Not overly sweet, so points for that. Next came their famous Peri-peri chicken. We opted for a 1/2 chicken, which comes on the bone. The portions were more than enough for two - even though we were eying the espetada, neither of us had the space left to eat any more. The chicken was juicy and flavourful, skin crispy and the sauce went really well with the chicken, tart in a way that made me want to slather a lot more over my food, but it really wasnt as spicy as I expected it to be even after adding the extra-hot sauce. A bit of a let down since I was expecting a lot more spice, but really great otherwise. The accompanying cheese garlic bread however, could use some work - neither cheesy (two teeny strips of cheese melted over the top does not count), nor garlicky, it was more of a soft grilled bun. A good place for those who love ample quantities of juicy chicken, but not somewhere Id make a huge effort to go to unless I just happened to be in the area.",Rated 3.5,11,33,??

The decor . ambience and most importantly the aroma of good food welcomes you the moment you enter. The seating , though a little cramped , gives you good vibes making it a perfect place to hang with friends , not really a date place to say that way.Coming to the food , their signature Peri Peri is just the thing which keeps you coming back. Awesome taste, succulent with spiciness oozing out of every bit. Get down and get your hands on it, and its heaven ! Peri Peri wedges are the best to tag along with this .The burgers I feel are not as good, The Angry Chicken burger was strange in taste, however it was not a complete disaster.They make good Sangria and LIIT, not the nest in town though.

We then ordered cataplana algarve (lemon mild sauce), black mushroom & grilled paneer pita (hot sauce), grilled chicken wrap (mild sauce). Within drinks we got madeira red, rosa fresca and foster's draught beer glass. We really liked Cataplana Argava which was served in a traditional brass wok. The pita was okayish in taste. I did not like the mushrooms quality that much. The chicken wrap was good. As far as the drinks are concerned, they were quite outstanding. The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice.

Deepali Dobhal,"Rated Since Nando's has established itself as a brand now ,I think they have lost all motivation to worry as to why a customer did not like their food .At least that's what I felt after my first visit to Nando's today. They offer you a uptown image ,a good seating space and a very hip dcor ,but when it comes to food I guess Nando's is still ""nouveau food business"". I ordered a Moroccan butternut and grilled peppers veg burger with a side of Peri peri fries and a coke. The food arrived and well did not taste as exotic as it was named .I was riding solo so I only ordered one dish .Good decision on my part since I ended up not eating what I ordered too. The only part good about the dish were the fries .Although they could use more Peri Peri spice. I mean with what you pay at Nando's the least you could get are all your fries properly coated with the said spice. Moving on to the burger about which everything was wrong.The peppers were raw ,so was the butternut. The bun to patte ratio was just Sad !.Not to mention the bun was very dry and the there was some sauce in the burger which was so sour ,it overpowered whatever little taste the patte might have had .I felt like I was eating squished lemon potato mash with a dry bun. I only at my fries and left the burger only after one or two bites because honestly my taste buds could not take the assault of the lemon anymore.Also the peri peri sauce that Nando's prouds itself upon was also not what I expected. I ordered the ""hot sauce "" since you can choose the level of spice .The sauce was everything but hot .Actually it was only sour and nothing else. I don't know why had so much lemon in everything. Peri peri is supposed to be a spicy sauce .Sour cuts heat .And one would think that a place basing itself on peri peri sauces would know this simple culinary fact. I don't know of they are ignorant or simply set in there ways but that was not peri peri. The thing that really bugged me was while clearing my table the server after looking at my plate which wasn't even half eaten enquired as to whether I enjoyed my food. I didn't and I told him so and that was it.He suggested I should try a hotter peri peri sauce and I told him that sauce wouldn't change the quality of the dish. And then he just told me something as obvious as ""Ma'am actually we are famous for our peri peri "" and left. Ok ,So if you're famous for peri peri that means your dishes are supposed to taste this awkward ? Too bad for us ! After that I went to pay my bill but it seemed that no one at Nando's had any interest in knowing why I left my food untouched or why I did not like it ? . Anyway I paid around 550 INR for the food I did not eat or more like ""could"" not eat. The only things that did go down my throat were the Fries and coke. I guess the reason Nando's is famous only for peri peri sauce is because their sauce is the saving grace that masks their mediocre food.I don't think I'd go back there again or suggest you to go either.",Rated 2.0,44,217,??

This place has its own charm to it :D This place is was highly recommended by one of my friends Bhawani Singh and well chance had it, it was him only who got me to this place for a Sunday lunch. The instant I entered Nando's I fell in love with this place. Just love the vibe this place gives out. We were 7 of us and chose to sit upstairs. The sitting is little cramped if you have friends who are on the heavy built side, but in n all the sitting is comfortable. Right after we got comfortable we just got down to ordering our food. They have a lot to offer in veg and non-veg dept. My vegetarian friend ordered for PERI-PERI Hummus and Pita and Veg Espetada. 6 of us (the non-v ones :P) called for 3 Chicken Wings, PERI wedges, 2 Grilled Butterfly Chicken, Espetada (Chicken) w/t Garlic bread (w/t cheese), 1/2 Chicken and bottom less Coke to go. The Hummus and Pita was quite good. Hummus was as it is supposed to be. Peri 3 Chicken wings was quite spicy and yes we loved it. The chicken was done to perfection and the spiciness was just right. Peri wedges were so-so nothing great about them. Now the Grilled Butterfly Chicken was the highlight for me! The Chicken slab was done to the perfection, little juicy and flavored right with right spices. :D Same goes for Espetada chicken; now the Espetada Chicken comes on a sheekh upside down and the fun is to take the pieces out carefully and have it.

Rameeza Hakeem,"Rated Useless. If your coming to Nando's because of the name or because you have experienced it in London or some other international location don't bother with the one at Connaught Place. The ambience is not the usually warm, spicy home atmosphere you will be used to. It's a chilled over air-conditioned commercial environment with wooden tables and chairs just for effect. 2 servers for an entire floor and a disinterested and rather immature manager. It will take you a whole 10 minutes to get a servers attention, another 20 minutes for your food to begin to arrive. Now Nando's is not fine dining where people come to leisure a meal over 2 hours. It's akin to fast food, casual food based on turn around and quick numbers for the restaurant. The location of Connaught Place merely amplifies this further. And hence quick service ought to be a given. As for the food, it's below par. Below the international standards and even below the Vasant Kunj outlet. Again this is a gross injustice which franchisers of international brands do to their Indian clientele. There is a marked difference in the quality of the chicken, the freshness and crunchiness of the vegetables and in the overall level of the cuisine. Somehow when being served to Indians, the approach is- it's ok. It don't have to be like it is abroad. We are Indians. This actually hurts the brand. When I am next in London, I may fight shy of visiting a Nando's. Just the bad experience of this one will deter me. So all in all- No can do Nando's.",Rated 1.0,3,0,??

They grilled veggies seemed like they were put in a plate with some Nandos peri peri sauce that's it. The smoky flavour was missing. I was looking forward to garlic bread but that again was more buttery than garlic. The bread was so thick, it seemed more like a burger.

Arjun Uppal,"Rated First Review: Rating - 4.0 The food does not fail to disappoint! A real good place to have the actual taste of chicken. Great food. The Peri-Peri is a must have. Although the burger was not that good this time, I have had better burger earlier at Nando's. The ambience of the CP outlet is not great. I recommend the sitting upstairs on the first floor, ground floor sitting quite ordinary. Courteous staff. Second Review: Rating - 3.5 Nando's, a place that primarily for non-vegetarians, serves you with some delicious and mouth watering chicken. The 'Peri Peri' range of chicken is a must-have. It offers a number of sauce variants, which are is esessence the spicy variants you can take. The burgers and wraps are fairly decent with the chicken making up for everything. Of all the times, the service during this last visit was really bad. The attendants had to be called atleast twice for everything. A tip: If you do not have the peri peri chicken, going to Nando's would not be complete.",Rated 3.5,10,92,??

Kshitij Saxena,"Rated Had to try Nando's for it's famous Peri Peri Chicken. It is located in the F block as you start moving towards the outer circle. The staff was nice. The service was a bit slow, maybe because I went on a weekend. - The Peri Peri Chicken Espetada was really good. It's marinated and grilled and served as is. The medium hot Peri Peri sauce isn't hot enough for us, Indians. It's equivalent to packaged sauce you find in the markets. The grilled chicken, however tastes superb with the Peri Peri sauce. + We ordered two regular sides. The Peri potato wedges which were really good. Crispy wedges with a tinge of chilly. The 3 bean salad was disappointing. It was too sweet to go with the rest of the platter. - The Cataplana Algarve which is veg spicy rice and Paneer dish was also good. The Paneer was cooked well and the spicy rice added good flavour. - The Madeira Red mocktail was also nice, had the sweet Pomegranate flavour with sprite soda. - The Citrus mocktail was really good. It had grapefruit juice with sprite soda. The portions are way too small. Even after spending a lot of money, I didn't feel satisfied. I don't think the size of portions are worth the money they charge. Definitely not going back.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Kanika Berry,"Rated I went to Nandos today (CP) and ordered half chicken peri peri, roasted paneer with vegetables(on a bed of spicy rice) and chicken strips peri peri platter along with spicy rice as my side order. Now when we got our order the food tasted horrible (not the same it used to serve when it came). The vegetables tasted as if it has been prepared using stale oil, I could smell the bad pungent smell of the oil, the paneer is supposed to be roasted or grilled but it was fried paneer. The spicy rice which they serve as sides was also not freshly prepared, it was cooked 1-2 days before and was reheated in microwave by which it turned dry and every time I visit I find the quantity kept going down. The chicken was good would not say exceptional or wow but was ok. Nandos could never please me for their food as I have been to Nandos in Australia and there is no comparison between them. Their menu options are also not to extensive, I would rather recommend Barcelos for such food. They should learn from Barcelos for the variety, the quantity and the taste they offer.

Pallabi Datta,"Rated It was a lazy winter evening in Delhi, and as one does on such days, three of us were strolling through C.P while trying to decide which cafe we should have dinner at. Zomato invariably made an appearance on one of our phone's, and after much deliberation we decided to grace Nando's with our presence. The decor, accentuating a sense of quiet urban opulence, instantly struck a chord with us. The must-order dish was of course Peri-peri chicken- our first foray into African cuisine- complimented with fries and coleslaw. The food was served in decent time, considering the rush (by the time we left at around 8, there was a sizeable queue outside the place. So it's advisable to get there by 7 or else be prepared to wait for a longish period of time.) and we tucked in immediately. The sauce was mindblowing: ingredients meshing perfectly to create a rich, mouth-watering flavour and yet retaining their individuality which would be discernible by a true foodie. The chicken breast was perfectly cooked (I have a mental allergy towards rare/medium cooked meat). It was succulent and juicy and led to an explosion of flavours at every mouthful. The fries were as good as any we've had (McD's are still the best in my opinion) and even I was forced to admit that the coleslaw was crunchy and cool and hence complimenting the chicken well. (I am usually against corrupting my meal with any kind of leafs, temptations of mayonnaise notwithstanding.) So all in all, it was a very fulfilling experience. Wish Nando's would open a branch in Calcutta, since that's where I'm currently stationed.",Rated 5.0,5,71,??

Just a suggestion - the super chilled AC makes the food cold very fast , so we need to figure that out - make the food more warm or make the AC less cooler:)",Rated 4.0,1,20,??
Anviti Shiromany(lady.epicurean),Rated It's a nice African eatery which has great grilled chicken the peri peri sauce makes it even better which was served with your choice of side and I chose garlic bread to go with it. Garlic bread was fine not that great soft and no cheese. I also ordered a chicken burger and potato wedges along with it. The burger wasn't great it was too dry and was bland and cold you actually needed something to gulp it down but the burger bun was fresh and soft. The baseless coke was a good concept and you actually need it when the burger is so dry. The potato wedges were tasty and spicy. Overall I can say just go there for the peri peri grilled chicken.,Rated 3.5,74,476,??

Now dt i did..a great staff welcomed us with a sense of hospitality rare to find in Indian Outlets. So a 10/10 for service.

Being a veggie..we ordered Veg Espetada with hot peri peri and crispy chips..since veg burger was out of stock.(limited optns dt too out of stock, poor word of mouth) 4/10. But woah..it was a delight to see our dish coming in a hanging stand..it took me a few seconds to deconstruct d way i was suppose to have my dish on d platter..bt dt was amazing i must say! So here goes another 10/10 While it seemed like a overly hyped tandoori paneer..dre was nothing unique in d dish so 6/10 but yeah d taste as well as the quality was good. I wouldn't call it a very pocket efficient or price worthy restraunt since neither the dishes lived up to its rapport..nor did the quantity. So may be 4/10.

Akshay Jangra,Rated Nando's is one the finest in CP and provides a special delight to Non vegetarians. First of all the restaurant is simply beautiful. The wooden interiors are very well decorated and the suits the ambience. Now I've been a real fan of peri peri dishes and this place brings out a whole new level of the amazingly spicy sauces. I tried most of the dishes and found them satisfyingly delicious. Expect for the vegetarian ones :p the veg section of the menu is not more than the size of a greeting card. And the dishes are pale compared their non veg counterparts. So if you are a vegetarian and want to try Nandos? Back off man :p *strictly non veg*,Rated 4.5,96,472,??

Anju,"Rated Nandos has a very welcoming vibe - it was an impulse stop, to get out of the rain (Delhi in the rains - delicious!), and I definitely think the warmth of the interiors had something to do with our choice. We had the chicken tenders and the All Together Now platter (Spiced olives, hummus and vegetable dip with pita) - the Peri Peri chicken of course was delicious - please trust the hot-o-meter, it has Indian levels in mind! The platter wasn't too great - I like my pita toasted and crisp, this was soft. The hummus was very good, though. I wanted chamomile tea, which they were out of, sadly, but made up for it with a cuppa of hot cocoa. Service was very good. Stop here if you're stuck in CP in the rain!",Rated 3.5,3,1,??

I tried only their veg dishes which were roasted veg dip, classic veggie wrap with grilled veg as sides and roasted veg & grilled paneer (it was a rice dish).

We ordered veg platter, pita with hummus, grilled chicken wrap, black mushroom burger, citra, citrus bliss, refresh mint and ice tea. The drinks were fine but the rest of the food was disappointing. The chicken and paneer both were undercooked. Only thing I could vote for is french fries and may be for the presentation, rest was no where near to my expectations.

The chicken served is always done to perfection and is tender enough for us to binge.Having said that, the dining experience is a tad bit disappointing.

Abhishek Bhalla,"Rated Having eaten Nandos from where it all started from, I had my pre judgments about the outlets here in India. Nevertheless, the undying (Punjabi) love for chicken dragged me to the CP outlet last evening. The weather was tailor made and we went a wee bit early in the night, say about 7 and got ourselves a nice seating on the top floor with a window view. Check. The spiral ceilings with the neon lamps caught my eye. And well, the roasted chicken smell got us hungry. For starters, we went for the classic Hummus with Pita bread with some lemon iced tea. Note: they serve Peri Peri Hummus with Pita so if you want the original hummus(with a splash of olive oil) you'll need to specify it and they obliged happily. Hummus was freshly made with a hint of tang. The slightly roasted Pita bread gets full marks from me. For mains: we went for Butterfly chicken and The new entry: Espetada Carnival. The butterfly chicken was a well cooked crisp chicken breast. Nothing out of the ordinary. Satiated the meat craving though. The winner was definitely the Espetada Carnival! 5 pieces filled with Feta cheese and parsley on a skewer. Definitely earned all the brownie points. Worth a try. Got us all kinds of joys. Quick service and a courteous staff. Check. Bill came down to about 1300 with the tip. Wasn't so bad after all. Go there with an appetite and it'll be worth it. Cheers!",Rated 4.0,2,41,??

The Whole Chicken platter can be given a miss. However, the only disappointment are the siders. The Garlic bread is nothing like garlic bread and the rice is tasteless and under cooked. The Coleslaw isn't bad. But not good either. The deli is clean and hygienic of course. The ambience is contemporary. The wait staff is very cooperative and helpful.

The classic veggie wrap was such a big disappointment, it was cold moreover it was only filled with coleslaw, Tasted more like a regular coleslaw sandwich . Refresh mint was no better, it tasted pathetic. The chicken was fine but not really impressive, spicy rice as side was also disastrous. Overall really disappointed.

The veg experience was not that great; the taste though, was very different. Service: It was fine. The staff seemed to be in a rush. I think I expected a better service. The plates were presented hot (I don't like the idea of hot plates). The water they served was not cold and they had put ice-cubes to cool it down. Ambience/Seating: The interiors are nothing new. It's very common. They have a ground floor seating and an upstairs seating area. The lights are good, though. The seating is somewhat clumsy. Value for money: It's not very expensive.

The garlic breads are thr most awful ones i have consuned in my life till now. 5 Chicken wings are just good enough - nothing great.

Also, I had gone with a friend who didn't feel like having chicken due to the heat and I realized that this is one place where you should never ever bring your vegetarian friends. Ever. Unless they are happy with just wedges and coke. My friend ordered a classic veggie burger and was just not impressed. We did have the three bean salad and we both totally loved that!

GoogleChrist,"Rated One of the best places to hang out with your friends and family if you have a good appetite for a wholesome non-vegetarian food experience. Excellent staff, awesome ambience, and yummilicious chicken. It was my 3rd or 4th visit at this restaurant, and this particular outlet exceeds the one at Vasant Kunj by many a miles (only the location and ambience, food quality is excellent there too) We ordered one and a half portion of peri peri chicken, a portion of garlic bread with spicy rice, French fries, potato wedges and 3 portions of Portuguese roll. While the chicken was tender and juicy, its crust was well marinated and crispy. Garlic bread was good as well. All in all a foodgasmic outing when you are accompanied by friends and family.

Shubhangi Goel,"Rated When I have to meet my friends, usually I'm the one starting the research for food joints where I haven't been before. Yesterday I was looking for a quiet place that serves good Chicken for I had to catch up with a friend of mine after a long time. She's my Chicken buddy. Since I work in Cyber City, Nando's of Cyber Hub has always fascinated me and it was on my bucket list. So during my research yesterday only I got to know that it's in CP as well. I was more than happy and somehow few pictures on Zomato gave me a feeling that it's not-so noisy place, so I picked up this place for our evening meet. We reached the place around 5:30pm. I saw few beautiful lamps hanging upstairs, so we immediately went to their first floor and grabbed the corner most place. I must say that their seating is comfy, music pleasant and staff really friendly and enthusiastic. Initially, we ordered their famous 'Peri Peri Grilled Chicken' with mild spices and Cheese Garlic Bread. The guy serving us basically guided us regarding their spice-o-meter and advised us to go for +1 or +2 combo that was obviously more pocket friendly. We couldn't decide on our beverages initially so we told him that we're gonna take some time. He was patient enough and probably he sensed our dilemma in decision making when he approached us for guidance after which we ordered a bottomless Sprite and a 'Rosa Fresca'. When 'Cheese Garlic Bread' came to our table, we were quite disappointed as it was mere Pav Bread toasted with a cheese slice. It was surely not 'Garlic Bread'. We told the same to that guy who was serving us and were glad to see that we didn't have to make a request even once as he smilingly asked us to order another side in its replacement. That's when we ordered their 'Peri Peri Wedges' and we were quite happy with it as they were crispy enough and tasted really well with Peri Peri masala sprinkled over them. Then came the Chicken and our drinks. Peri-Peri Chicken was tender, cooked properly and just as spiced up as we wanted it to be. 'Rosa Fresca' was really refreshing and looked beautiful. We found it not-so expensive also. Our bill came out to be around 1000 for 2 which is decent enough. Altogether, We had a great evening and I'm definitely planning to dine in here again with my other Chicken buddies. Suggestions: Firstly, I would suggest them to either improve their garlic bread or remove it from their menu because that's definitely not how garlic bread smells like. Secondly, if you could improve your music playlist- more blues, jazz, classics. That's because good music with good food complement really well and this combination can take one's experience to a different level altogether.",Rated 4.0,14,309,??
Neelendra Nath,"Rated To Nando's I took my friends for my birthday treat! I have been to Nando's before in KL and it was amazing. And, so it was this time. I have been in love with their Peri Peri Chicken since 2011 and it was served exactly the way I had eaten it thousands of kilometres away 4 years ago. That is consistency, and I give it to them. If you are a spicy chicken fan, this is the place. They have set up a nice ambience in there and staff is pretty good. It is not too expensive, but yes a little heavy on the wallet. This is one place every non vegetarian foodie must go!",Rated 4.5,112,365,??
Srijan Jhingan,"Rated This joint was on my wishlist for a very long, but finally tried out the place with my mom a few days back for lunch. Now the interesting part about the food (read chicken) is cooked in the traditional Peri Peri sauce(s). A blend of chillies, oregano, citrus, onion, pepper and some other fancy spices, the Peri Peri adds a unique taste and dimension to the food. The place is well known for its chicken, so vegetarian options are scarce. The chunky, tender chicken, cooked to perfection, is the star here. First impressions - the place, moderately crowded was pretty spacious, dual floor seating, interesting interior decor (the ceiling design is a looker). Service was nice and quick. Do refer to the end of the menu cards for a brief history about the artwork Nando's procures across the world. Every piece of artwork donned by the walls is an original work promoting the rich culture, history and colors of the South African tradition. Anyways, concentrating on the center of the universe here - The all high and mighty grilled peri peri chicken. Found the ""Full Platter"", under the Sharing Platter extremely economical. A full chicken served with 4 regular sized side dishes (chose spicy rice, peri wedges, grilled veggies and garlic bread). The options for the sides are many - coleslaw, peri chips and corn on the cob being others. The chicken was heavenly !! Grilled to perfection with a mouth watering glaze of spices and exotic seasonings, you get to decide the degree of heat ie. the spiciness they give to the chicken. Since I like my food hot and my beer cold, extra spicy it was ! The service was reasonably prompt. Finally, when the food arrived, my taste buds went into a state of trance. It was as if the tender and succulent chicken was falling off the bone The side The side dishes were good too, if not extra ordinary. Moral of the story is - peri peri chicken is their trump card.Topped off the meal with a creamy cheese cake. Great taste ! My mom, the cheese cake connoisseur, gives it a big thumbs up. Now according to many it ultimately boils down to the prices. Many (before trying this out) might say that its overpriced. But when you see the portions, the quality and high standards of the franchise, you don't feel cheated. The meal cost us 1559 bucks, enough portions to skip dinner for that night. All in all, a great tryout for those pining for chicken with an exotic twist. Next time I'm laying siege to the impressive variety of burgers and wraps...:)",Rated 4.5,91,505,??

Rashi Chandra,Rated I went here for the first time yesterday for lunch with some friends. We were about 5 people and we ordered the Meal Platter which is for 2 people. 2 Regular side dishes (or 1 large side dish) and bottomless soft drinks are complimentary. The Meal Platter's quantity was really good. 4 of us couldn't finish it. I will have to try the chicken in 'Extra Spicy' as 'Hot' wasn't spicy enough to for me. The sides were okay. I didn't like the Garlic Bread they served and would like them to make it more toasty and flavourful. It seemed very dry. The staff was helpful and efficient. The decor was nice. We were seated quite comfortably although I wish there was slightly more space between my sofa and the table. I'm pretty sure someone more overweight than me might have problems sitting on that seat.

This big of a joint, and expecting to run things on one card machine? Well, next we get an average seating. Average in terms of size. But it is fine. We ordered simple stuff, their 'hot' peri-peri chicken pieces and so called Chicken Espetada. From Indian standards, their hot sauce was not so hot! Espetada had perhaps more cream than what we were expecting and the chicken peri-peri was not so juicy. May be because of the rush, the chicken either got more grilled than required or might have not used the fresh chicken pieces. Overall, an average experience.

The chicken tasted really good (we ordered one full chicken and its good for 3 people atleast). Note that the choice of peri peri also have a say in how ur chicken will taste.

Anoop Kamath,"Rated First time I tried Nando's was in London in the summer of 2007. Since then I was waiting for the global chain to set shop in India. Nando's was started globally only in 1987 in Johannesburg mining suburb Rosettenville in South Africa. This Mozambiquan/Portugese food chain has become extremely popular with casual diners. Nando's now operates about 1,000 outlets in 30 different countries. After the Mumbai launch, they set shop in Bangalore. But when I tried the Bangalore Nando's, I was a tad disappointed. But that was not the case with Nando's Delhi. Seven of us visited Nando's in Connaught Place around 9.00 pm and we were immediately ushered to the first floor. Before taking the table, I ordered a fresh lime soda and it was there on the table within 5 minutes. We ordered a Jumbo Platter which came with 5 sides. So we ordered 2 fries, 1 corn on cob, one spicy rice and one coleslaw. We also ordered a Chicken Ceaser Salad, Chicken Livers with Portugese Roll and Strips and everything was served within no time (about 15 minutes). We also ordered few drinks Vodka, Bloody Mary, Breezer, Beer and coke and the table looked impressive before we could dig in. The peri peri marinated grill chicken was excellent slightly crispy on the outside and moist inside. The portions were adequate and filling. We ordered hot and added a little peri peri sauce to make it extra spicy. The sauce is good with the spicy rice also. The chicken livers and the Portugese roll also is quite filling and tasty. I thought the chicken livers give another dimension to the taste. The service and ambiance was good too!

Navratna Ojha,Rated Three weeks back on my last visit to Delhi I had the first opportunity to try Nando's here. I have been a big fan of this Afro-Portuguese chain and after visiting it in Bangalore & Dubin(Ireland) the bar was set very high. They didn't disappoint useither. Peri-peri(sweet & sour) is the specialty of this place though some restaurants have already started copying it but the authentic peri-peri is a trademark of the Nando's. My friend & I wanted to grab something quick as I had a flight to catch so we quickly rested with a veg & a non-veg burger and a couple of drinks. After the first bite the expression on my friend's face who was a first time visitor to nando's said it all. Priceless!!! I was a little disappointed as they didn't have beers at that moment but it was easily forgivable. Service was classy & brilliant as they kept asking about the food and the experience.

Deepti Kumra,"Rated I have been dying to try the CP outlet of Nandos and finally got a chance to do that! First of all, it is a little pheeka as compared to their vasant kunj outlet. The seating arrangement, the interiors.. Everything seems slightly better at their other outlet. Although I am yet to try the Cyber Hub one.. With the theme of African Peri Peri Flavours, Nandos has been gaining a lot of popularity in Delhi. I went there on a saturday during lunch time and it was absolutely jam packed. I was lucky enough to get the last table and did not have to wait. Ambiance: the ambiance is great although. Foreigners, couples, families, friends.. You will find everyone here. Service: the service was fast and the staff was very efficient and very friendly. Food: Espatada Carnival (3.5/5): Their espatada carnival is going on where they serve you chicken thighs stuffed with cheese and you can choose 2 sides and 1 drink or desert along with it at a pretty reasonable price. I was very excited to try this. Me and my friend ordered fries and bean salad with one mocktail. The three bean salad served with it was not good. It was too sweet and had too much water in it for some strange reason. The mocktail was good although I can not recall its name. Coming to the chicken, it was fine. Some pieces were really tasty but some pieces were very hard and I couldn't chew them properly. The sauces: I had ordered the extra hot peri peri but they still serve you with more sauces. The extra hot peri peri sauce is not as spicy as you think it is so if you are used to of eating even a little bit of spice, this sauce wont give you a very hard time. Hot peri peri sauce was the best according to me. It had the perfect flavours and I loved it. Medium peri peri- It was a little more saltier than other sauces and you can combine extra hot peri peri with this to enjoy your meal.. 6 Piece Chicken Wings (5/5): Totallyy Awesome!

Shayak Victor Munshi,"Rated I was here for the very first time yesterday afternoon 23rd May and I was suggested to try Esteda Carnival special which in my opinion was a disaster and ended up eating crap and wasting money. The chicken wasn't well marinated and was to hard and fibrous to cut with fork and knife but I managed somehow and my index finger was aching very badly. The potato wedges were too starchy as they use ready to fry frozen variety which was again a turn off as it was no joy in eating it,all fast food companies use frozen stuff but not bad quality as you guys do. You must do something to improve the quality of wedges. The 3 bean salad was a taste disaster and there was no seasoning and was very bland.I asked for sprinkling of pepper but in my opinion a dash of lime with salt could have fixed apart from pepper. This was the only good thing that I had the mango sangria but it lacked in quantity of chopped fruits in it not that I was expecting a floating fruit salad in a glass but again 2-3 pieces wasn't that generous. There is no wifi which was not good and phone signals inside arent that good to connect online. I have shared my feedback on the card after meal and also with the restaurant manager on duty Mr.Jaideep. Hopefully I will return someday as I have to get stamps on the loyalty card stamped and redeem as I am die hard chicken fan.

Harsimran Singh,"Rated After my visit to this place last year, I was intended to give this place a second try. Me and my friend were extremely hungry and were also remembering our last time here. We were greeted by their courteous staff and we sat in the booth... Ambience : 3.5/5 The place is well lit and some paintings are on the wall, the place looks vibrant. Although, I believe there could be more space between the tables upstairs to make the place feel less cluttered. Staff/Service : 4/5 The staff is very generous and knowledgeable. They always give ideas how and what to order and what to expect from it. They ask if we are satisfied by the meal... Service is swift and the presentation is quite good. Food : 4/5 Ravenous, we ordered quite some dishes: We ordered for Hot Peri-Peri in all our dishes. 1. Chicken Breast Fillet BURGER : The burger was really good and spicy. 2. Moroccan Butternut Chicken Fillet PITA : The taste was fresh and juicy, the pita was really soft. Tasted real nice. 3. Espetada Carnival Skewer : It was creamy Peri-Peri chicken on a skewer. It was served with a side of fries and coleslaw which tasted fresh. 4. With these dishes, we ordered a draught beer, Citrus Blast & Citra. All these were amazing. 5. In the end, we ordered a cup of Americano for each of us. However, the card machine they had stopped working and we somehow had to manage the cash.

That being said, it tasted very different (in a good way) from what we get generally at other restaurants. Portions are small and sides aren't complementary (why!!) so you end up paying as much as any other fine dining place. Nando's has the ambience of a take out place but food priced like fine dining. The service was good. I sat near the central air vent which made the chicken cold very quickly (that was my mistake though). Wedges and coleslaw were really good.

Moving ahead we chose the Extra Hot 9 Chicken Wings Platter along with Fries, Potato Wedges, Spiced Rice and the 3 Bean Salad.

We ordered the regular peri-peri chicken along with it along with more drinks (a mojito and a kiwi cooler). The quantity of the food was perfect and we were quite satisfied with our order (being first timers here). The flavors were delectable. The sauces added a zingy taste to the food.

Saurabh Gupta,"Rated Nando's is a south African restaurant which serves Portuguese food. One of the rare places in the capital where you get such a cuisine. The ambience of this place is modern kind of setting with damp lighting. Along with it the restaurant has great canvas paintings which add a lot to its aesthetics. A place to be for a fine dinner. The gentry of the place is very classy. The food is outstanding. I would say this is the place for people who handle little spicy food. A paradise for chicken lovers. Nothing beats their peri peri chicken. The favourite dish is the espatada carnival (pic attached), a must try dish. The dish is highly innovative and would be a temptation for the taste buds. The peri peri sauces are extremely high on flavours, you won't find such a stuff anywhere. The authentic Peri peri joint. For the sides try the three bean salad (amazing stuff) and the corn on the cob. The food is presented beautifully. The restaurant is highly innovative with the drinks too. The special drinks are a must try. The mango cooler is simply great. Never had such a mango drink anywhere. The service these guys delivers is so damn good. The time taken was exactly the same steward committed which shows highly professionalism. The best part is you don't have to call the steward just lift your eyes up and there would be a guy to help you. The place is comparatively highly priced but the irony is you would love to shell out more money by the food and service you get there. Experience was simply great. Big time loyal to the place.

Arunav Roy,"Rated I visited this place on a Saturday with a friend and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't too crowded. The Connaught place branch is quite big containing two levels of seating which makes the seating arrangements quite spacious. Once seated, the guy waiting on our table explained us about the sort of food the place serves (grilled, fat free, Portuguese cuisine) and what they are famous for (their peri peri sauce). Coming to the food, we were informed that the Espetada carnival was going on, so I ordered the carnival special and my friend ordered a mildly spiced Peri Peri chicken roll. The carnival special was a dish containing five pieces of grilled chicken thigh with feta cheese, parsley and bell peppers skewered on an upended metal rod. I had the option of choosing two side dishes and a mocktail with the chicken, so I had asked for potato wedges and the mixed bean salad along with a 'mango sangria'. My friend ordered a glass of bottomless coke. The chicken thigh pieces were quite delicious with the Peri Peri flavor coming out well and you could taste the muted flavors of parsley and cheese. It wasn't sickeningly heavy but filling at the same time. The roll tasted nice too with the dough used in the roll being quite fresh and the chicken tasting soft and nice, however I liked the carnival special more. The mocktail was more like a watered down version of mango frooty, not that i diskiked it but it wasnt as unique or authentic as appeared on the menu. Among the side dishes, the potato wedges were really nice, they were done just right with not being too over burnt. They tasted amazing when dipped in Peri Peri sauce. I found the mixed bean salad to be okay but my friend thought it was a bit sweet, which I did feel was the case, so that was a bit of a disappointment. For dessert, we ordered a slice of carrot cake. It was soft but had good consistency and tasted great. The cinnamon flavor only added to its appeal, which is quite remarkable as I generally dislike that flavor. All in all, the food was very good and filling, and not too expensive at the prices they were being offered (the entire meal was within Rs.1500).

Vishal Garg,"Rated It's been a long time that I had first visited Nando's at their Chandigarh outlet and their peri peri thing completely bowled me out. My friends had never tried their peri peri chicken so yesterday, I got a chance to try their CP outlet. A big one with seating on the ground floor and the mezzanine one. On Sunday night you can expect a waiting but luckily we had to wait for not more than 5 minutes. As you enter the place, you can smell what are you headed for. So we ordered 4 portions of 1/4 chicken because we all wanted different spice levels. You can always go for a whole chicken in which you will 4 pieces but of the same spice level. They have 4 spice levels: extra hot, hot, mild and lemon & herb. So we went for all 4. :-p As expected, the chicken was perfectly grilled and yet so soft. I had gone for the lemon one which was the least spicy and this lemon had actually moved up the taste. I would suggest go for a milder one because you always top it up with their peri peri sauce. My friends who can actually eat hot chillies didn't find their extra hot, at all spicy. They actually topped it up with some peri peri sauce. So you can go for their extra hot as well, it's not at all scary. Also, try out their espeda carnival. A new dish on their menu with 5 stuffed chicken pieces hanging in a stew served with some grilled vegetables. The staff was good and amicable. They had all the information which you would require while ordering the dish. The only thing that bothered was the service. They were quick only in serving the dish. But if you ask for water or for check or anything else they will make you wait until and unless you ask it for 3-4 times. Overall, for me it's a 4.5/5 for the taste.

Food Abuse,"Rated People and businesses have USPs (unique selling prepositions) like great taste, fast service, best breads and so on but you would hardly find a place that advocates 1 particular chilli sauce at its USP. Thats the case with Nandos, the South-African chain with Portuguese/Mozambique theme and flavour. The place thrives on Peri-peri or African birds eye chilli sauce, which is very mild to Indian standards but yet very flavourful. One popular misconception about the place is that it originated in Portugal, but in fact it started from Johannesburg, South Africa when Portuguese Audio engineer Fernando Duarte took his entrepreneur friend Robert Brozin to a small takeaway joint called Chickenland & Brozin bought the place for around 25,000 USD back in 1987 renamed it to Nandos on his friends name and as of now the chain has more than 100 outlets in more than 30 countries, The rest, as they say, is all history. Not long ago the chain debuted in F block, Connaught place and when I got here it was few minutes past 3 and I still had to wait, which gives you a fair idea of how is it doing. I got cozy on the 1st floor and placed my order of Peri- peri chicken (which is a must for obvious reasons) with macho peas, Moroccan butternut & grilled pepper with chicken fillet in a pita, a vegetable wrap with corn-on-the-cob and some Portuguese lemonade. The service is tuned to handle masses with complete ease; my food was plated on the table in just under 10 minutes, all in one go. The Peri Peri was excellent with sublime chilli rubbed all over it and grilled to perfection; it was very juicy and scrumptious in taste. The Portugese Lemonade carried a hint of African Bird Eye Chilli added to a normal lemonade which gives it all the more flavours but the downside is all across the globe and even when they lauched the same thing in 2010 in Malad, Bombay they had a free refill for any drink which is not being followed now. It was quiet a attraction for the majority of Indian who dine out. Next in line was chicken with grilled pepper and butternut in pita. For anybody confused over butternut, its just a breed of pumpkin. The most striking part about this was the pita; it was so fresh that it was semi-moist and worked so well with that great chicken. The vegetarians are not totally ignored here but I certainly didnt expect the vegetarian food to be a complete winner and the case was same as the spices were slightly on higher side in the veg wrap. The Peri-Peri had a certain aftertaste and heat to it, which I was unwilling to leave for as long as I could, hence I completely gave up the idea of trying dessert here. For any chicken lover, this is the place to be rather than a KFC or Mc-Donalds. The chicken is so fresh that it clearly speaks quality in itself, although at a price higher than other QSR chains. secondlastsupper.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,125,309,??

Neha Chowdhury,"Rated Went to Nando's after ages, having tried it for the first time in Mumbai. This time my dad was with me and he is a serial foodie himself! Since he had never come here before, the ordering was left upto me which rarely ever happens when he is around. I ordered the Peri Peri pita with hummus, portuguese salad with chicken and a half chicken with sides. Pita and hummus with the peri peri was a twist on the traditional pita hummus combo, but I would prefer the traditional one over this since the peri-peri doesn't do much to the flavour. The portuguese salad was fresh and juicy and the chicken is standard with your choice of the sauce which in our case was hot Peri PEri since i cant handle spicy food. Overall it only makes sense to go here if you are a chicken enthusiast Needless to say any of my Nando visits are incomplete without their portuguese lemonade which I enjoy immensely. Ambiance is noisy but what else can you expect at a crowded place in CP on a weekend. Obviously there is enough waiting to build up your appetite by the time you are seated so plan in advance.",Rated 3.5,12,439,??

We ordered 1/2 Chicken with hot Peri Peri, Pita Bread with Hummus, Red Sula Wine, and Mojito. The problem we faced here could be a one-time thing. We were given a table near the glass window on the ground floor and there was many mosquitos. They finally moved when we complained for the third time.

Altamash Aslam,Rated The food is really average. The only thing wprth eating is their piri piri sauce. The mild spiced chicken was almost bland. Despite telling them to bring the hottest chicken it was not that spicy. The spicy sauces made it edible. The 3 bean salad was really good. The portuguese lemonade was average. The quantity of chicken was really good though. The place was neat and clean and the ambience was good as well. Disappointed with the food.

Rishabh Verma,"Rated Dinner at Nando's, that was the plan for a Sunday night. After waiting in line for about 25-30 minutes, surrounded by a few polite people, we were lead to a cozy looking corner table on the first floor. The interior is amusing, with wavy pretty lights hanging and the open kitchen to see the grills being worked on. Getting down to it, we only wanted their prized possession, the Peri-Peri smothered bird. Our server was friendly, and took our order of a Full Platter with 4 reg sides without a hold-up. The food took a while to reach us, letting us get our drink on. The chicken was nice and warm, and the sides equally refreshing. We chose the Three Bean Salad, Coleslaw, Fries and Wedges as add-ons. The sauces in olive oil styled bottles were hot and tangy; I liked the Wild Herb one. But, one whole chicken is definitely not big enough, should be rewritten as can be shared between two only instead. For my conclusion, it's not as sensational as it's made out to be. I guess it was all the hype that expanded my expectation. Maybe the Carrot Cake will be the savior of your meal, as it was for mine.",Rated 3.0,50,203,??

Finger & Fork,"Rated My love affair with Nando's began in London. An affair which still prompts me to buy their lemon and herb sauce every time I am at nature's basket. I visited their CP outlet this valentines as we could not find a place at cafe warehouse. It was a nearly done place buzzing with a lot of family crowd. We were given a table in the seating area upstairs and had someone wait on us right after. We ordered a lemon and herb chicken fillet wrap with Moroccan butternut and peppers and a mild peri peri chicken filet wrap with sides of fries and wedges. To drink we picked refresh mint and a Portuguese lemonade. The chicken filet was well done and was generously filled in the wrap. I am not too fond of butternut but somehow the combination didn't seem bad at all. The classic chicken fillet wrap was a delight ad always. The drinks were slightly disappointing both of them being high on sugar. The service was average and parts of it hasty to accommodate the waiting customers. They had issues with card payment that day so we had to pay in cash. All in all a good experience marred by the minor sugar rush they tried to give us. That's all I have on Nando's for now.

Now coming to food,we ordered the platter for two,it had a whole chicken, two regular fries ? and bottom less drinks. The chicken was ordered in hot category. The food was on our table in about 15 mins. The chicken was awesome, the flavours went inside the meat very well. But some portions were burnt according to me which ruined the fantastic taste. But that was for a small portion of meat so I ignored it. The drinks are unlimited so nothing to say for that and the fries were good too. Just to mention the sauces they provide is way out of the league, it was the best sauce I ever had.

Now coming to the alcohol, they serve variety of alcohol but the price of the alcohol is bit expensive.This the reason i hav given them 4.5 .

Ravi Sharma,"Rated Nandos!! Coming from mumbai, seeing nandos we were completely filled with excitement!!! There were four outlets in mumbai previously but all of them shit down around 4 -5 years ago. It was a Friday afternoon and the place was busy. The service was lousy. I had to ask four times before somebody could actually come and take our order. Unfortunately they do not have the veggie halloumi Burger which they serve in London! I was expecting the same options. Nevertheless we settled for the veggie pita extra spicy with coleslaw and rice. For starters we ordered the hummus and pita bread. The Food arrived quickly. The hummus was tasting fresh but the pita lacked the freshness which it should have. The veggie pitas was good but even thought I ordered the extra spicy it wasn't as spicy as expected. Obviously they had the extra sauces available which helped to enhance the flavour. The menu options are limited for vegetarians and that's something they should work on.

Siddharth Michael Sudhakar,"Rated Nandos !! In short nandos was satisfying but no wow factor at all.

We order chicken and rice, Moroccan butternut wrap and butterfly chicken breast. All was good. Good kitchen. The fires were well done. But as I said not wow. Satisfying safe bet. Service was fast fast fast. Waiting was huge as it was a sunday. But the waiters were very nice and smiled all along. In short a nice family lunch is good here. But a date or meeting is a no no.

I am a fan of chicken and that's my favorite type of meat. But, I didn't enjoy it much.

Rahul Taluja,"Rated This has been on my to go list since they opened in Vasant Kunj but somehow I have not been able to go here. But then the wait was worth it. The USP is their Peri Peri Chicken, we ordered half a portion, we liked it so much that we ordered another half portion, it was that awesome. Even after that, we wanted more. You have the option to chose sides with the Chicken, I chose Rice and Coleslaw. Rice was just fine but the Coleslaw was definitely good. So it definitely goes at the top of the list of places with best Grilled Chicken, extremely soft, extremely juicy and extremely tasty, we chose the mild Peri Peri. Also had their Cheese Garlic Bread which was different but simple and amazing. Only issue was that card machines weren't working here and one of the servers very casually told me that it's been a month since they worked. Now I would really want to know the bank's name that these guys deal with because I can't think of a bank that would not cater to a complaint like this from a restaurant like this in today's time. Come on guys, these are extremely lame excuses, stop them.

Vaibhav Gautam,"Rated Do I need to say anything about nando's? If you are a chicken lover then this place should definitely be in your list. I've visited this place many times but writing it's review for the first time. I won't say anything about their signature peri-peri chicken because it is proven to be best in its class. I will write something about Espetada Carnival. If you want to compare it to any Indian dish then It looks very much similar to chicken tikka but million times better ( I am in love with chicken tikka too but I would choose it over chicken tikka). It was so soft, Delicious, juicy, perfectly spiced, marinated. When it goes into your mouth it feels like thousands of fairies are playing harp around you and the great Lord is feeding you himself (sorry veggies, you'll never be able to feel this with your ""paneer""). Add some extra hot peri-peri sauce over it and you will find yourself in chicken heaven. Ok to be serious these guys know how to deal with chicken. They know what they are doing. How they are serving and how to spice up things. Everything was perfectly spiced, balanced and leaves a perfect flavour in your mouth. Chicken is soft and juicy like it should be and tastes great. If you love chicken then you should definitely visit this place once and i challenge you that it won't be your last visit. I could have rated 5 stars but 4 because of the sides which they serves with Espetada Carnival. It doesn't blends well chicken. The waiter mixed our drinks and otherwise everything was good.

We had to wait for 30 minutes to get a table for two, but the guys from Nando's were extremely courteous and ushered us to the table irrespective of the mad rush of crowd in the restro. The interior was decent with lots of delicate wooden work hanging from the ceiling. However the seating was not that comfortable. Coming to the food - Nando's is famous for their Peri Peri Chicken and we made no exception in our selection. We ordered a Meal Platter which had 1 whole chicken (4 mega portions of chicken wings) , 1 large portion of french fries and 2 bottomless drinks with unlimited refills. The chicken was tender to the core with perfectly seasoned crust. Word of caution - if you do not have a large appetite, you should ideally share this platter among 3.

Being Valentine's Day I decided to treat a few of my family members for lunch and as Nando's is my aunts favourite we decided to try out the CP outlet. Made the worst decision ever to go there! The staff is inconsiderate, rude, careless and majorly sexist! We were a group of 10 - 7females and 3 males. Initially, I reached the place with my sisters and aunt to take a table. They gave us a table on the firsts floor for 5 when we asked for a table for 10 and when questioned they gave us a table of 2, probably just to get rid of the question. Now comes the main part, we asked them to join the table and they said they can't do so its against their policy, then I asked them to just add chairs as the table is good enough to add a few more chairs and we were ready to accommodate the remaining, they again refused. Then we decided to order, the first thing the waiter says is 'Just so you know, we don't accept cards', informing us was fine but he informed us in a tone no one would have appreciated. After nearly 15 minutes the same waiter came and took the chair from the table of 2 which was supposedly given to us, I again questioned why did he do that, to my surprise he IGNORED my question and didn't bother at all! This time I lost my cool, I started to question the guy, first nicely then I just had to shout as the way he was looking at me was disrespectful and totally unacceptable. I would have simply slapped that guy if my brothers wouldn't have reached on time. Seeing guys on the table, the waiters attitude changed drastically. My brother asked me what's the matter then spoke to the waiter. That guy told us he shall accommodate us downstairs on the ground floor in 5 minutes. We agreed! But all of a sudden, I see him come to the table and join the other table which initially he refused to do! It was very evident he did so because he realised we had guys with us too. I asked him how was it possible now he bluntly walked off! I have never been disrespected this way ever! It was the worst dining experience of my life. I've never raised my voice in a restaurant before. The food though was agin sad! The chicken looked dry as told to me by others. I had the veggie pita which too lacked flavour! The only saving grace were the drinks and the Choco cake. P.S.- Is there anyway I can voice my complaint in a way it reached the concerned authorities? Furious as ever!",Rated 1.0,40,291,??
Joel George,"Rated Nandos... Hmmm.. had heard a lot and had high expectations! And that's probably a bigger reason to my strictly average rating, if not for which i wud have been a bit more generous. The food is... Meh.. I've had chicken.. a lot.. from a lot of places, and in a lotta styles. This wasn't bad. But is simply wasn't good enough to deserve the kind of ""nandos specialty signature dish that'll blow ur mind"" status that it has, especially not when it's a thousand bucks. The drinks menu is misleading. I ordered a beer and no where is it mentioned that they're serving the 330ml bottle. No wonder I found the prices to be too good to be true. It's my fault I didn't ask and confirm first, so I didn't bother reacting when they served it. But on the other hand, this isn't my first rodeo - when u serve drinks u mention the sizes as applicable.. anyways.. that's that. And finally the service. A few ppl can really spoil it for an outlet actually, sometimes even 1person.the guy at the door can be summed up as clueless. Thank god for the other more enterprising staff, and for the sheer will of the customers to have their food , or their footfall would be halved!

W ordered full meal platter for two which has a full chicken with our choice of mild peri peri sauce, side dishes were corn on the cob, french fries and grilled vegetables. Now comes the main part ie taste of the food which was not too much of my liking, french fries were too bland, chicken was fulfilling, chicken was well cooked and the chunks were very soft and nice and as the quantity was just right for two or three people t like it but i did not like it very much, grilled vegetables were normal but yes i liked their peri peri sauce.

This isn't the best Nandos outlet but I have to say its better to have a bad Nandos outlet than to have no Nandos outlet at all.

Tulika Sharma,"Rated I loved the peri peri chicken of Nandos when I first tried it at their vasant kunj outlet and I was pretty excited when I saw their coming soon board around CP. I waited eagerly for the cp outlet to open and visited within 2-3 days of its opening only to get disappointed. My experience with the staff was pretty bad and ruined our meal. The cp outlet is spread across two floors and when I visited the place was quite full on ground floor. I saw empty seats on the first floor so I started moving towards the stairs and suddenly one of staff came running and spread his hands around and blocked my way and very rudely said there are no seats available upstairs. When I said I can see the seats are empty he says I am getting you seats downstairs. Within minutes one of the tables got empty and we sat there but the incident spoiled my mood. We ordered for a full platter which had a whole chicken and 4 regular sides (fries, spicy rice, coleslaw and corn on the cob) along with Madeira red and citrus bliss. The order arrived timely and we dig into it. The chicken turned out to be pretty average with not enough spices and was not even close to the vasant kunj outlet and disappointed us even further. The drinks were refreshing and sides were the only saving grace. With so many options around CP, average food and a pathetic staff, I will definitely not visit Nandos at CP again.

Neat is the word which comes to mind here when you enter. Amiable staff, large open space, and of course the food was really good. Since I was trying the menu for the first time I ordered some peri peri chicken with lime sodas. Well the chicken was different but extremely well cooked. Not a hint of laziness in the cooking. The staff is well trained and really attentive. Going with your family or friends Nando's will make you happy to say the least. The only thing is that the cuisine is a little unique and you may not adjust to the taste quickly. The sauce which they give with the chicken is extremely unique and tasty. All in all a great experience and would love to visit again to explore their menu more. Price is slightly on the higher side but I guess they cover up for it mostly.

The seating on the ground floor is a more preferable option because our table on the first floor was too close the other tables and a bit uncomfortable. A order is quick and efficient , however a quick note of Caution, they don't serve the same piece of your choice if you want a repeat, I.e, if you want another thigh piece after your first, you can't have it. At least this is what the somewhat rude waiter told us. The food was alright, almost alike to their other branches. The waiters needed to be given 3 reminders about the refills of the coke.

First the ambience. Situated near palika bazaar this outlet of Nando's has a nice ambience with large tables and larger seats. There was nice music playing and overall was impressive. The service was quick and the staff courteous. Now to the main agenda. The food. We tried half chicken and espetada carnival along with spicy rice and three bean salad as side. None of them was as spicy as they claimed and even the sauces that we tried which were the medium and hot sauces were not upto the mark with respect to the spiciness. The chicken was well cooked and the espetada was different in taste in a good way but the end result demanded more spice as that was the only reason that i went to this outlet,Rated 3.5,15,43,??

Aparajita Chattopadhyay,"Rated Nando's is definitely one name that doesn't need much introduction if you are a chicken lover so when I hear about their second outlet in Delhi I knew I had to visit them and well the location couldn't have been any better, the heart of Delhi- Connaught Place. In terms of the ambiance of the place, as soon as you enter the restaurant, the beautiful wooden stairs and bright overhead light fixture catch your attention. I loved the cozy and warm feeling the dim lighting, the pretty painting and the pastel walls gave to the place. The restaurant is divided into two floors- both floors have quite spacious seating but the highlight of sitting on the ground floor is the open kitchen. Armed with the company of a hatta-katta (brawny) punjabi sailor boy who is blessed with a rather huge appetite, I ended up trying everything on the menu except of course the vegetarian options and before any one attacks me with the benefits of the vegetarian lifestyle...I love vegetarian food and have nothing against it but I honestly don't see the point of going to Nando's and wasting the precious little space I have in my tummy on anything except chicken :P We started our meal with a salad ( yes we were trying to have something light before we drove into the peri peri chicken world) and we ended up trying the Mediterranean Salad. I like my salads simple and fresh and well that's exactly what the salad was. The salty and tangy taste of the feta cheese complimented the sweetness of the vegetables and the rest of the task of tantalizing the taste buds was handled well by the peppers and the chicken. For drinks we had to choose from mocktails as they hadn't received their bar license yet so no hard drinks. ordered Citrus Bliss and Madeira Red. Both the drinks were recommended by our servers and I have to say I was pretty happy with the drinks. Next we moved to the classic peri-peri chicken. The bong in me urged me to opt for extra hot while the sailor played it a little safe and went with mild. While the chicken was absolutely amazing and cooked to perfection, I think I went a little overboard with extra hot option because when they say extra hot they mean tongue on fire kind of hot. We then decided to try the special from the menu and opted for espetada. The presentation us took by surprise as it was served on a huge vertical skewer which is not something you usually see. The boneless chicken was moist and tender and the thick and creamy coleslaw with crispy fries proved to be the perfect sides to this dish. Next we tried the Moroccan butternut and grilled peppers with chicken fillet burger. The burger turned out to be a little disappointing as the bread absolutely dry and I did not really taste any of the ingredients promised in the menu. By the time we were finished, I had absolutely no space left for desserts however they do have a couple of options on the menu that I would like to try (the choco and the carrot cake) I read alot of negative comments about the service before I visited the place but I guess they have a taken a heed to it as the service at the time of my visit was prompt and the servers are quite polite. I had too many queries about the menu and I have to say not once did I found our server getting annoyed with my questions. On the contrary, he was very helpful and not only gave some really good recommendations but also told us everything we wanted to know about the dish. I know its a little difficult to visit this place as the waiting list goes in the higher end of the double digits but do try....lots of good food always triumphs over a little bit of waiting time",Rated 4.5,11,31,??
P.K.,"Rated I have been to a lot of Nando's outlets all over the world and I have seen that they are always full. Never have I seen one Nandos outlet that is not bustling with people. For some odd reason Nandos is always alive. I think because they have really fresh meat that makes the whole place smell so divine is why people come and keep on coming. I know I love that smell very much. The Peri Peri is surely to die for. I know I love the place, the drinks, the rice, the hummus.

Abhirup Saha,"Rated The day Nando's at CP started serving liquor, turned out to be also the day when we made our first visit. They didn't have the beverages menu printed out yet, so the waiter did the honour of rattling out the names. Opted for a Sula Red and then focused on the main reason we were there for: Them Chicken. One nugget before I get further- my journey with Nando's start years back at Inorbit Mall, Goregaon (W), Mumbai. But when it shut down, it lost a very ardent patron. And then much later, on my visit to Northampton, I succumbed again to its charms. One platter was ordered, with the whole chicken and two large sides; fries and grilled veggies, with the full knowledge one platter amongst 3 of us is not justice. We repeated the order, but next time with grilled veg and mashed beans. The chicken was superbly marinated, as you'd expect with Nando's, soft as ever. The first platter was ""mild"", so it didn't really attack the buds. Going a step further, the next one was ""hot"", which made it an interesting journey. Two of us were chili-averse (including me) so if you have more of a chili hogger, nothing less than ""Extra Hot"" will do. In terms of decor, it is inferior to the Vasant Kunj outlet, with upstairs being a bit weird with pillars positioned all wrong. But I loved the round wooden staircase. It looks a little flimsy, but it is quite sturdy and a light color to the wood probably berefts it of class as a mahogany tan would have. But it probably gives a light touch to the place, more consistent with Nando's brand positioning. Come here for the chicken. And now there's wine, beers and whiskey to help you wash it down.",Rated 3.5,134,473,??

Since we went there on a cold wintry evening..the wooden interiors were quite cosy and welcoming. After deliberating much on the menu as what to order..with some suggestions from their staff...we ordered the signature peri-peri chicken and veggies in pita along with some wedges and fries. To our utter disappointment the chicken was quite limp with just peri-peri sauce thrown over. The veggie in pita. was also just so-so with both of us struggling hard to finish our meal. So to say, it maybe a famous chain creating a buzz amongst youngsters serving exotic Afro or Portuguese dishes..but for us it is a total thumbs down..just plain marketing gimmicks of an over hyped foreign eatery.

Given the place was jam packed the service was extraordinary, after being escorted to your table on the upper level , the server was quick in giving us water and the menu card. The staff's courteous behavior and service is really praise worthy. The ambiance is also outstanding the overhead light fixtures and the wooden installations , the seating very comfortable with a lot of options available on a regular day. As what we wanted to eat was decided beforehand we didnt take time to order. Half of the mild peri peri grilled chicken and a mild espetada with a side of fries and coleslaw , as this was my first visit i wasn't to sure how spicy will the chicken be so went for the safe side. The famous peri peri chicken arrived with an array of different peri peri sauce bottles. Hot , Extra Hot , Medium , Garlic and the Wild herb peri peri. I truly Loved the Garlic peri peri sauce. It's really addicting. The chicken on the other hand was very well done with an aroma that was hard to resist.It was thoroughly marinated and the flavor was till deep inside.

The crispy chicken breast with piri piri sauce was the exact opposite. Soggy and chewy. The manager clarified that they don't fry but grill. So that's why it was not what I expected. They offered to redo it and they did, but the result was not very different. My question is - why write CRISPY!!??Eventually ate a bland piece of limp chicken with soggy skin drowned in hot piri piri sauce.Then I went to the ladies washroom where I had to wait for 15 mins before the door opened and out stepped one of the male servers from Nando's in uniform. Nice! I wasn't pleased to say the least and the manager I spoke to said that he would ask the guy to use the washrooms later. Excuse me, for not being thrilled.

There was a waiting for 15 minutes but I got a seat instantly as we were in a hurry and opted for the high seating right next to the entrance as they were nobody's choice. Ambience is good. Service is highlight of Nando's. Very welcoming staff. There credit card machine was not working but we were informed as soon as we were seated. I was very happy to see chicken livers in the menu now also. I ordered for 1 chicken levers and 1/4 chicken in hot option. Livers had a hot sauce which was just superb. 1/4 chicken was average, but tasted good with the sauce we were served. I would have given 3.5 for the food but .5 extra is for the service.

Prateek Barar,"Rated Ok so after much anticipation I got a chance to visit nando's as it was on my list for a long time. To start with we had to wait for almost 20 min to get a seat. The ambience is really good, mainly wooden n the staircase that takes you to 1st floor is a perfect place to take some photos after your done with your meal. Now coming to the main thing the food, Peri Peri chicken for which nando's is famous is nothing but barbeque chicken with their Peri Peri sauce on top which can be customized as per the hotness of chilly you want. So if you like barbeque chicken you might like this as well. I found it average. Instead the chicken fillet in pita bread & their Portuguese lemonade were really awesome. In fact the lemonade had some different spices in it which enhanced it taste. So all in all an average rating of 3 from my side & this place can be paid one visit just for experience sake if you're not fond of barbeque chicken.",Rated 3.0,67,169,??

It wasn't a fully satisfying experience considering the hype. The chicken was ok, nothing special. The sauce wasn't exactly spicy but more on the tangy sour side. The portugese lemonade was good though! The food just doesn't do justice to the hype and the pricing. Will not be visiting it again most likely.",Rated 3.0,33,121,??
Shubhangi Jain,"Rated If u like kfc type chicken..u should definitely go for this. Tried peri peri chicken in mid hot sauce in combo with potato wedges and spicy rice. Chicken was great. wedges were as they were supposed to be crispy and non spicy but didnt like the rice at all. Actually u have an option to choose 2 dishes from regular menu or 1 from fino menu as part of the combo..so just dont go for spicy rice as part of combo. They serve garlic sauce and hot spicy sauce along with everything..its kept like ketchup bottles on all tables..both were good. All in all a good experience. And peri peri chicken is available in 4 types of sauces..lemon n herb , mid hot, hot, extra hot..i tried mid this tme..was good..nd gonna try hot next.

Now about the chicken... My tastebuds were excited to taste a hot juicy and spicy chicken piece BUT what I got is a normal roasted chicken breast with a bit of peri peri sauce over it. They claim that it has been marinated for 24 hours??? I don't know how come then the chicken was not even tender enough. I like potato wedges more than the chicken.",Rated 3.0,32,15,??
Prabhakar Singh,"Rated Lets be honest, the only reason I know about Nandos is because of the British comedians Russell Howard and Jack Whitehall. They have ranted long (on TV duh) about the awesomeness of peri peri chicken and till now I thought I could only dream about it. Well no more. Finally got my hands on the lemon herb peri peri chicken. With fries and corn cob on the side. I know... Corn cob? With chicken? What was this guy thinking? But it was nice and I don't care. And neither should any one else. For 550+ Rs it is worth it. Chicken is their specialty and they know how to rock it. Lets just say I'll take Nando's over KFC any day. ARE YOU LISTENING COLONEL??? Apart from the usual, there are a lot else to try from. An exhaustive list of beverages, alcoholic and non, are available to go with your meal. If the classic peri peri is not enough for you, then you can have the platter for ~ 1000Rs which is enough to fill up a small family of three, or a fat family of two, or me. Having a meal here gets you a Nando's Loyalty card. where on every third meal you get a discount. It starts with a 1/4th PeriPeri, then 1/2, and so on and so forth. All the more reason to go there. It's a good thing that the Nando's team doesn't expect proof of loyalty from its customers. I don't think I'm quite ready yet for Mafia-esque displays of loyalty.

Dipender Singh,"Rated I have been a big fan of Nandos since 2008 while I was in Australia and since I returned, few things I had left behind there, Nandos was one of them and I use to crave for their juicy, one of the kind grilled chicken. So when the outlet opened in DLF Promenade I was one of the first visitors there. But this review is particularly about this outlet in CP. Let me break it down and bring it out in points: 1) Interior and ambiance: Signature of Nandos. Multi colored walls with those recognizable paintings. Very spacious and has a quintessential uptown restaurant feel to it. 2) Service: One of the most important aspect which separates a great restaurant from an ordinary one. The service from the attendants are courteous and timely. You feel very welcome and each and every aspect about the restaurant, its food is explained to all first time customers. The food is served hot and within promised time. 3) Food: Nandos has a trademark taste to its chicken and this outlet outstandingly lives upto the Nando's tradition. The chicken we ordered was moist and taste was just yumm. The sides that we ordered were also good and I would like to go back to try other sides. All in all a very good and typical Nandos experience. Well done Cheers",Rated 4.5,15,74,??
Nilesh Maiti,"Rated Nandos. Cool as the name says. Espetada, Peri-peri chicken n wraps are too good. The Portuguese flavour leaves a yumm taste in the mouth! Serving is stylish and the ambience creates a jaazzy environment for people getting in. Go out n enjoy Nandos peri-peri style!",Rated 4.0,6,39,??
Karishma Gaur,"Rated Reminiscent from my London Nando's experience, I went in here to get a quick takeaway order. Yes, ambience, mood, decor...all fine and good. Not the point, though. One, the card machine was not working. Really? At a student hub, you expect people to pay 1000-2000 rupees in cash? Two, the burger I tried (the moroccan from the takeaway with two side orders) was below average. The chicken breast was too thick and kinda dry. Salad inside the burger was mealy and the mayo could use another shot. For the sides, I chose fries and sticky rice. Fries were OK but not warm enough for a winter's day and the sticky rice is a boxed version of what your mom would make in poha. Exactly the same, guys, so if you want sticky rice, come home, tell mom and have it as a side! Overall, I spent 465 INR and while this is only about a 100 Rupees more than what I would have spent on a similar sized meal at McDonald's, I would be doubtful to recommend it or try it again. Maybe they have other food that's good, maybe they serve better food in-house. Oh, and also, there were a couple of rather moody staff who were making faces, looking disgruntled and being not a little ****** right at the waiting area where everyone could see. Like, thanks for signing my loyalty card, jackass, and see if I ever use it again!",Rated 2.5,16,26,??
Ridhika Khanna,"Rated Well, after hearing a lot about this place, I got an opportunity to try it out. Staff was quite courteous and they greeted us. We ordered their speciality peri peri chicken and 1 more chicken dish with some filling. It was a very ordinary meal. I did not find anything great as I was told by my friends. I have had far better chicken grills and sauces and this was really below the mark. It is a highly overrated place. I will never visit again!! Also, I must mention that the EDC (card swipe machine) was not working so my friend had to go and withdraw cash. Also read in most reviews that this is a common problem here.

Rush was more so the service took a back seat - our complaint regarding this was accepted and promised to better it.

Sushmita Gupta,"Rated A new place for meat cravers Nandos falls a little short of delivering its promise. Straight away the ambience, buzz, the warmth of staff gets you in the right feel. Seating is well spaced and comfortable. We ordered a meal platter and chicken wings two regulars in the menu. Also a paneer dish for poor me a single veggie from our group of people. My experience of the food was really pathetic. But wasn't really expecting anything else, since it is obviously not a place for veggies. Quite surprisingly my friends also complained of the chicken being dry due to over-cooking and not upto the standard they were expecting, given the exorbitant prices of the place! Single advice. I know you are catering to non-vegetarians only but if u have veg items on the menu please make sure they are atleast edible.",Rated 2.5,16,112,??
Aditya Chawla,"Rated Visited their CP outlet on a cold night with a friend. Its got quite a modern ambience and is located in the heart of CP . We ordered their meal for two which includes 4 pieces of their famous Peri Peri chicken , 2 portions of sides ( we choose corn but coleslaw was also an option ) , a few potato wedges and a cola ( not sure if it was coke or pepsi) which could be refilled as many times as you wish . The server asked us our preferred level of spice . We choose 'Mild' option although we could have gone for another level up . The chicken was nicely grilled and the portion size was decent too . Its actually similar to what I have had at various places on a recent trip to Canada. Personally , I prefer thebchicken cooked from inside too ( Like Tandoori ) and that's coming from a pure Punjabi :P Overall , a good place for those who love their chicken grilled , not tandoored !",Rated 3.0,4,92,??
Kanupriya Singh,"Rated The good things first - the place is spacious and very tastefully decorated, and the staff is absolutely amazing. Now comes the food. When I see a place that specializes in grilled chicken - the very least that I expect is that I get a tender chicken. See, when you get an overcooked, dry chicken in a place like Nando's, which has a reputation and charges for it, that's not the standard you're looking for. We ordered a Butterfly Chicken Breast (Peri-peri) and an Espetada. And both were overcooked. The Portugese Lemonade sure packed a punch but it couldn't make up for the poor main course. Once again, I'd like to appreciate the courteousness of the staff. But I hope they serve better chicken the next time we visit :)",Rated 3.0,60,139,??
Disha,Rated Nandos is like heaven for all non vegetarian people. No doubt the food and variety is amazing. I have been to nandos vk before and i found it better than this in terms of service.

Akshat Gupta,Rated The staff is full of incompetent idiots. The service is worse than a roadside dhaaba. They don't know their own menu. The cashier is busy preparing orders instead of taking them whereas others are gossiping. They made me wait 15mins just to order and then 15mins again to take the payment. Then 10mins again to prepare it. Wow.. Just wow. To top it off these people took the order wrong... Gave me 1/4 chicken breast claiming it to be Peri-Peri Butterfly chicken breast and the icing on the cake still remains. There were bones... Big bones in a boneless chiken breast. Even the taste here is crap compared to the ones in Gurgaon and Vasant Kunj. Never expected this from Nandos. Never going to this outlet again.,Rated 1.0,3,0,??

But .. the chicken here isnt as great as the one in VK. The coleslaw was pretty average as well. The Paneer Rice ( Yes im not joking ) was much better than the chicken.

Even the chicken here tasted better I think! The hot chocolate that we ordered was yummy. The only thing was the coleslaw that needed a little more dressing! Chicken wings were also nice! The herb sauce, which i tried here for the first time, was 'chatpata' in a good way. Can't wait to dig into their succulent, juicy and spicy chicken again!

Shubhda Chaudhary,"Rated Its Nando's. The name is enough. The last time, I ate at Nando's, it was South Africa. This time, the newly opened outlet in CP is well, quite a disappointment. When I recently went there on a Friday evening, in spite of wanting one single seat, I was asked to wait. Later, I had to personally ask the gentleman that I could see vacant seats and thus, I can be allowed to enter. After I sat, alas, they came up to me and said that their card machine does not work. Since, I normally dont carry cash, I had to sadly leave. After two days ( b'coz for my love for Nando's), I took my friends there. I asked the attendant 4 times, if their card machine was working. His reply was affirmative. As we gulped down the first morsel, the waiter came up and apologized saying that their card machine wasn't working. SO, THEIR CARD MACHINE NEVER WORKS. EVER! AND ITS DISAPPOINTING! Even if you want to charge your smart-phone, I bet you would get a socket. They dont do that either. Well, 10/10 for the Nando's in South Africa.

Pakhee Malhotra,"Rated The world famous restaurant opens a new outlet in Connaught Place. Even though my friend has lived many years abroad where Nando's is readily available, he didn't get the opportunity to visit the place. I, on the other hand, have tried and tested the place tons of times in the UK but never in India. So we decided to finally give Nando's a shot to impress us. For people who haven't had the better versions of it in other countries will certainly come to relish the place for good chicken. But I have high standards (yes, I admit, rather bluntly). Now coming towards the gist of if. We reached there for early dinner around 4.30ish. There was a bit of waiting but luckily only 5 to 10 mins. We were ushered to our table and were seated comfortably. For the food we ordered Butterfly Chicken (hot) with side of Coleslaw and Rice, Veggie Burger (extra hot) with sides Corn On Cob and Potato Wedges and some garlic bread with cheese. The portions were massive and filling. The chicken was well cooked however, the burger wasn't too impressive. I can get a lot better options at so many other places in the same price range. However, I found the buns to bd very soft and freshly bakes. The side were very well done too. Apart from this, were ordered a Cheese Cake which was, though creamy and fresh, was overpowered by too muh Cinnamon. Someone tell them to bring that down a notch. The service and ambience was typically the same as it is elsewhere in the world - with either Portuguese or Reggae music playing in the back. All in all a mediocre visit. Piri Piri is new to India so I understand that fad but I doubt I'll be coming here anytime soon. Way better chicken out there.",Rated 3.5,37,80,??

We had to wait for a few minutes, after which one of the staff led us to our table upstairs. The place has a pretty design with a pleasant ambience. We ordered the Portuguese salad and cataplana algarve, both of which were quite delicious!! To try out something new to drink, I ordered the Portuguese lemonade, which I simply loved!!

Pallavi Kaul,"Rated I finally tried the famous nando's peri peri chicken. I'm not a fan of spicy, thus I tried the mild and medium sauces. The chicken is different, tender and full of herbs. Something I would want more of. The espadata was also similar and nice. They have a decent variety of sides to choose from- fries, coleslaw, bean salad etc. thus something for everyone to choose. Although nothing exceptional. Just a decent meal with some nicely herbed tender chicken. Will surely go to the place for more.",Rated 3.0,49,571,??
Ankit,Rated The class of art is now available at cp. The most delicious chicken I've ever ate is at Nandos. The staffs are friendly with exceptional ambiance. They are always in touch to ensure the well being. The only lag is the delayed service. You have to wait approximately 20-25 minutes for your order and for such delicious food it is too much. Overall it is one of the best restaurant in the town.,Rated 4.5,12,61,??
Vaibhav Kashyap,"Rated I am big fan of their iconic peri peri chicken and keep using their sauces at home as well. And so, this always sits amongst my top dining options whenever I happen to be in Vasant Kunj or Cyber hub. The new Nando's outlet at CP is a welcome surprise. Though visiting this restaurant at a Sunday Noon would be big blunder for waiting is at least a good 40 mins! (would never do such a mistake again). But once you get in, the aroma is simply mouth watering. It is so refreshing and thus has to be an absolute one stop destination for spicy chicken lovers! The quality is at par with the other two outlets - hence, amazing! All in all, I loved it! Do try the new selection from the skewers as they have brought in some minor changes in their menu.

Jackson Mathews,"Rated BANGGGGGG!!! Connaught Place is bombarded by another one of these foreign casual dining restaurants, Nando's.... So I was out on a date, and we decided to have our lunch at Nando's, I really had high expectations from this restaurant and was craving to have their ""really really good chicken"" (that's how their advertisement goes about in the radio) and also because my brother told me that, back when he was in London, Nando's had one of the best grilled chicken. But that is London and this is India, that is all I have to say.. :P The staff gave us a table and told us that a waiter would soon be available to take our order and give us suggestions, for which we waited for sometime and finally we had to call the guy to do the same. Overall, the staff was pleasant and the food was delivered quickly on our table. We order for a (1) Meal platter, which had 4 huge pieces of mildly peri-peri spiced chicken, 2 regular sides of fries and coleslaw and 2 bottomless soft drinks, (2) a Chicken Breast Fillet Burger and (3) a Creamy Cheese Cake, the bill totaled to around 1.5K and made us completely full.. The food looked really scrumptious, which made me dig into it the moment it was kept on the table ( that's why i couldn't click the food and hence had to steal my girls' snapchat story, next time it'd be better, i promise!! haha). So i first started off with the burger. (2) Chicken Breast Fillet Burger: The burger tasted good, although now that i think of it, we should've ordered for the Hot peri-peri spiced burger patty instead of the medium spiced one, because it doesn't pack much of a punch in it. The burger bun was also good, but it could've been softer, although i liked it because it held together throughout. The special Nando's mayonnaise put in it was tasty and the veggies inside it were crunchy.. (1) Meal platter: For me those 4 pieces of chicken were quite huge ( i say this in comparison to the chicken provided by KFC, and i don't know why, but i warn you that, while eating, i compared Nando's chicken with KFC's fiery grilled chicken ). I made the same mistake here of not going for the Hot peri-peri, thinking that it would be too spicy. The chicken was a tad overcooked and therefore it wasn't as juicy as i expected it to be. Overall this was average and it didn't blow my mind away. The fries and coleslaw were good both in taste and quantity.. (3) Creamy Cheese Cake: It was good, the salty biscuit base went well with the sweet cream cheese.. Overall, the cake was nice, but the cream cheese could've been softer as it was a little hard to cut through the cake with the spoon.. A 3.5/5 for Nando's.. :'D ps. It came to my knowledge, after reading the other reviews, that they have a variety of sauces, but they gave me, just the medium peri-peri sauce along with my chicken!!! ohh so rude nando's!!!

Rest of them were decent.The interiors were really nice but the tables were a little too close to each other so we could hear what the people in the next table were talking.

The moment you enter the place , you realise it has a great ambience , the place is full of people , cool decor and lighting and an open kitchen . And the food is by far the most visually appealing I ever came across . And for the first time ever in my life I regretted being a vegetarian. The service was excellent , menu was interesting but vegetarians don't have a lot to choose from . Nice music and atmosphere but strictly average food . It was not bad but it didn't blow my mind. Overall it was an okay experience , I don't about others but vegetarians can skip it. Nice drinks though.",Rated 2.5,11,18,??
Natasha Kapoor,"Rated Strictly average. Don't know what the hoopla is about, really. Ordered the Chicken peri peri burger, and I'd, honestly rather have the Dunkin Donuts Tough Guy burger over this overpriced, flavourless chicken burger. Also ordered the Veg Esmer-somethin', which is just a fancy name for some really lousy paneer tikka. I don't see myself going back for anything. Not a big fan of the Peri peri sauce either ... but hey, that's just me. My advice would be to skip this and head on to KFC or Dunkin'.",Rated 2.5,15,100,??
Tushar Swarup,Rated I had high expectations from Nando's as I had heard really good reviews about the Vasant Kunj outlet. And it totally met my expectations. Chicken Peri-Peri was too good. I also ordered a Chicken Breast Pita and it was excellent too. The service was amazing and fast. I ordered Mint Refresh which was not to my taste so they replaced it without any hesitation. Its quite reasonable too. Overall experience was great!,Rated 4.5,19,199,??

Sajat Kumar Jain,"Rated Not the same Nando's. I am a fan of Nando's peri peri flame grilled chicken and when I heard about their new outlet in CP, my first thoughts were ""finally a Nando's close to my home"". The experience was however a little different than what I expected. Some key points: 1. Staff really need to be trained on how to best serve their customers. Not a problem with their behavior but we asked to get water at least 3 times and never got any (we stopped bothering after getting our lemonades). 2. Quality of chicken: guys please, you need to stay consistent on this. Our chicken was a little over cooked and lacked flavors. Sadly I will have to continue driving to the Vasant Kunj outlet to enjoy some good peri peri chicken. sajatjain.com",Rated 3.0,130,314,??
Bhagyashree Nair,"Rated I don't usually say this about the salads.. But, I have to in this case. Nando's serves their salads like dreams on plates.. I had the Mediterranean salad and couldn't stop gushing about it! It was absolutely divine and perfectly plated! The iceberg lettuce leaves, the olives, the tomatoes, the generous dose of olive oil they serve and peri peri salt.. It was fresh and delicious! I can also vouch for the chicken they serve.. Specially with the lemon and herb sauce they have.. Must try for everyone! And it's considerably affordable too..!",Rated 4.5,14,154,??

The Fat Bong,Rated had the most insulting and humiliating experience of my life in a restaurant and it doesnt even deserve the 1.0 rating that i had to give it to write this review. we had just about ordered the starters and a portuguese lemonade along with it. as this was our first time at nando's we had no idea what the drink looked like. I was promptly served with a drink which looked and tasted suspiciously like regular coke. actually it took me a bit to realize that it was regular coke only. my wife who was facing the waiters saw them laughing and sniggering amongst themselves. they knew it was coke they had served and it was not a mistake at all but a deliberate attempt to fool us. even when the issue was raised with the manager the waiter didnt have the courtesy to come and apologize. we walked out in a huff and swore never to return. we dont want to pay money for practical jokes being played on us.,Rated 1.0,22,287,??
Isha Saxena,"Rated Long after landing in my wishlist and after much excitement for the CP outlet, I finally got to visit this place. The place was packed as expected and there was a 20 minute waiting. Usually we give up if we have to wait this long but determined on dining in Nando's this time, we decided to instead enjoy the light winter sun while we stood outside the place. The names were called and we were lead upstairs to our table. The place is spread over two floors with gorgeous light fixtures and wooden installations, open kitchen, an array of seating options and the most alluring flavours of grilling chicken. The plush comfortable couches and big enough tables stand smartly with 'tell us your flavour' placard and an egg shaped salt dispensor. Without much ado, we ordered half of the mild peri peri grilled chicken and a mild espetada with a side of fries and coleslaw. The service is stupendous considering the full house. (Y) With heavy ceramic plates and topnotch FnS cutlery, two enormous pieces of chicken, well seasoned and grilled to perfection. The chicken was oozing juices and even though I was quite sceptical about the spice levels, the chicken was very well done and we quite enjoyed it teaming it with the variety of peri peri sauces- the garlic one being my favourite with a palatable tangy garlic flavour. The espetada arrived grandly on a skewer with coleslaw and fries. Juicy, boneless peri peri chicken pieces grilled with bell pepper. The boneless pieces were much more tender than the classic one and very delectable. With the perfect consistency coleslaw and piping hot juicy, crispy fries, the sides perfectly complemented the chicken. A must, must visit! :D chompslurrpburp.wordpress.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Kashish Mittal,"Rated A very Nice experience, starting with the food was made to perfection, the Veg offerings were also made quite nice. The service was superb, though the waiting staff needs a little more confidence to answer the queries. The cleanliness of restaurant was amazing including the Washrooms.The ambiance was very soothing, there was bit of a waiting at loo most of the times, No doubt Peri Peri Chicken is amazing, some specials are worth to try too, ask the person they will advise you the specials there, very mouth watering. The portion of chips, was really decent and the total meal value was worth. The pricing is superb in comparison, not to heavy on pocket as compared the food and services.On my second visit, there was a sea improvement, and they made my eyes roll out water with their extra hot preparation of dishes, i m craving for a lot of water,, my tongue is grasping for cold air ...Hats off...CP, Nando's you a have done amazing work......",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Mohini,"Rated a very good place. must try for all hardcore nonveg(chicken) lovers. i tried the grilled chicken in peri perri sauce. the portions could be bigger, given that they come with bones. the kiddie box is simply superb. a very balanced meal that includes grilled veggies n fries ( good quantity) n a glass of orange juice ( Real's). more importantly the fries are very well done n salt free. the grilled boneless chicken in the kiddie box ( about 5-6 pieces) is done to perfection. the only problem here is the staff. although they are polite and helpful, they seem scatterbrained ( probably because the place is new). but they took a long time to get my takeaway order right and still forgot to pack fries!! moreover, the first time i went there , they gave me grilled chicken without any sauce and half a glass of juice!!! and the second time i ordered the same thing they gave me some kind of honey sauce and a LARGE glass of juice!! lets c 3rd time what they give me (lol hahah) . looks lik all orders are a game of luck! I would recommend the food but take care to explain slowly and patiently what you need, unless you like surprises. But maybe they should be given the benefit of the doubt and will settle their quality issues with time.",Rated 3.5,72,45,??

Ashima Saxena,"Rated For hardcore non vegetarians, like me and my friends, nandos is an absolute delight. For my birthday 10 of us went and kept it real simple- whole chickens and bottomless cokes. By the time we finished, we had a mini mountain of chicken bones and tighter belts because our bellies were so full. The server was very efficient, refilling our glasses and getting more chicken to the table. Good food, unlimited coke, great ambiance - the perfect treat. Love the hot peri peri sauce. It's addicting. Makes you want to keep coming back for more. Potato wedges and corn are my favorite side dishes. This place will see a lot of revisits. Specially because with their loyalty card you get free chicken on subsequent visits. What an idea!",Rated 4.0,48,215,??
Mayank,"Rated Good as expected!!! Truly spicy and as matter of standardization equally good!!!!

Ujjwal Mehra,Rated Another great restaurant in cp. Place is famous for its peri peri sauce ! Jusy like the one in vasant kunj this one has also got nice ambience. The have 2 floors : ground and first. The place is a heaven for meat cravers! Mouth watering delicious succulent peri peri chicken. Also the pita bread with peri peri hummus is quiet good. Staff is also friendly and well aware of their menu. The service is really quick. Overall its a really good place for spicy food lovers & meat cravers !,Rated 4.0,16,90,??
Varun Mahajan,Rated Well desi food lovers like me will always like to pronounce it as indian way nandoos rather than nando's!!!! Peri-peri isn't something I love n this place wasn't something that could change my view. The food is just average for veggies like me. The service is prompt and ambience a perfect example of skew morph ism. Just a new place in the block.,Rated 3.0,111,84,??
Jyoti Kumari,"Rated The walls tell you the story behind the unique food that Nando's serves (quite literally). It is one when west -meets-Africa-story. The decor has nothing worth mentioning, esp if get a table on first floor. Ground floor has a feel good, trendier look. I am almost intimidated by the great reviews posted here for this outlet. Anyway, the place has some great table sauces, but the dishes are dry, I.e. chickens are not juicy inside, burgers are big and drab. Food is inconvenient to eat because of the way they serve it. Visit it if you want to, but even if you don't, it's totally OK.",Rated 2.5,3,0,??
Gaurav,"Rated It simply doesn't stand up to the hype and the branding it carries! The place has great ambience but the food fails to tingle your taste buds. The presentation and quantity of the food you get is excuisite, but the taste fails to add a punch. Service is lovely and if your looking for a nice place to hang out with compromising a little for what you get go for it. But if your a serious foodjunkie and want flavours to dance all around your senses, then give it a thaught",Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Rishab Chandra,Rated I ended up visiting the newest Nando's (C.P.) for a quick lunch before a business meeting and it was nice to not wait in line for a Moroccan Butternut and Grilled Peppers with Chicken Fillet for a change. Although I did find the burger a bit dry but the delicious sauce and fresh Cole Slaw made up for it as always. The best part of the visit was actually not the meal but how quickly it came. I was done in about 20 min's from seating to paying my bill. Definitely recommended for a quick bite before a meeting without burning a hole in ones pocket !,Rated 4.5,8,6,??

Gurjot Singh,"Rated The recently opened outlet- Nandos CP, is like a boon to me and to almost all the delhite who is crazy for it! I had an inevitable craving for having the juiciest chickens and nandos is the solution to meet the desires of my palate! So, the chicken (we took the full platter- with 1 whole chicken and 4 sides) was tender, thoroughly marinated and succulent to its every bone! Potato wedges, spicy rice and three bean salad is always my pick from sides! However, I would never recommend to order burgers here! I had before at vk outlet ( which was disappointing )and a friend insisted to try here ! The bun was dry, and I expected that( to be very true) and the overall taste gets latent because of the extra dry bun! Espatada carnival was a twist to the regular espatada! And was tasting delicious! However the chicken was a bit hard to chew! Overall, a satisfactory experience! Nice ambiance! Decent flight of stairs, giving this outlet a huge seating area spread over two levels! Great service too- service with all smiles!",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Esha Shekhar,"Rated A new eating place close to office is always appreciated and this one didnt disappoint. I went with my colleagues for a weekday lunch, and it was a happy and satisfying experience till the end of the meal. The staff were really courteous and patient, and were eager to help you with your orders. I guess they have recently opened so they were being extra nice, but doesnt matter, and it is highly appreciated. Coming to the food, Nandos is a must go place for all chicken lovers. We ordered the Jumbo Meal for 4 people, which came with 2 whole chicken as well as 5 side servings. The portions were big and value for money. What I liked about the chicken was it was well smattered with peri peri sauce, and was very well baked. The best part was that it wasnt dry from the inside but nice and succulent. The side services of bean salad was something I specially liked. Potato wedges were standard, and same goes with the rice. We ordered Iced Tea to go along with it, which was pretty decent. All in all, I liked the feel of the place. I came out happy, full and satisfied eating the food. Nandos have a good strategy to enlist customer loyalty with their loyalty card.

Aarushi Srivastava,Rated It's always been my favourite for chicken. But having it in CP is just icing on the cake. Ordered the PeriPeri Quarter and the very fresh Portuguese Chicken Salad. Both were really fresh and and truly make you want to come back for the authentic Nando's chicken. Also the person who served us told us to try the Portuguese Lemonade. That's surely amazing and would love to have it during summers. Great new outlet and nicely done interiors. Awesome staff quality also.,Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Subhramitra Borkakati,"Rated Visited the Nando's outlet in CP and after around 30 mins of awaiting finally we got a place. The staff was friendly. Ambience is good, not that great.Music was good. We ordered chicken wings and a meal with whole chicken and potato wedges sides. The chicken was really good. The potato wedges were below expectations. And yeah, we also ordered the portuguese lemonade, never ever order that. It tasted like fanta mixed with a lot of water and chilli flakes in it (may be that's how the portuguese lemonade is supposed to taste, who knows!) Strongly not recommended. I would suggest go for the bottomless fanta, sprite etc. instead or try something else. The bill was around 2300/- for 3 people. And just when I take out my card to pay, they remember to inform us that the Card machines are not working. They sent a guy with me to find a WORKING ATM ('coz its CP) and after trying 3 different ATMS I finally paid the amount. So please confirm before hand if are like me an do not carry much cash around. This little thing at the end really spoiled the mood and experience and hence the 3.0 rating. Note to Nando's staff, please let the customers know before they enter that the Card machines are not working and not when they have already finished their food. Mostly because you are located in CP and you have better chances of finding a man dressed as a chicken then finding a working ATM.",Rated 3.0,2,50,??

Ic30,"Rated Good interiors, friendly staff, decent peri peri hummus with pita, the most amazing and juicy and succulent chicken I have had in days! I ordered for the extra hot 1/4 chicken. Being someone who enjoys insanely hot food this turned out to be pretty mild for someone who likes medium spicy. Having said that, the chicken is SO good that I think it can make up for any possible flaw. Any day a way better option than chicken leaking with oil. It swings between being easy as well as expensive but all worth every penny just for that perfectly grilled and succulent chicken",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
