Shaifali Aggarwal,"Rated we visited lord of the drinks to celebrate valentines. Nice, subtle place to visit. Please carry a valid age proof as they insist on a 25 years legal drinking age. The dim lights, sofa seating ,nice music, the terrace viewmakes it a place worth visiting. We ordered couple of starters including dahi kekebab , cheese peri peri pizza and lasagneveg and non veg.Everything was worth tasting. In drinks we ordered LIIT pitcher and every drop of it was worth a drink. I will highly recommend this place.",Rated 4.0,11,34,??
Siddharth Mehta,Rated Excellent place and no prizes for guessing its straight out of The Lord of the Rings scene. Beautiful open terrace with balconies overlooking the bustling CP wherein you can enjoy Sheeshas and the best of drinks.,Rated 4.5,33,25,??
  ,"Rated Its an awesome place to be on weekends. Enjoyed the medieval ambience, service and drinks well. Just lacked the wooden beer mugs to nail it. Table reservation is a must if you are going there, else you have to wait atleast 15 mins to get one. But even though it will be worth it. And the terrace view is another treat, should definitely try before the winter is over..",Rated 5.0,2,6,??

Siddharth Kathuria,"Rated Nice, subtle place to visit. Food was good but they don't offer attractive schemes on drinks which doesn't justify the outlets name. Please carry a valid age proof as they insist on a 25 years legal drinking age. They are mentioning the PAN No. as their Service Tax No. on their bills and collecting service tax which should be corrected ASAP. Must visit place for couples.",Rated 3.0,19,107,??
Dolker Bhotia,"Rated Ambience is good with many different seating options and the rooftop seating is one of the best in CP. Also LOD's menu has a variety of cuisines to chose from. We had the peri peri veg pizza, cheese fries and fried chicken.The peri peri pizza was the best. The cheese French fries could be better. All in all the considering the ambience , the food and the price Lord of the drinks is a must visit in CP.",Rated 3.5,2,2,??
Nitish Kharbanda,"Rated Now I would like you mention why only 3. To be honest it was my first visit to lotd. Excuse me for the short form. And the first impression was good the ambiance and how they have kept the entire place is mesmerizing. But what spoiled my mood was the manager who was allotin the table. We had reserved a table in advance knowing its a sufi night and it's always a hassle during the performance as everyone wants to get the best table and we wanted the same too. So coming back to the problem, the manager had no idea about the reservation and when I told him its unfair to say no to us seeing 60% of the tables were empty which he claimed were reserved and though I too had a reservation I was asked not to sit in any of those tables. And finally I pursued him. And got a table. What came next was the speed of the staff. The food was served well ahead of the liquor which should be the other way around. The quantity of the pitchers order was lesser than what the drink menu claims. You can check it in the picture yourself. Over no complaints about the quality of food but lotd fails miserably in their hospitality. The only good part about the night was the guy performing @ rahul, his performance kept us stay there till closure.",Rated 3.0,2,34,??
Priyanka Garg,"Rated We visited there for a birthday party. The dim lights, sofa seating and nice music makes it a place worth visiting. We ordered couple of starters and main course. Everything was worth tasting especialy the biryani. I will highly recommend this place",Rated 4.0,42,15,??
Akanksha Bajpai Sehgal,"Rated The place is hugeee and very well managed, the terrace floor is just awesomee... Read the review on zomato before deciding to go there, we went on a tuesday night and had to wait for 15 mins to get a seat on the terrace... The terrace was thatttt busy for a tuesday night... The food was scrumptious. We ordered prawns which were very flavourfull and fresh, chicken straganoff, fish fingers, chicken biryani were all delicious... The best part was the dj.. The music was soooo amazing that people were flocking around the dj and enjoying to the coreee...

Beers dispensers was just what we needed for catching up with ol buddies Chilly panner didn't taste too good Chicken tikka and chicken pizza ware good Service was quick and upto the mark Peanut masala was saved the day for us vegetarians But the bill was exorbitant. To think 4 people 3 dispensers a couple of beer mugs. 3 non veg food items 3 peanut masalas and one chilly paneer to shoot out bill to a bloody Rs.9,000/- Ain't worth it...",Rated 2.0,62,266,??
Nishant Rana,"Rated We went there yesterday it was my friends birthday, we reserved a table for 5 but when we reached there after 15 minutes their staff members who were present inside already gave our table to somebody else..... After waiting for 20 minutes we got a table. After that we were shocked when we ordered 3 Jack Daniel's small but in actual they served us 100 pipers and worst part was that the guy inside was not admitting his fault after arguments there the bartender admits his fault.......so my advice to all is to beware what you are ordering be ensure you're getting for what you're paying",Rated 1.0,33,105,??
Deepak Bhasin,Rated As the name goes ... This place is no doubt the lord ... Of Drinks & Lord of parties. The terrace is an Osm place to be at any time of the year. The food quality is really excellent. The pricing is bit higher but is worth every penny.,Rated 4.5,15,58,??

Jai AroRa,Rated Please make your L.I.I.T strong ones..they suck big time..Usually they are strong .i requested Mr jitender to make certain additions in the same but his best was not worth it. It was still the same. If u are spending Rs 400 on such an item you deserve a full value but in realty it was not worthy of its half the value. Please change it .,Rated 2.5,1,2,??
Dheeraj Aggarwal,"Rated Huge rooftop. You can stand at the bar as well. There was a live DJ on a Wednesday evening; that was quite bad; hope that there are better ones on the weekends.

Welcome & Ambience was good & spacious but I wasnt there to play. Food was below average not worth the money I have paid for. Service was ok. Dont understand what people have been praising it for.

Nefarious Minx,"Rated Perfect to the T. The ambience and the foood makes no complain but I guess they need trained stuff. Its annoying when to every question the ans comes as ""I dont know. Have to check"" or for every thing you need you repeat 10 times in a row to get the order placed. Thats annoying. LIKE REALLY ANNOYING.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

DC,"Rated LORD OF THE DRINKS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE TOP 03 IN CP !!!I moved to Delhi from Mumbai for this place only I guess. LOVED IT. Great place to chill and either get wasted or have a lovely night out with friends. HUGE Floor Space, probably the largest in CP area. Great atmosphere for a cold, snowy winter night - warm and dark tones with equally cool music playlist. The menu is well-considered and everything I had was very well seasoned, perfectly cooked, and a notch above most gastropubs.",Rated 4.0,40,332,??

Service was excellent nd quick... They can work a little with food but still no complaints. It was my second visit nd will be looking forward for many more.

Chef AB,"Rated It's a hugeeee place. This review is looking pending. Coz I went to this place quite a while back. So the ambience is superb, filament bulbs, statue's, leather sofa... Drinks are also great, but I have heard and experience my self that the items which are cheap or less in price are rarely available. Food was decent taste wise, presentation wise it was better then how it tasted. All In All will go again for the name of the place.",Rated 3.5,34,2018,??
Shantanu Sharma,Rated One of the most happening places in cp. Must visit place. Best ambience . If one loves drinking at a good place then lord of the drinks is the best option available. Good hanging out place for college students.,Rated 4.5,18,3,??
Neelakshi Singh Tomar,"Rated We visited on a Monday evening and to our surprise the crowd was way too much which took our order an hour to be served. As the name says the place is supposed to serve the ""Lords""of the drink which perhaps did not happen. We ordered a Lords martini classic margarita and a warriors drink(rum based). I cannot say the drink stood out. Margarita's quantity was way too less the martini has some cheap vodka which was way too bitter. If they charge so much for a drink I feel the quality should be worthy of that. On the contrary food was pretty nice ceaser salad stirred vegetables and chicken quesadilla were perfectly fine.",Rated 4.0,29,48,??
Goyam Jain,"Rated Stellar ambiance. Great location and infra. Same goes for view. Disappointingly everything else is horrible to average at max. Service is pathetic. Dozens of things in bar menu are not available. Food was okish. After trying 4 to 5 things, had to order commodity item like french fries, but sadly....",Rated 2.0,1,73,??
XBurrper,Rated Ideal place on a cool breezy Delhi night. Surprising it to be packed even on a week night. We opted for the terrace level and took the table facing the roadside. The live music and the singer was superb and couldn't have better created an ambiance. The beer are very well priced. 90 bucks a pint. We ordered a paneer appetizer and a dimsum. Not too much variety in starters and the waiters could be more courteous. But I still give this place highest recommendations for a visit especially during winters.,Rated 4.5,34,14,??
Pastachio,"Rated Went with frnds on a weekend.. At abt 12 pm.. It was not at all good.. Mediocre service .. Mediocre food and Mediocre staff.. n very expensive acc to all these aspects..

Bharat Mehta,"Rated Very few places in CP can afford to offer such a fantastic view! Along with the view, a very contemporary place with amazing food and great drinks! We ordered nachos, dahi ke kebab and peri peri chicken. All three of them along with lots of kingfisher ultra, great music and that epic view; a deadly combination! A must try! Cheers :)",Rated 5.0,51,125,??
Shatabdi Biswas,"Rated I would say it is one of best places in Delhi.. even though the food is a little disappointing, the ambience is a perfect. Live performance by unplugged saints made our Friday night. Heavy wood work on the ground floor and well thought interiors made the place look like a cowboy hub. But as you reach the top floor the air changes, it becomes classy. The rates are not heavy on pockets either. Recommended.",Rated 4.0,7,187,??
Sahil Arora,"Rated First when i read the name 'lord of the drinks' i hoped it would be themed after 'lord of the rings' but its not. It is jst another cafe in cp with dim lights and loud music. The food is a little above average and the drinks are priced well but they do lack in their beer collection. I would have given it a rating of 3.5 but it got 4.0 from me because of its rooftop which is the only reason i would visit it again. The ambiance at the rooftop is really better than the lower level. It is a huge area where they host acoustic sessions on Wednesday nights which are pretty good to be at with a drink in your hand. Recommended: tomato cream pasta and bhatti murg tikka. For drinks, they do make a good red wine sangria.",Rated 4.0,7,1,??
Piyush Nahata,"Rated I am not much of cafe person but this seems to be a little different! The decor is a beauty! Ambiance is amazing and the place is filled with interesting stuff including an 8 feet armory which you would want a picture with! Not a hole in your pocket and this place has some amazing cocktails and food, Try out the Fried Rice, it has a unique flavor if you dont, not a problem but do try out the SUSHI! This one really stole the show, it is amazing and and one of the best i've had in a while! Just goes to shay equal efforts put everywhere! Definitely visiting this place again!",Rated 4.0,42,516,??
Mudita Pandey,Rated Staff has too much of attitude. Specially Vijay! Food is good. Horrible artist performing on Sunday. Need to get better people to perform. Had a lot of expectations because of ambiance and this place being another Priyank siukhija venture. Visit for ambience! Else a big no!,Rated 1.0,2,151,??
Aastha Nanda,"Rated Had heard a lot about this place... huge space they have... both inside and terrace sitting... i loved their terrace sitting .... it gives you a full view of the CP area but the sad part was their management.... twice they kept the dishes ordered by someone else on our table... and they were just confused and left it there... came after 5 minutes and took it away... idiots... we called the server and ordered for NV nachos and just requested him to give it only with chicken but the server told us ""mam nahi ho payega vaise hi bohot basadh ho rai he"" just imagine.... like it's some kind of dhaba or something.... although the food tasted fine... but service was a bit issue...",Rated 3.0,36,26,??
Anant Kulshreshtha,Rated Wow this place has got something... amazing ambience... orangish light adds to the ambience.. Their sandwiches are amazing along with the dips.... They have some good music numbers.. Overall I will rate 4 out 5.. Cheers!!!,Rated 4.0,4,1,??
Ankit Jain [~pO~],Rated Okay the ambiance here is a 10 on 10 If this place has naked chicks for service this place would look like it is owned by Tyrian Lanister.. Swords and knight suits all over.. Yes they have spent a lot.. The service is good and the staff is well behaved and trained.. The food is yet to come.. But m sure they won't screw it up.. If u and ur partner is a fan of GOT ( Game of Thrones) this place is a must.. For sure a date place if ur date is about fun and not Romance.,Rated 4.5,107,140,??
Manisha Murjani,Rated Ambience-The outdoor section is really pleasant. Service-The management is obnoxious as they were asking seated patrons to vacate for customers who were tipping the waiters and host!! Food-The regular bar finger food nothing special.,Rated 1.0,5,15,??
Vaishali Batra,"Rated Went there on a Thursday night, when a Sufi singer was performing. The place was filled on a Thursday night and this beautiful place was lighted up with halogens in the middle of cp. The interiors are different and the terrace is worth sitting at. The service is good too. To begin with we ordered a hookah and a tropical pitcher of liit. We ordered some beers, another pitcher of power stroke which was very nice,its an liit. French cosmopolitan was also very nice. It's a good place for sangria also. A couple more jd's and Jim beams we ordered along. For the starters we ordered dahi ke kebab,it wasnt that very great,but were not bad either. The chicken wings were very nice. We loved the fish and chips, loved the ceaser salad. Then we ordered chicken involtini which was very nice ,veg bruschetta ,nachos and salsa. In the end we ordered a white sauce mushroom pasta which was excellent. Like the place,will visit again",Rated 3.5,108,1184,??
Abhijai Singh,"Rated I went yesterday for my friends birthday. This place is absolutely fantastic. The staff is very accommodating and helpful. The food, booze and hookah all was served on time and our server kept checking on us every 15 minutes or so despite the place being jam packed. Must visit for everyone.

Sahil Jindal,"Rated Heard so much about this place. None of those were true when we visited. We were 4 friends went in the evening of a Sunday to find that service was awful. None of the waiters came to take our order. They did not even care if I called them. After I somehow managed to order, food took a lot of time to come and it was below average in taste. After getting annoyed we decided to leave and called for the bill. The waiter took 15 minutes to bring it. Very bad experience, will NOT visit again.",Rated 1.0,1,49,??

Raghav S,Rated So my friend took me here on a Saturday night. Being situated in the heart of Delhi this place was crowded as expected.

The prices of drinks are fine. Overall a decent place to hangout on a pretty good location.,Rated 3.0,37,28,??
Neeti Bhat,"Rated Visit this place only if you want a perfect ambience, other than that there is nothing you would admire here. These guys don't serve you water until you ask for it & they don't even have the basic spice set on the table. Ours kept on distributed to every other table. The food was horrible.... We ordered chicken nachos & the chicken was so hard to chew, being a nachos lover i hated this. Second up we ordered peri peri chicken which didn't even taste like one. It was normal chicken with the typical mild Indian flavors. Absolutely disappointing!! The only thing on our table which was good was the BBQ mushroom pizza. We ordered a Martini pitcher which was absolutely horrible. The pitcher didn't even fill 4 glasses they served us is. The taste was not great either. The only reason to rate this place 3 is because of the ambience other than that it was a total disaster!!",Rated 3.0,73,203,??

Apoorv Agarwal,"Rated Much hyped place in the heart of the city, Connaught Place, my experience here was not a good one.. Went here on 1st January to celebrate New Year.. Starting with ambience it fulfills everything you want from such a place.. When it comes to service, food and drinks, this place lacked everything... For food we has ordered something else but we got something else and the things we got were not worth it.. For drinks we had ordered half JD and it looked less than that so we asked our server to bring a measuring cup to which we found out we were short of one complete peg of 30ml!! Also the place lacks draught beer options, and the ones they have are not worth it at all.. This kind of service is not expected out of such a place.. Then coming down the floor, we were in a mood to dance and asked the DJ to hit some dance numbers to which he replied rudely saying this is not a dancing place and no requests accepted..

Priya Saxena,"Rated Quite intrigued by the name, I visited the place with great hopes. To my surprise, it was just another cafe in CP. The dim, orangish-black lights, a little too loud music, limited beer options and not so yum nachos, the visit was surely not an impressive one.

Manisha Virmani,Rated food was ok but hospitality was poor. The manager himself didn't knew how many tables are vacant and how many were occupied. We had to search the table on our own. I planned to arrange a get together party at this place but after the experience I cancelled to do it at this place.You really need to be more humble in your approach because your lounge is not enjoying monopoly in cp there are N number of lounges to visit.,Rated 1.0,3,17,??
Siddharth Gaba,Rated What an experience it was to be at this place. Amazing service staff who were so hospitable with their approach. I was with my friends on a chilly winter night sitting at their terrace but the heaters were able to provide enough warmth. Appetisers they served were delicious whether it be their chicken or nachos. Live band made the place more happening. Sheesha again was the best I have experienced in CP. keep it up guys!!!!,Rated 4.5,8,68,??

Disha Bansal,Rated Such a below average place! We opted for outdoor seating coz it was evening when I visited.. The food was way way below average as compared to what other places offer for same or lesser price! I ordered roasted tomato soup which actually tasted like hot Virgin Mary.. With lots of pepper and a bad sour taste.. My husband ordered clear soup with dumplings... But seriously that soup was out of some 'chinjabi' food truck.. Tasted burnt.. For starters we ordered paneer gilafi kebab... They were soft but had too much of cornflour or God knows what powdered stuff in them... Scrambled eggs were soft and fluffy but with no flavour or taste... That was served with nachos and a cold slice of roasted garlic bread... Unusual combination... The worst was the cutlery which was laid out... food was served in plates and pans which had the colour coating coming off from places... Yikes! The two stars are only for the service.. Which was prompt and coz they have an open sitting... Would never visit or recommend..,Rated 2.0,3,0,??

Fitfoodie,"Rated a good bar, but nothing to boast about. Dim lighting, average music and food are its main characteristics. There are a few warrior statues placed in the corners and that is it about the lord of the rings theme. Snacks are not that great when you speak about the quantity and the taste.

The first floor is indoor and is very soothing, with dim lighting. On the top floor its an open bar, seating area which has pink cushions which looks cool I would say and there is another area overlooking the main road, where we actually sat. The music was good, the seating is comfortable and is not one bit cramped. The service is top notch. We ordered a paneer pizza, thw topping was good but I like my pizza to have lots of cheese on it, which was sadly missing. An OK dish. The drums of heaven were too good. The sauce was the right amount of spicy, the chicken used was fresh and tender. A 5/5 dish.

When me and my friends visited this pub the ambience reminds you of game of thrones episodes , 300 movie, all warrior equipments around loved it but couldn't spend munch time there as they didn't even had the basic rum like old monk or basic beer kingfisher which busted me and my friends anger so had to leave the place early before doing cheers. I hope next time LOD should have the baisc drinks at least as before we go for something expensive , I feel before we start , we need to check out the normal drinks but LOD just wanted to sell the expensive drinks to empty our pockets .

When I entered the ppace I realise it was not just any CP caf but something was different about it. We found the private seating and comfortably ordered our food. For the starters we ordered manchow soup with dried noodles which tasted very unique. Moving on we ordered a couple of more beverages followed by there hakka noodles which had a nice quantity and quality and in the second visit we ordered a lot starting with peach ice tea, chilly paneer, noodles to count a few.

It has a wonderful roof top overlooking inner circle and can be a delight to be on a winter afternoon. Having said that, the management should consider putting some shades at least as direct sun can be bit too much at times. I found the food to be average we ordered chicken crostini, mushroom crostini and lamb kebab; nothing outstanding here. They didn't have any indian beer ??

Harish Iyengaar,"Rated Great place! Great ambience! Great on your wallet! Bookmarked for quite some time, finally got around paying LOTD a visit and it was worth it. Made the mistake of going there on a Saturday night with no place to sit whatsoever but the staff people were considerate enough to accommodate us on a place for two somehow and managed to snag a seat last minute at 10pm on a Saturday night - yay! Music sucked a little initially and they went completely 2000s out of the blue(and not even the songs that make you nostalgic) but it picked up towards the end of the night. The drinks - hard liquor based were quite potent but the sangria apparently wasn't. You couldn't feel the wine in the sangria. Head for the classic old fashion for a nice kicker in whiskeys. The jger bombs too were insane! Food wise it's average - they burnt a good part of my peri peri chicken pizza - I'd avoid that. Ambience wise the place is beautiful! The entire set up was amazing and the lighting was just right to bring you to the mood. Service is excellent - polite waiters and ready to offer good suggestions which is rare to find.

The place is based on Lord of the rings /gladiator /you guessed the theme with armours/warrior helmets/Shields placed throughout the restaurant.

The interiors are well done and give it a very different look from all the other lounges in delhi..but thats about it... The Drinks and the food are like 1/5.. And if u are actually enjoying something the staff will surely kill it for you... I ordered an adams liit..which turned out to be horrible... I told the waiter that something was not right with the drink...and the reply i got was..""Alchohol aur dalwa deta hu sir"" ...and he did that and it tasted even more pathetic ... Asked him what would tossed peri peri chicken would be like..and the answer was ""latpata type ka chicken hoga..""

Sunakshi Aggarwal,Rated I was quite surprised with the place. Cp has a lot of bars to go to and it's definitely tough to choose. I wouldn't have been here had it not been for a friends meeting. On a Saturday the place was completely sold out. I guess it's going to do better in winters as their terrace is beautiful. It was well heated and had good service an was inexpensive too. The interiors are also well done and are apt for the name. The only reason I am rating it low is the food.

Ankit Gupta,"Rated Went there in a group of 11 - had a gala time!! We decided to sit on the roof and with the mild Delhi winter and the burners present, it was a perfect setting. We ordered a lot of drinks - the pricing is really competitive compared to other bars in CP - but that means your drinks have been watered down - like Long Island iced tea was Long Island iced iced tea. But when you are going in a big group and everyone is singing songs and reliving old school days - you don't care too much about the watered drinks but try to soak in the atmosphere. Coming onto food - mostly we had finger food - chips, tikkas etc etc and everything was okay - so no qualms over there. The roof ambience was pretty impressive but they need to work out something so that people can read the menu without opening the flash lights of their mobile phones!!

The goods- Nice location of the place located in central Delhi. Huge place to accommodate a lot of people. The terrace dining place is good except some parts, made a good Canadian friend there too. The servers were really good- specifically Ajay, Deepak and Nitish served us. The bads- As soon as we entered, one of the ladies at the counters from the management was very rude. Even though they had plenty of places, she was very arrogant to give a place for 4 people. Ordered loads of items. The food portions are bad. They serve very less portions and the pizza was disappointing- the BBQ sauce was not really good one, the base was burnt and we just gulped it. The management seemed a bit irresponsible too. I lost a broche, asked them five times but nobody did even respond properly! Too high prices of certain drinks... So, its not much worth the money but yes, definitely a try once.

Apurva Dwivedi,"Rated This was the final spot of our self organised pub crawl in Delhi. We had already been to 5 places before this and this was our 6th one. Finding this place was a task in itself but once found, this place was worth all the trouble we had in finding it. This place is huge and serves sheesha as well. We ordered for pizzas, pastas, momos and a host of drinks. The food was really nice and we did not have any complaints. We also ordered for quite a lot of drinks and had their liits. The drinks could have been a bit stronger but none the less we had a great time. The bill was around 3k per person which is okay given the kind of place ambiance and service they provide.",Rated 4.5,78,146,??
Ojay Gulati ,"Rated So after a lot of great reviews and recommendations, we ended up at Lord of the Drinks on Sunday night. Great ambience, amazing live music and the works, we expected a decent Sunday evening. But I guess that was too much to ask for. We ordered about 5 starters and a variety of drinks at about 9:15. And till 10.30 we were still waiting for most of our food. We understand it's a busy night and things take time but how much?? The tipping of point was when we were told that onion rings are not available as a side to the burger and we agreed to the fries, however, we were served a separate order of cheese fries which we sent back as it wasn't what we ordered. After waiting for over an hour to the rest of the starters to arrive, we asked the manager what seems to be the issue. In the meantime, we had a server tell us, in an EXTRMELY RUDE tone that it's our fault that we sent back the fries hence the rest of the order got delayed. ?!?! I do not get the logic.. Excuse Me do you wanna say the dim-sums got late because we sent the fries back which was your mistake??? After a fair share of argument with the waiters and so called Manager there, I had to approach the GM who was standing there but the Manager said I am the most senior person here.. Finally after spooling our night at this unruly place and waiting for about 1.5 hours we get our food we get our food within ""4minutes then"" Really dissapointed as this is a place I was really looking forward to. The only good thing was the guy singing there.. I think his name was Puneet and of course with MANOJ BAJPAI joining him was even better. But Sorry not going there again with such a horrible staff.

Tarun Arora,"Rated No doubt the place is talk of town place at the moment. Big couches seating, King's era ambience, sitting divided into different sections and a roof top, which on a night is mesmerising. The music is mostly EDM and is not loud so conversation over the table is easy. The food just came in like they knew what we would order, for the first time we had food served before the drinks, charismatic. The liquor options (beer in specific) as mentioned in menu are in menu only which is a very big low down. We were offered the sitting in some corner section with a reason that most of the sections were pre booked but could not find any occupied even after an hour. The hookah was good and guy replaced the coal whenever requested, however flavour dint lasted long and had cough issue once. Repeated the order for LIID and mentioned specifically not to add more ice to the existing tumbler, but Alas! the business tactics and ended up with a soar throat the following day. At first, the place is a invite but big places needs extra attention because the large attendance is difficult to handle.",Rated 3.0,9,1,??
Mayank Garg,"Rated I like most of the places of Priyank Sukhija but there is seriously something wrong with this place. When we arrived on the entrance of LOD the guy standing there told us that there is no waiting and you can go upstairs. Then on the 1st floor the guy told us that its all reserved and plz go to the terrace. When we went to terrace the same thing happened. Most of the tables were empty both on the 1st floor and the terrace. When we asked they said they all are reserved. Then why the hell the guy told us that there is no waiting. And how can space for more than 50 invisible people be reserved and you are not allowing customers to sit who are already standing in front of u. After bit of discussion on the same with the floor supervisor, we managed to get a table on the 1st floor. We first ordered the veg platter, white rum, red label and pinacolada. Now what happened here was surprising. We got the veg platter after 10-15 mins of our order (that was fast) but they kept us waiting for around half n hour for the drinks. And no water is served until u ask for it. This rating is for the ambiance, pizza which we ordered later, amazing music and the economical prices of the drinks. But i think management seriously needs to sort out things here. I am looking forward to visiting this place again in future and getting a better experience.",Rated 2.5,80,570,??

Vivek Saini,"Rated A place with a lot of hype around it. Has undoubtedly made into the must-go list of a lot of people. And it's almost next to impossible to get a table on a weekend. As is, quite evident from the name, the interiors on the first floor have been done totally in the medieval era of castles swords and Knights. It's brilliant and hard to miss. So is the entrance. The terrace however is no different from the other cafes/lounge by the same team. It's warm, comfortable though. The food is good enough, of not extraordinary. The portion size of most of the things is gigantic. Nachos are a great snack to go with! The drinks are however , just about average - more particularly the cocktails. Despite having a few lounge specials, the cocktails failed to strike a unique cord. Also, being so thematic, I could expect theme specific utensils, uniform of the staff. A lot could be done still, justifying the theme. Lastly, the staff. They serve quickly. But in a business like manner. Like a daily routine. At times they impart vibes of indifference. A little training in hospitality and courtesy, would be highly appreciated!",Rated 3.5,79,119,??
Hanish Bhatia,"Rated Rating of 2.5 is for the ambience of this place. However, my experience wasn't good enough. Food was good. No complaints. Otherwise, don't go by the menu prices. It's clever how they play around by keeping the prices low but reduce the quantity of what you order. I don't know the bar rules but when i order 1L pitcher of LIIT i expect 1L LIIT and not 300ml drink and 700ml ice cubes. I know every restro-bar in delhi is doing it but there is a limit to everything. When we complained the waiters had their own justifications. Later, manager came in and offered us to replace the jar (pitcher) but it was too late to make up for spoilt mood. I hope we have a better experience next time.",Rated 2.5,4,53,??

Well this venture of Priyank Sakhuja has made me speechless. In terms of decor & ambience this casual dining place is matchless. It's rooftop seating overlooking central CP is breathtaking. The medieval themed interiors are awesome and has Priyank's touch. However, I was a bit disappointed by the food and the drinks. We went by the Chef's choice for starters - Baby aloo was good but then what followed was pretty average. The non-veg platter was not up to the mark & vada pao was ok. One can pass that off. For the drinks we first ordered a LIT, which was bit overboard. But when Mohit took over he made us try different cocktails. Love them though. The bar in the terrace is where the action is and is the most beautiful part of the place. The ground floor has a bar too with good collection of drinks (you will get a nip/quarter too and at a very decent price). The dessert was good. One thing I stress upon in restaurants or bars is service. I liked the service of LOD. Food menu can do with some changes. But I will visit LOD again!! Love the terrace sitting.

The service is slow and I had to ask the waitors twice for a glass of water, though they are quite knowledgeable about the food items. The pasta is reasonably good and so was the salad. The mocktails are also the same, but none of them do justice to the astronomical prices.

Rahul Taluja,"Rated Unfortunately for me, everytime I have too much expectations from a place, I come out disappointed. That again happened with the LOD. When you enter the place, boom, you feel mesmerized. The place looks killer, especially the bar in the middle. This is easily one of the best places as far as ambiance is concerned and is huge with multiple seating areas. But sadly, thats where the good part ended for me. My first order was a Whisky and a Vodka and that took flat 15 minutes, that when I was sitting right next to the bar, not accepted. Worse, nobody served even water until then. This continued for another hour, had to sit idle for at least 10 minutes post every drink to order another. I eventually reached out to the manager and clearly offered to leave if they couldn't serve as what was more upsetting was that the table next to us had 10 men who were eating dinner and every server had their attention. Thankfully, the manager was an extremely sweet and courteous guy and the service was better post that. But then, we had already spent the maximum of our time until then. The manager also served us a free round of cocktails when he got to know it was my birthday and that was really sweet of him. Now the food - another let down and because of one simple and stupid factor - salt. Everything was salty - extremely salty. First thing we ordered was French Fries and thankfully they were spared from excessive salt. Next came Dahi Kebab where the salt issue cropped up, plus they were too oily and had too less dahi. Keema Pao could have been brilliant but again salt ripped it apart as was the case with Veg Noodles - again too salty. The Hookah lasted only 30 minutes with multiple issues with the pipe, we were seriously shocked that it got over in just 30 minutes. I am also aware that the same group owns Open and Warehouse cafe and I love their food, so I really hope this was a temporary issue and can be rectified soon. P.S. - this place is being promoted as a big time EDM place and that was a main reason I was here on my birthday as I am an EDM lover but in the 2 hours that I spent there, only 5 or 6 odd EDM tracks were played, so I hope the right expectations are set.",Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Sanyukta Gupta,"Rated Okay, so I went here today for a very special friends bday. Getting attracted to its name we wanted to see what's the hype all about. So here it is: Food: it would personally rate is a 2.5-3/5. The Italian was PATHETIC, they should get there chef replaced, BUT their Chinese is to die for, for 4 of us we had ordered a Aglio e Olio pasta which was below average, a tomato cream pene pasta which we sent back, a chilli paneer which was okayish, masala fries which were out of the world(4.5/5 a must must must try), mushroom and thyme soup which was again okayish and chilli garlic noodles and Vegetables in oyster sauce, that is something I would tell you guys to go and try without any doubt.. AMAZING is the word for their Chinese. Yes we had also ordered a 3cheese jalapeo sandwich which was good and good taste for veges HOOKA: we has ordered EX' on the beach little overpriced but you won't mind paying. That's all I have to say AMBIENCE: Now that's something I really was attracted to. We sat on rooftop which was amazing. Firstly we were seated downstairs, it was a very dull and discouraging ambience and environment so guys if you really wanna enjoy do just go for the rooftop. DRINKS: Sangria was PATHETIC, it was made fresh whereas Sangria should be soaked overnight,DO NOT ORDER SANGRIA, their watermelon vodka was a little sweet but good and smelled amazing and their was a cucumber with Gin drink don't exactly remember the name, that also tasted nice and yes for beer lovers, they have actually got ice chilled beers SERVICE: 5/5, now this is where I was seriously impressed. We got a very friendly and smiley waiter named Neeraj. He attend us 24*7 till the time we were there. Did not leave us for a second also. We had got the order changed and canceled did not create a fuss at all and was actually a nice person. We throughly enjoyed his company. I am giving 3.5 just because of his nice and no so full of attitude service. PRICE: 6000 for 4 I.e. 1500 per head in which food drinks alcohol redbull Diet Pepsi everything was there so I think it's pretty cheap for friends.

Nitin Mathur,"Rated Ever wanted to dine in the living room of the rich and filthy? Well then this is the place for you - it is huge, dark, laden with artifacts and has a gold hue. So march in but bring your own food :) :) Just kidding .. they have their highs and lows .. I had always wanted to go to this place mainly because I was attracted to the giant neon sign with their name written in a familiar font :) I finally got my chance on a Tuesday evening when me and my girlfriend went there with a friend. As mentioned before, it is dark, like open-your-eyes-wide-dark, but which gives you a sense that they mean business. Now with all the pomp they want to throw at your feet, they largely only have those big couches in the central area, which on a busy day would give you a royal feeling, but on a Tuesday evening it simply made the place seem rather dull. We settled for a small round table in another section, where it was easier to talk to or rather see one another :P We ordered some Dimsums which were fine and were served in a bamboo steamer (it may be a very common thing but .. I like) and some garlic tossed chicken sausages which were good too, but then there's not much that can go wrong with those. We then proceeded to order a Penne Alfredo which was dry and gummy. Then, because our friend from Mumbai wanted to taste some Delhi-Indian food, I ordered some Chicken Kali Mirch. Now, sometimes the look and feel of a restaurant tells you that it might not be a very good idea to order Indian food there .. ironical, yet true. Not that I didn't get the signs but maybe I was just too drunk to read them. Well, the pepper chicken was unsparing. It was hard, overcooked and just, plainly wrong. Now I had read some reviews before about the waiting staff not being too efficient. An hour into our dinner, they did mix up the orders. Normally I don't read too much into it, they have to remember so much and well, shit happens. But then on that evening, they were serving maybe 3 more tables besides us, so some effort there guys?!. But all said and done, I do have a real beef (oops..) to pick with you guys. Sangria is my guilty pleasure and I order it for my girlfriend so that I can drink half of it. And you ruined it. We get that it's not serious booze, but it's still more than apples apples apples apples and red wine !!!",Rated 2.0,1,0,??
Vasim Khichi,"Rated Big place and Nice interior thats all I can say about it . We went there in afternoon for small get together. As we entered there wasn't anyone to guide us to our seats so we had to find them ourself. We waited nearly 10-15 mins then had to scream at waiter to get us simply menu. Those people didn't even bothered to give menu . We ordered ice hoobo hookah, pasta mix Sauce, dal makhni and paneer makhni. Hookah was just ridiculous no smoke . They say it's made of ice but it was just normal hookah with ice like other restaurant serves. Food was served like social do. Pasta was too tangy, dal makhni and paneer was ok . We also tried shakes which were also ok. Also seems they overcharged us . Food bill was approx 2700 and after taxes it was approx 3700 nearly 40%. Funny thing was waiter just kept tray with food on table and went away . Won't ever come to this place again nor will recommend it.",Rated 1.0,13,17,??

Must give full credits to the interior designer.We ordered the peri peri chicken pizza, lamb pasta, and noodles. The food was good however service was slow. The service staff were helpful but were really busy and forgetful, that I feel more people should be hired by the establishment to improve service.

Rohit Kamboj,"Rated We had gone there for New Years Eve and i was totally disappointed with the place. To beginwith there was a lot of confusion at the entrance. We had to wait for 20 minutes for entrance after having prepaid passes. Once inside we could find a table easily as there were not many people but to our surprise the service that very very slow. There seemed to be nothing coming out of the kitchen at all. There was an endless call for drinks and food. The food menu was hopeless. For vegetarians like myself there were only french fries (Very oily) and paneer tikka! Imagine having paid a bomb (Rs8000/-) for a premium package, we were made to eat pototoes. On our repeated calls for food the waiter used to turn up with a small portion of fries and paneer tikka. Nothing else was ever served - disgusting. There was no main course planned for the evening. Coming on to the Entertianment- They said Nasha band would be playing Live sufi songs for the night. However the reality was that Akhil the lead singer from Nasha only showed up at 11.30pm and played for hardly 50mins. For the rest of the evening (before 11.30 and after 12.30) there was no DJ even playing anything. We were 6 couples to celebrate the eve only to realise that the place totally spolied our occasion and fun. I wont recommend the place to anyone at all. 9873656062",Rated 1.0,1,2,??

The moment you reach the entrance, there are these illuminated stairs leading you to the whole prodigious area, and the view leaves you awestruck! Ambiance is sexy in its true sense! Dim lights, huge arena, loud music, comfy seats/sofa and active staff! They have a separate smoking area which is a bonus for the people who smoke. Also the terrace seating arrangements are awesome! Large staff is another best thing as you don't have to wait endlessly to get their attention! Very prompt service! Coming to the food.. We were already full, so ordered just paneer BBQ.

Rohit Goyal,"Rated So we went for a new years eve party, and there were 8 of us. We paid 4k per person. We were told that all tables are on a first cum first serve basis. So we specifically made an effort to reach before 9. When we went there, we found most of the tables with a ""COMMITMENT"" tag. When we enquired with the manager, we were told that there are 12 owners, and most of the tables have been given to their relatives, friends or sold off by them. So thus began our search for a table when there were 20 tables empty. Speaking to bus boys, waiters, pleasing with them and what not. In the end, we had a manager find us a table next to the huge speakers on the terrace, with 1 chair for 8 ppl, at 9 pm, with nowhere else to go for nww years eve. I don't know how people who came in later, or were paying at the door, had a chance to get a table. In the end, we found some tables with the commitment tag still there, completely empty. So why were paying customers like us made to stand. They should have had a party for their owners only I guess. Not going again to this place. Food was alrite. Bartender wasn't giving out multiple drinks, and wanted the entire group to come to the bar to take their drink. So he wanted the entire group to leave the table, and come to the bar, when we had people standing like hawks near our table waiting for a chance to grab it.

So now I am detailing scene by scene what 1. We enter the restaurant and to our surprise no one attends us or makes us sit and feel comfortable. 2. We approach one of the staff members to help us with the a table for two only to get a cold response ""check up stairs, no space on this floor"" 3. Thinking that it might be just one of the instances we went upstairs hoping that someone will attend us. 4. Again we see no one comes to us. Rather once again we approach one of the staff members only to get a cold response ""All seats are occupied here. Please go down stairs"" 5. We decided not to wait any further. We just left the place. Well, as a customer, I do not accept the staff to be so cold and rude. As a customer, why should I be approaching your staff members when it should be vice versa. As a customer, I also, do not expect to be sent up and down without checking the availability of space. Is this what you define as hospitality. It'll be better if you do not forget that there are numerous options in the market willingly ready to server the customers in a far better way.

Prerna Prakash,Rated So after hearing so much about this place went to see what the hype was all about and honestly it was one of the most horrible experiences i have had....the place by itself is nice and the ambiance and the settling is good but thats all that is worth talking about... So we decided to meet up with a few friends and treat a friend visiting from China at this place considering we had heard some good things about it...So first 2 of us entered and had to wait a good 15-20 mins for someone to assist us with the seating... then we informed the manager that we will have an entire group coming in of about 10 people and would like to reserve 2 tables ...the first reaction of the manager was that stags are not allowed and we were left dumbstuck...all the tables which were occupied then and later were stags so i am not sure why we were misinformed...somehow after arguing with them that its a group of friends that we are expecting we cannot have equal number of males and females we managed to reserve 2 tables... then comes the service-horrible horrible horrible...we had to keep calling the waiters again and again for them to even ARRIVE at our table...and when they finally did some of them had no idea about what the dishes on their menu were...we asked for details on some of the cocktails and we were answered with a blank look...finally we got so fed up that we had to walk up to the bar to check with the bartender what the drink was....and to top it all the reason we went there was OLD MONK and it wasnt available...as per them they were out of stock the previous day itself...so much for keeping things on the menu when they are not available.... so first we ordered some bacardi and beer as we didnt have much of a choice ....because half the things were not available...We ordered a portion of piri piri chicken which was on the lines of the chicken wings and i am sure we can get better from the local road side restaurants however we didnt expect much on the food anyways from a drinking place...anyways after numerous million attempts to grab the attention of the waiters we managed to order our second round of drinks... once our group joined in...it was a mayhem...no one bothered to clean the table...even though we repeatedly kept asking them..each time the answer being just give us 5 mins which never came....we had a few mocktails and cocktails along with beers and bacardi but each time had to walk up to the bar to know what the drink consisted of...we then ordered some food as there was no point trying to get to another place with it being a weekend...we ordered chicken koyla kebab and chicken curry with tandoori rotis...the food was cold and tasteless...the chicken curry was watery and the rotis were cold....

Vanya Rajput,"Rated The waiters here have more airs than a teen princess at a slumber party. The matre d' at the entrance was high on something so potent Snoop dog would have wanted it and gave us a look so blank on being asked if there were tables available upstairs that he would have given mannequins some major complex. Exasperated after my fifth fruitless try of getting an answer out of this humanoid, we pushed past and reached upstairs. Here we met a guy (probably the manager) who finally talked coherently and told us we can go upstairs as there were plenty of seats at the terrace. I already had half a mind to go back and shake some sense into that fantastic first impression of a person. On going upstairs we could see plenty of empty spaces but they were all as you can guess ""Reserved"" for ghosts. On asking that we were ready to wait at the bar until a space opens up we were very gruffly told that it was not an option. The waiter must have had a sudden bout of compassion and offered us a five seater space for seven people. On pointing out the obviousness of basic mathematics we were told "" Arrey madam isme to hum 8 log bhi bitha dete hain"".. *slow clap*. Anyway, we scooched in somehow and had to leave individual seats for our 6 foot plus male company which was oblivious to our sorry asses. Also you will have to chase the waiters and convince them to take your order. Food is average so are the drinks. Ambiance is great. Oh and we wanted to wrap up with a round of tequila shots so that's what we said to the guy, we will have 7 tequila shots. Later, on being handed the bill we realized that the final round cost us four grand! The guy did not once ask our preference or showed the menu, he simply got us the most expensive tequila he had on his menu! Such a smooth guy. So to end the story: Not going again for sure.

MOVISH,"Rated Sunday night in Central Delhi, looking for a nice place to grab a few drinks and a quick bite ,made me zero down on LOTD, bookmarked since many weeks.The three of us were totally smitten by the ATMOSPHERE -the ambience, the mood,the vibe of this place.You feel transported to another era, with medieval trimmings of body armours n swords,made familiar by the movie trilogy(Lord of the Rings) on which the decor theme is based. The huge space is demarcated into a bar area, seating around the DJ/ performance area ,some quiet ,cosy corners and a wonderful alfresco dining space on the terrace.There's something for everyone here. We ORDERED a Thai Stir Fried Paneer - batter fried Paneer with a miniscule quantity of veggies despite the request that we wanted less paneer n more veggies.The Drums of Heaven , Barbeque Mushroom Pizza and Veg Hakka Noodles were all very mediocre taste wise ; nothing our tastebuds could be delighted with.Infact ,the Thai style Paneer n Chicken Drumsticks had a distinct floury taste despite being deep fried.Still,I ll say the food was passable. What was unforgiving was the bad COCKTAILS. I tried a Berry Cosmopolitan and a Strawberry and Beer Margarita. Both were bad...had to send back the latter n get it replaced by a Classic Margarita. We also had a shot of Campari as an aperitif and a glass of Cabernet Shiraz ,which we didn't enjoy much. Contrary to experiences of numerous other Foodies,we were very satisfied with the SERVICE .It was prompt, attentive and courteous, despite the place being packed to capacity. The food and drinks are very reasonably priced so the place was full of large groups partying hard.The music was not to my taste the night we went but I hope they play different genres everyday. I d like to experience this place one more time simply because I loved the vibe and want to try some more dishes n drinks before I finally decide whether it will make the cut to my list of favorites.Till then it will be a 3/5 on the MOVILICIOUS METRE.",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Wide variety of food (indian, european, mexican, american, chinese) Ambience on the terrace is very good, and the sofa seating is comfortable. Music on the terrace is not too loud, so one can easily have conversations. Negatives- The food is monotonous. It has a lot of options but nothing really extraordinary to eat.

Even when i asked waiters twice to check if we could move to the outdoor seating..they failed to come back with a reply..and ultimately i had to get up and find the manager just for a simple thing as moving outside.. Even once outside..the seats for two were those really high tables which weren't comfortable at all.. That being said.. The ambience is actually pretty good.. Even outdoors the view is quite decent.. So coming to the food.. We tried chikken tikka pizza which was decent enough though nothing extraordinary.. And masala cheese fries which are a definite fail.. So ya not the great food that i expected and hoped for..but still scores a 3 for me coz considering the location and ambience and all, it is a pretty reasonably priced place..",Rated 3.0,23,55,??
Shyamaj Bajpai,Rated Food was awesome. Ambience was awesome. But the service was very slow after the first order. Expect to wait for your next round of beer to be 20 minutes late every time including when you have pestered the waiter 3-4 times reminding him about your order. Even the bill took 20 minutes to reach me. Whole experience was let down due to the service. Will go there again just to show someone new around. Will prefer The Vault cafe any day over this.But a must one time visit place.,Rated 3.0,7,11,??

Drinks under the moonlight on the rooftop on a chilly night, or in the yellow light backdrop on the floor below makes you feel elated and peps up the mood. The music is great and so is the food, not only because of the taste but the portions were also considerably large. The place is really a treat to the eyes and economical too(drinks especially beers) and hence a great place to party with a group of friends.

Radhika Roy,"Rated Lord of the Drinks does give you the impression that the decor will be something along the lines of Lord of the Rings. However, that's not true. Except for maybe a sword, there was hardly anything LoTR-like here. But, yes, there is a very medieval feeling attached to this place. We decided to sit on the rooftop. One thing I'd like to point out is that, the staircase stinks. I don't know if it was for that very day, but the stench was unbearable. They should definitely look into that. But, the rooftop is beautiful. If you're visiting this place, please do go and sit on the rooftop. The music is playful (mostly remixes of popular Western songs). Overall, the ambience is quite nice for a little snacks and drinks. Coming to the food, we ordered Masala Cheese Fries, Teekha Chicken Tikka, Peri Peri Chicken and, Ham and Bacon Mac N Cheese. For drinks, we settled for a six pack of Heineken. They didn't really have many choices of beer available, which was a pity. The food came pretty fast. The biggest plus point goes to the quantity. There was no skimping when it came to the food. In fact, the Mac N Cheese seemed almost bottomless. Absolutely loved it and we were pretty impressed by it. All the items we ordered are a must-try. The chicken was succulent and fresh, the fries were huge and cheesy, and the Mac N Cheese was marvellous. The servers were very helpful and courteous, and the bill came up to about 3300, which is quite decent for a six pack and so much of food. They should just do something about that awful smell, otherwise it was a good experience. Rating is 3.5 just because there is not much to do with LoTR.",Rated 3.5,49,459,??
Adhiratna Jha,"Rated The name of the restaurant is what attracted me to this place. But as soon as I entered it, I felt like I entered the Warehouse Cafe (similar restaurant in Cannaught Place). Absolutely similar ambiance, with similar lighting, and similar music going on. Food is good, but alcohol is not upto its name. Even though my friends and I tried at least 4-5 types of cocktails and dry shots, non seemed to have any effect on me or my friends; it was like we were drinking mocktails only. But anyways, since the food was good, the time was well spent. But I would rather go to Warehouse than come to this place again.",Rated 3.0,10,1,??

Shivani,"Rated I think Ill be prompt to give a sense of where I am going with this review- I really liked this place and I think it is pretty amazing. The first time I ever visited this place was by pure luck and no planning at all. I did not correctly anticipate how big this place would be and the dcor/ whole setting is amazing. The place has a little bit of everything when it comes to the ambience. The lower floor of the joint is done with great taste and if sitting there one definitely gets a sense of being somewhere not in New Delhi or anywhere Delhi for that matter. The terrace area is also great and it does have the classic under the night moon/ bright sun feel. This goes for both the inside terrace as well as the outside balcony area with a partial view of CP. The music can get loud but the staff is very accommodating, in that they seat you where you think the sound is viable for your senses (at least for us they did). Lets come to the food and the drinks; and to begin Id like to say I really liked (again) everything. The first time drinks order comprised of a Warriors Favourite, a classic mojito and a classic cosmopolitan. The cosmo and mojito were classic as stated and the other one was quite good. The food order included Chermoula Vegetables and a tomato cream penne. I was with a friend who is sort of finicky when it comes to trying out/ attempting to cook the food she likes on her own. So we both absolutely loved the Chermoula veggies and needless to say she scoped the net for a recipe of the same. So that says a lot about the dish. The Pasta was also great and they serve good portions which is again a plus. I dont know why but I do feel like giving the black tissues a special note; just goes to show how every detail has been thought through. All in all- will visit them again and again and again.",Rated 4.0,18,31,??

Gayatri Ashta,"Rated What a bar! Loved it. Stepping into Lord of the Drinks, we made our way to the rooftop which has wonderful lighting and a beautiful view of the stars. While other reviewers have mentioned cocktails as their specialty, I'd suggest against this if you're not looking to spend too much. Stick to beers, and your pocket will be much happy. In fact, with INR 85 for a kingfisher pint, I don't see why you'd want to go in for anything else. And the food! Wow. I ordered the fries loaded with pork and bacon. It was phenomenal and very filling. The bacon and pork just melted in my mouth and the additional dressing just balanced out the flavour. My mouth waters just thinking of that dish. We also went ahead and ordered the Bacon and Pulled Pork Sandwich. It was grilled and they'd been nice enough to remove the crusts. They definitely know what their customers want. Since it was the middle of December, it became a little cold after a while, and we retired to the enclosed area, where the music and warmth made us feel right there at home. The service is impeccable, music upbeat and the latest on big hits, food is scrumptious and beer prices awesome. All in all, coming here is the best decision you'll make if you're looking for a fun night out.",Rated 4.5,52,747,??

Eat Style Shop,"Rated For a friends birthday party I went to Lord of the Drinks. It was a bright sunny day but as soon as I entered the cafe it was quite dark. I honestly dont like very dark places. I cant say it was well-lit but it might be a nice place for a Saturday night out as it is no less than a club. Loud music, college-goers and a big group of people having parties is what this place is ideally for. Moving on we ordered quite a mix of food and I must say that all of it was delicious something I didnt like here was their service. The hospitality and service was slow and lazy. Even after prior information and booking they didnt seem well prepared. We ordered pasta, quesadillas, nachos, crispy wontons, drums of heaven, iced tea, mojito and a few alcoholic drinks.

Me and my friends went for the very first time, Saturday evening it was and moving on the terrace was one great option we ordered drinks with fish fingers and nachos, waiters seemed unpleasant as if they were not getting their pay, I asked 3 different waiters for salsa sauce no body took the pain to bring that on our table, finally we conducted an intervention called the manager. So it was getting chilly we asked them for a indoor sitting after an hour someone from the staff came and said you can only move once you pay the bill in here, again calling the manager was the only option left, we finally moved downstairs for indoor sitting.Overall very bad experienceDecor: Staircase was stinky. Indoor sitting was good, Plates were dirty, the bucket in which they served us beers was one dirty bucket no even bothered to wipe it all stains.Food: After all those filthy incident I would not say the saviour was food 2 out of 5.Staff: Definitely they should get some lesson.I have already given my feedback to customer relationship Manager then and there only .

They don't understand ""beer in mugs with lime slices in them"", not even ""on the rocks"", and also not ""lemon concentrate"" to top the scotch or how much quantity is in ""double shots in glasses"". And the most important blunder or cheating, I'm sure that we were not served glenfiditch as ordered but some cheaper substitute. We have tried this high end scotch and what we were served tasted nothing like it. The couldn't even maintain speedy Service of beer orders despite the place being literally empty of other customers.

The cocktail menu had a variety of drinks LIT ,MARTINI etc had four variants.But being an avid drinker i didnt find any sort of taste in those drinks i even think they put less alcohol in them. Worst drink was mango mania even a cough syrup taste better. So we all ended up drinking beer to my surprise the beer tube which they bought was filled with foam till 15 cm.

Kaveri Dhar,"Rated So this had been on my to-visit list for quite some time now. And finally, on a pleasant sunday afternoon, I went here with a group of five. Decor: The decor is nice, a little dark, but if you're fan of dark orange-ish places you'll like it. I liked it. Not worth the hype that some reviews had created but decent. Music: Then coming to the music, the playlist comprised mostly of Linkin Park songs. Music could have been a little upbeat. However we went during the day, and maybe at night they have a better DJ. Can't comment on that as I'm not sure. Food: We ordered Tomato cream pasta, veg hakka Noodles, Kentucky style fried chicken, murgh malai tikka and plain fries. Fries, Tomato cream pasta and Hakka noodles were decent. Not something to die for, but not even too bad. Murgh Malai tikka was really nice. The chicken was tender and cooked to perfection. The problem was with the Kentucky style fried chicken. It was majorly disappointing. Kentucky style fried chicken usually reminds me of KFC's hot and crispy chicken, and though I do understand that it must be difficult to live up to that taste (Me being a KFC fan here). But if you're trying to copy it, there has to be some match. In LOD's case, the preparation was too bland. Chicken well cooked but devoid of any spice. The dips were good and served as a nice accompaniment to the fries. Drinks: So if you name it Lord of the 'Drinks', you better be the Lord. But this wasn't. Pitchers for most beers were not available. So we decided to skip beer n go for Rum n coke (aah winters), but guess what, Old Monk wasn't available either. We didn't try the cocktails because we got very disappointed because of the unavailability of most brands. We ended up having one beer each (Hoegaarden and Kingfisher), and left. Staff: Polite and courteous. No complaints here. Overall review: So it has a nice ambience and some good food, but that alone can't help the place. I had high expectations and low returns. A classic case of 'Unchhi dukaan, fike pakwaan'.",Rated 3.0,4,250,??

Samrat Chakravorty,"Rated Lord of the Drinks has been in my to visit list for long, finally yesterday managed to experience this place. Every aspect of this place is so artistically done, right from the entrance, the dark dungeons stairs lined by heavy chains, the amazingly spacious sitting area, they loaded bar counter to the amazing terrace sitting providing a lovely view of CP. I got myself a seat at the bar itself, getting a good overall view and enjoying the cocktail making. The bar was super impressive. The whole place is so beautifully lit by ambient lighting, you can't help but keep clicking. We ordered for Bira 91, Chili Vodka and Lords Martini in drinks, and Chicken wings, Loaded Masala cheese fries and Pasta. The cocktails were really enjoyable, very tastefully made. Loved the food too, the pasta was pretty tangy. Enjoyed veg more than non veg though, the chicken wings I asked to be made spicy, it wasn't at all. Then went upstairs to enjoy the spectacular terrace view of CP. Overall had a hell of an evening. With so many bar and cafe options in CP, this place definitely stands out in every aspect.",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Prawn Calemanjoro ( I hope that was it) was excellent and so was Lamb kebabs. But the crispy chicken was okay and ditto for stir fried chicken. The green apple chilly slush was bad.

The inside seating and the inner terrace seating is perfect for a large group of friends but in small groups, the outer terrace, with a direct view of the tricolour flag and the rest of CP, is the ultimate spot. I visited this outlet on a winter night and took a table on the outer terrace, where each table had a floating candle in a glass(so essentially, a candle light dinner; great place for couples I think). We ordered 2 pitchers of beer, 1 mango mania, lamb nachos and chicken stroganoff. The food was Fantabulous esp. the Stroganoff which was served with rice. The nachos were also very good. The cocktail was tasty too. Now coming to the music, decor and ambience; they were impeccable. The service was quick and our server was polite and well informed.

Rishabh Khullar,"Rated So i was thr last week with my wife n frnz, we got the table on terrace which is huge and looks awsm specially in winters. The whole place is huge actually with ambience designed to make u wanna hv drinks nd chill n njy the food. We were a group of 9 and i think this place is appt for a larger group of ppl. We ordered : 1) lit pitchers with coke and red bull, 3 each - one pitcher served 4 glasses, it tasted good but it wasn't strong at all, despite of continuously telling the server to ask the bar tender to make it strong. I think that night management was trying to fetch out the rent by serving fake pitchers of lit which is really sad. 2) strawberry and mango daiquiri - it tasted good but again it lacked that punch of alcohol which is again disappointing. 3) hookas - we ordered 3 diff hooka just to try the diff flavours and coz we were too many. 4) veg / Nonveg platter - portion was good but no taste at all, not worth it. 5) piri piri chicken and cheese cottage pizza - i liked this one and portion was good enough. 6) chicken dim sums - i really liked these, they were perfect in portion and filling, really yummy. 7) pesto pasta spaghetti - It tasted good but portion was small. We paid a bill of Rs 24k, which is 3k per person, somehow the place doesn't feel worth that money coz thr are many places serving good food and drinks in reasonable amount of money. Over all i think its a one time visit place if u are in a big group and u dont wanna expect much from food and specially for drinks just go for beers or whisky or malts. I gave it a ratting of 3 only coz of its ambience, dimsums, pizza and hooka.",Rated 3.0,42,64,??

As you enter u get the feeling of old vintage area which relax ur mind and chill out. Service is very good as its huge so maintaing that much of crowd is difficult but its well managed by the staff. We ordered 4 cheese pizza, mutton balls masala peanuts and khaleel hookah. I cn say the food quality is just worse of it. Please dnt try out for food.

Its a hotspot with Retro music, mammoth cocktail list, delicious tapas and artistic interiors including priceless collectors' swords! What really makes 'Lord Of The Drinks distinct is its cuisine. I wanted to try something really basic and at the same time my favorite too so I ordered a mushroom crostini and smoked chicken bruschetta. Both were light, layered, flavourful. This was followed by Mumbais tried and tasted finger lickin' delicious keema pav; Up next was 'Stuffed Chicken Breast' which was well prepared and balanced with taste & texture, as I am a mutton lover I wanted something different and juicy so the next on my plate was 'Lamb Bulgogi' - the shredded lamb poached in chilli paste and sesame oil rendered it light and moist, slow cooking it released and maintained natural flavours and juices from this succulent lamb. With larger than life vision Priyank Sukhija shown a passionate feast of the senses with the overlooking bar, a long communal table set-up in a lively ambience and a huge pool table in a corner, meticulous service, well-priced cocktails and tapas makes ' Lord Of The Drinks' a huge hit among all other!

Another good view of this place is that no matter where you sit whether in a group or a couple you can have ur own space. The staff seems very alert and courteous. Their food and drinks menu has a good range of options. We ordered for masala chilli cheese fries which were good. Their dahi ke kebab where very very delicious very aptly prepared. Lasagne was average. They have a vast drink menu but i would still suggest choose wisely as per your taste. As per cost i found the place fine not very expensive not very cheap.

Neha R. Sood,"Rated This place has ""priyank sukhija"" written all over it. The decor, the menu, the ambiance but shocking would be service and food. For the first time I have seen Service at any of priyank's venture to be below average with lot more freshers and little expertise around. Food as well was quite a shock because that's not we are used to. To begin with the masala fries were served cold though the soups were good. The drinks were made with a handbook and no innovation from the bartender whatsoever. Rarely happens that a cocktail you have ordered isn't available. The crispy vegetables were high on salt and garlic bread was oily. Food - 2/5 Service - 2/5 Ambiance - 3.5/5 Adding an additional 0.5 for the decor and placement of the restaurant. Note to the management: When guests enter the place after their hard day at work or wherever, they want to relax.

The downside maybe that the staff is a little clueless.. And probably a little lost. I ordered a strawberry and beer margarita and they got me a classic margarita.

Shrey Kumar Singh,"Rated The place has simply pathetic experience !!! So I'll start with the good.... The place has very nice ambiance !! U'll feel the class at this place with elite and nice interiors and sophisticated feeling.... And that's all that is good here... The food is very average and not at all worth visiting twice for food.... The worst thing about this place is the service.... U call it novice or whatever but the staff has very limited knowledge.... So we asked for a dish to be made spicy and they served it sweet and the best thing is they have no idea which table made the order... Believe you me, no exaggerating, in my span of 60 mins the different staff served me 3 times the dish which was orders for some other table every time.... So this is gross mismanagement and then at the end we tried to pay through an app which they highlighted that are onboard with but the payment took atleast 30 mins to finish and we had to wait and wait.... So yes the ambiance n feel is nice but I won't recommend this place at all coz of the disappointing service !!!! PS: I asked the manager for the feedback book and he got me a pre filled one and asked me to sign and when I mentioned it's filled he said sorry will change and never returned !!!",Rated 1.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The music seemed nice in one section of the restaurant but they gave us a place in another section, where the music started playing only a little before the time we were leaving. To drink, I had a Fruit Punch (which was nice) and a Virgin Mojito (which tasted more like sugar syrup!). Tried their Lamb Nachos, and Pork and Bacon Fries. Both the items were above average. Also, at the end, I wanted to pay through Ruplee (which allows for a discount), and which they had advertised all over that they accept. But they denied saying the concerned person wasn't there.

The iced tea was fresh and so was the beer(apparently as per my friend, I don't have a taste for beer really). The place is super dark but the music is really good.

The manager was no where to be seen. The guy sitting at the entrance is rude and flatly refused to accept that there are empty tables upstairs.. Absolutely unbelievable place where you have to chase waiters to get a table and god forbid if you sit at an empty table some one would come and tell you that it is reserved . Never going back here again.. I tried to speak to the manager but no one seem to knew where he was... The place is an absolute chaos.. Never had a worse experience at a place across India.

So it was afternoon when we went in there we were four and the only thing we wanted was beer and as far as i remember that i had ordered 4 beers and at that time the waiter didn't say anything but after 15 min when i called him again he told me we dont have any domestic beer and you can have imported ones i was like why is this even called lord of the drinks when it wasn't even having beer secondly the beer menu was too short not much variety and the moment was ruined. So we settled down with just three things from the menu Drum of heaven from chinese cuisine and yes they were nice nicely plated well made chicken and tasty thats all one wanna know. And two LIIT drinks Adam's Liit and power stroke both were different if you want to have something strong then go for power stroke and if you are want your drink to be less bitter then go for adam's liit it's lemony taste and watermelon punch will refresh you so from service view it was bad experience and from food point of view it was good.,Rated 3.0,39,261,??

Baby fried potatoes was just ok, rest of the items were good, nicely cooked and served. Drinks : Had a bucket of beers, 1 bottle of 100Pipers and a martini for the lady.

We ordered chicken tikka which was ok ok. Except that pizza was pathetic so was pasta which was under cooked. Then we ordered grilled chicken to much of our surprise it was not even half cooked, when we complained & after requesting to waiters for manager plenty of time, he finally arrived & told us that chicken is perfectly cooked, although it was not less then rubber which we weren't able to chew at all. We asked them to cancel the dish & provide us with the bill, but we were presented with the same dish again. When we returned it, we were presented with bill in which the item was charged.

DJ911,"Rated The day next to diwali, one of my friend came from lucknow and had to catch train from New Delhi. Again I had 2-3 hours to spent before dropping him to station(last week one other fren came from Canada and paid short visit). This time I was pretty sure to visit Lord of the drinks. Since we were short of time quickly i parked car and directly went LOTD. Now came a shocker that floaters/Sandals not allowed, I knew and had read somewhere that they have shoes only policy during weekend but it was thrusday! We spoke to guy sitting at counter and asked if these are written rules or just verbal. He told these are recent rule changes, we asked him to clarify once again with someone senior. He rang a phone and then told us we can go inside(it was 7PM, I am pretty sure if it was late he wouldn't allow us as we were stag) and rule was only for weekend. Now the theme to LOTD is pretty good and they have large seating along with rooftop. Since rooftop was full we sat in closed area. Not wasting time we asked for non-veg platter along with Heineken and double shots of 100 pipers. Platter was okay not bad and not something to be praised loudly. The crowd was real cool, you could see guys gals hanging out and having fun. They have a smoking area too else you can sit at rooftop. Music was good which was going very well with the drinks. Finally with another round to drinks we had to leave. While leaving we were told that weekends stags are not allowed! Perfect place for couples who like drinks and music(not a eatery).

Couple of things that disappointed me - 1. Service is pathetic . We kept waiting for the waiter to arrive and also they took 20 mins to get the cheque . I had to get up and ask them to bring the cheque 2. Food is just very average 3. While we were waiting for our table , we stood at the bar and ordered our drinks ... Most irritating part was that they were clearing the cheque after every order which is usually not there at other places ... They should keep the card and keep the order running . Also they refused to take the order for food at the bar which is again very unusual ... This rating is only because of the ambience and location .

We also ordered a hukka and two dishes - one was Creme Pasta and other was some type of fries. The first round of hukka, beer pints and pasta arrived quickly but from then on it was a long wait for everything else. To get our next round of drinks and fries it took them an eternity.

When I complained about it, I received a stupid reply from the waiter, ""This is the standard. 45 ml alcohol. Cant do anything about it"". The staff is really useless and unfriendly here.

First lets talk about the ambiance...its typically designed in such a manner that it will give u the feeling of a warrior. The warrior helmets and the lighting like it used to be in the old times in the castles. This place is typically for the people who loves drinking. Seating is quite comfortable and they have huge space. They have terrace seating also for people who love to drink on terrace ;) Music is rocking and generally English songs re played both old and new. Staff is very efficient in there work and quick also. U can wear the warrior helmets and give urself the feeling of a warrior or a gladiator. They also serve hookah which is also amazing.

SamB,"Rated Well to begin with I really wanted to visit this Bar/Restaurant hearing about the place and reviews. So come Saturday afternoon visited the place with a bunch of friends and here is my take. 1. At the gate couple of guys were denied entry as they were stags only, policy only couple entry(which world are we living in a Bar/Restaurant bang in the afternoon and no stags. Ok buy your point as it might be a strict policy, but then inside the restaurant there were many stags only group..Really Strange - Live what you say 2. Service - The worst service ever, the waiters did not even understand their own Menu , A) Tenderloin Steak with Bacon infused Mashed Potato and Rosemany Jus - once ordered, they asked my do i want the mash and what Jus or infact Gravy I want B) Nutella & Nuts Shake thats what i ordered - Peanut Butter shake is what i got saying this is Nutella - can someone tell them Nutella is dark brown in colour and tastes different from Peanut Butter, C) Bira91 beer I wanted a bottle of it but the waiter suggested Draught version - horrible, tastes like Beer mixed with water - no fiz at all I mean seriously D) Lasagne - Ordered at 2.50 PM, arrived at 4:05 PM - I mean did you have to visit the market to grab ingredients The plus point is ONLY & ONLY the Decor...oh i liked the Adams LIIT so have to mention. BTW the food tasted horrible, stale bread as a base for Mushroom Crostini forgot to mention earlier..",Rated 2.5,16,2,??

Minaz Ranjita Singh,"Rated I would say this is the ultimate chilling place, which has lived upto its hype! It made my trip to Delhi way too memorable. The place is huge with a sexy ambience and real good music. Hard to get a reservation, since it is trending this week. So, we started drinking by the bar and then got a table later on. There was this one shot i would like to mention which was worth repeating, kamakazhi; others were fine. We had ordered the loaded fries with sausage and onions which was the best complement with the drinks. Next, we ordered the fish and chips which was worth it and finally we ended with a lamb burger which was too huge to finish when you are already full. Also, had a little dance at the end with total strangers(the crowd was real good including me ). All in all, it definitely is the Lord of the Drinks.",Rated 4.5,11,80,??

RaJat AhuJa,"Rated Okay a long lasting review for this one . Was here to celebrate one of my friends bday on a Sunday evening. The place was completely full so we had to wait for around 10 mins. As one enters the place can have the feel of the complete theme based on ancient Greek of can say one can get into the movie lord of the rings. The place is spread at its best. It was Sunday evening so evenly crowded full of noises and music. Starting with our order we decided to go for dahi k kabab , chilli chicken, veg brushetta and a veg delight pizza along with it we ordered beer for all and sheesha. The service is a bit slow , if with group can be ignored. As our order came one by one dahi k kabab were not cooked properly so on complaining they got that changed. Brushetta was too stuffed with mashed potatoes rather than our expectation of being it filled with vegetables. Chilli chicken tasted good and lastly the veg delight pizza which was actually good thin crust + the way it was baked. They have a separate sheesha guy who keeps the flame alive.

Anish Kohli,"Rated Great Great Place...!!!! Well, I decided to try this place on a lazy Saturday afternoon for Lunch with friends. We went here looking for a good place, some decent food and a fun time. Well, we were not disappointed even 1 tiny bit. Let me start from the begining... This place is so damn easy to locate. It is right at the outer circle with such big boards saying Lord Of The Drinks that you cant miss it..!! Since I planned to have an early lunch, I reached the place at around 1:15 ish and we were seated by around 1:30 as there was not a lot of crowd and the choice of tables was open, which I happened to switch 3 times ;) The place is huge with a great sitting capacity but not at the cost of privacy. All the tables are very well spaced, so that you aren't cramped for room and can enjoy yourself. The ambience is great with some good music that isn't too loud like at My Bar Headquaters, the lights dimmed just right so that it isn't dark to interfere with your experience. Overall a great feel to make you relaxed. Now coming onto food, we ordered: 1. Chicken Wings in BBQ Sauce 2. Drums of Heaven 3. Tomato Cream Penne Pasta 4. Herbed Chicken Mac'n Cheese 5. Fries with Onions and Chicken Sausage 6. Bhatti Panner 7. Assorted Drinks The Food was awesome. Just Great...!!!! The highlights were: i) Chicken Wings in BBQ Sauce were simply Brilliant, loved them totally...!! ii) Bhatti Paneer was good and the green chutney served with it was out of the world. iii) This was my first time with Mac'n Cheese, so with nothing to compare it to, I'd say it was very nicely done. Rest of the food was also very good. Nothing disappointed at all. The food was served fresh and hot and the drinks were chilled. The staff was very nice, attentive and helpful. What's more, is they knew when and how to maintain the distance. I would like to add that this place is very very well priced. Its not cheap enough to make it your local haunt while it isn't so overly priced as to make you re-think before you visit/revisit. I'm highly satisfied and would say that it is a MUST VISIT place :) :)",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Deepika Zaweria,Rated Been there few days back. The place was quite good to visit again. The First thing you will noticed about the place that its Very spacious in comparison to other Joints in CP. Music was also good and not too loud..as in people can talk and enjoy the music at the same point of time.But the quantity of food is quite less in comparison to the price we paid.

One thing I want to highlight that I found some error in the billing. Since we were 4 friends, so we have to split the bill and at that time I saw calculation error. They have charged more when VAT was calculated. So, guys I know it would sound lame to check a computer generated bill on your calculator but please do once and raise the concern there itself.

Jatin Dev,"Rated Most bars in Delhi can offer you either an experience of trading floor or can burn a hole in your pocket! This one clearly stands apart. The seats are comfortable and wonderfully spaced apart. (The roof patio is a different story) Lightening is dim but not gloomy and music is well volumed to have a normal conversation even with the person sitting opposite to you. The food menu is very linear i.e. everything is of similar price, so order anything ( A good and a bad thing ) The service is a little slow but very well mannered w.r.t. most competitor bars.

Despite the place being almost half-empty, he double-booked our table, and was extremely rude and unapologetic about it! The other guests were more embarrassed about the situation then him! I have to say that this is an extremely competitive market with a new entrant every week, and unless they pull up their socks, they will end up losing business from people who like to be treated courteously and with respect. Can't comment on the food or indeed the drinks as we opted to walk out and go to one of our more trusted places nearby and get a table without any grief.

They have an option of indoors as well as a terrace seating which comes fitted with large standalone fans which never make u sweat or tizzy in the heat and in winters it would be amazing to be seated up there. The staff is very courteous and helped us choose some amazing starters for our drinking buddies. We had ordered draught beer along with cheesy nachos, chicken peri peri pizza, the prawn pizza, thai chicken tossed in wok and the mexican fried chicken.

Twice we were served the wrong order and one of our servers even tried ro convince me that the paneer in my non veg club sandwich was infact, chicken :D .

Robinson Raju,"Rated Last month, I fatefully and fatally decided to walk into a 'new kid [/bar] on the block the audaciously named The Lord of the Drinks lettered surprisingly in the same font that HarperCollins used on the cover page of one of its editions of JRR Tolkiens iconic and genre-defining trilogy (although the use of the font did rattle my publisher self slightly, but I swallowed the feeling because the promise of discovering something quaint and unique seemed more reasonable). That night, I was wearing a grey Mandarin-collared shirt, black trousers and brown slippers. I was greeted warmly by the waiters and bartenders, and sat on the bar counter. Looking around, I saw the place was done up tastefully dummy armors of Middle-earth warriors, lush seating and a good looking bar. I ate a meaty tenderloin steak, which was surprisingly quite luscious. I did end up liking the place (not in a blowing away of the senses kind of way) although as an LOTR fan, I was sorely disappointed. I was perhaps expecting too much given the name (and the font used) of the place. The only thing I was least expecting, however, was to be turned away and not be allowed to enter two days later when I came back with a friend. This time I was wearing a green faded kurta (perhaps withering at the seams), blue faded jeans (perhaps torn at the ends) but the same brown slippers I wore last time. Slippers not allowed! I heard the bouncer at the entrance say, rudely sticking his hand out to hinder my entering the flight of stairs. He scanned me top to bottom, and seemed to be doing some kind of mental analysis perhaps to judge my suitability to enter this LOTR club, while I was mentally distinguishing a watering hole from a members only club. Dumbfounded and taken shockingly aback, I protested, But I was here two days ago in these very slippers! All I saw was a shake of his head and the hand still stuck out. I retraced my steps, looked up and saw an equally dumbfounded look on my friends face. All I could think about then was Arent hobbits always barefooted?",Rated 1.0,2,12,??

Somya Sharma,"Rated My first review on Zomato and it couldn't have been an opportune time to do so. Went to Lord of the Drinks on 31st Oct'15 with a few expat colleagues and it turned out to be an apt decision. Starting with customer centricity, Mohit at the gate along with his team were extremely courteous and went an extra mile to ensure that our needs were catered to. The staff constantly checked on us to ensure that we were having a good time and Mohit even organized a table / bar service despite the place being packed to the rafters. Moving to food/drinks/the likes, we ordered multiple rounds of beers, sheesha, caprioska, chicken tikka, mutton seekh kebab and a mutton biryani. Suffice to say, even Raphi (my expat colleague) ended up licking his fingers and all the dishes were devoured in a span of 10 mins of serving. Only improvement area was the fact that our 'caprioska' could've been supplemented with slightly more liquor than ice/water. Highly recommended place to visit for individuals from all walks of life - Few recommendations: 1- Please be prepared for some waiting time at the valet to park and to get your car on return given that this place is located at a busy crossroads. 2- Dress appropriately to avoid being denied entry 3- Tip Well if you like the service :D",Rated 5.0,4,25,??

So at 7, I find myself sitting at the open terrace seating of this wonderful place. The biggest USP of this place is the amazing ambience. They have a fairly large area and they have utilised in a good way. The dim lighting, separate areas for the group size you're in, the quirky add-ons throughout the place really give it a nice feel. Coming to the drinks and food. The draught beer variety is good and the beer tastes well. The food is also great and the waiter recommended it as per the choice of drinks.

Arun Tyagi,"Rated OK, so here we go... Lord of the Drinks, sounds a lot like a Middle-Age Era, epic drinking heaven. Sadly, far from reality. I decided to take my team out for a Corporate outing to Cannaught Place and as suggested by a friend, booked a table for 6-7 people at ""The Lord of the Drinks"", on the evening of 1st of November, 2015. The place's ambiance and set-up was relatively attractive and spacious, especially the terrace. The service however, were next to pathetic. The experience left us with a tinge short of fury for having paid a bill of 10k for barely 5 people, which is just fine. The trouble began before the first order at the table itself. The Manager at the time told us they only accept ""Couple guests"" to the restaurant and that ""Stags"" are not permitted inside. Excuse me?? More than half of the guests were ""Stags"", but then again, a little bit of request with the manager and it got sorted. My team from work arrived at around 7.30 pm and we decided to place our first order, only to realize that the attendants were way too busy to listen to or serve our tables. For each thing we needed, we needed to call out at least 3-4 times. Again, nothing surprising being a Delhite. We're used to being served as the Third World Nation, even after paying roof-racking taxes so what the hell! Attendant / Manager - Lakvir & Rajesh: 1. Ordered Old Monk, the basic Rum, available at a Ghatkopar theka in the country - Guess what, Not Available! :-| 2. Pathetic Dahi ke Kebabs - The most recommended & utterly crappy dish on the Veg menu was the so-called Dahi-ke-Kebabs. The stupidest preparation to a rather mouth-watering dish that I've ever seen at a Delhi based restaurant. 3. Sheesha - Nobody serving the Sheeshas knew how to make one. So had to replace the coal over and over and over again every 10 minutes. Again, not that they were bothered. 4. Ordered the Barbecue Mushroom Pizza - Were served a half cooked, mushroom platter garnished with sugar-syrup. Hello... Did I mention Barbecue?? The next half an hour went in arguing with the nagging restaurant Manager, trying to convince us that we'd never tasted a real Barbecue sauce in our lives since we're from Mars. Finally the guy agreed to replace it with a Plain Margharita Pizza instead; and I quote ""REPLACE"". By the time the evening ended, we'd taken our leave off the place after paying the cheque. To my surprise, when out of the restaurant, I sneaked a peak onto the bill again and realized they'd charged us for both the orders, the Original BBQ Mushroom & the REPLACED Plain Margharita! I'm aghast. Disgusting customer service. Plain cheating in lay-man language. That too when you're charging ridiculously high (upto 25%) taxes (I know your rant about the legal obligations & crap).

Nisha Garg,"Rated A fancy get-in with darkness in good proportions giving you insights 'aaj toh mazaa aane wala hai'. But yes don't fall for it. You won't get a place to sit firstly, and if you are not saved by then(hopefully you do think of going somewhere else) then you will get a seat where the waiters don't even attend you for the first 40 mins! Constant poking and nagging will help you get your food and drinks served at your table! By this time you have already decided to NOT TIP THE WAITERS AND NOT EVEN LEAVE A PENNY EXTRA! Food: Average! Drinks: wahi same! Only the view from the balcony is good, the outer circle traffic and cool breeze, but then why pay for watching a traffic? ~ I ain't going there again! P.S. No pictures because no attractions!",Rated 2.5,36,199,??
Neha Rustagi,"Rated ""The Lord of the Drinks""- as the name suggests, this place has a variety of drinks to offer at a reasonable price. The 2 floor restaurant is huge and has a great ambience and friendly staff. But the place lacks on food. Even though the menu covers a huge range of food choices but the details are small. A pizza with 2 toppings on it cost around 425 bucks which is way pricey than any other place that I have been in CP. Also, the quantity is really small for the prices quoted for food. My friends and I had to leave the place after ordering 4 drinks!",Rated 3.0,8,42,??

Vibhu Gogia,"Rated Had heard a lot about this place. After seeing a lot of check ins I decided to check this place out myself. With whole set of cafes in the area, I wanted to see what different this place had to offer. POSITIVES: As soon as I entered LOD it looked special. The spacious area, large couches, ambient lighting and good music felt good. I had ordered fries with my drinks and the fries were crisp and tasted fresh, a delight to have with drinks. For food I had ordered pizza, pasta, dimsum and mushroom bruschetta and everything was good. NEGATIVES: While the food and place was good, I was extremely disappointed with the service. The service was dead slow as our refills took more than 20 minutes. Also since I arrived early, I asked the LOD executive whether I needed to make a prior booking to which I was told that there was no waiting and I did not require any prior booking. Taking what I was told, I did not make any reservation but was seated at a cramped table which was way too small for 4 people. After raising this issue with the manager, I was assured that I'll be shifted to a different table which never happened. All in all what could have been an excellent experience was turned into an average experience by poor service",Rated 3.0,18,207,??

But didn't know it's NOT ALLOWED !!!!!!!! The person at the desk was damn rude and told us we cannot enter in ""open shoes"". When asked where it's mentioned they had no answer. We revolted but a certain Mohit from their management started abusing and asked us to leave. He misbehaved, abused, spoke in a derrogate manner and asked us to leave.

If you are beer drinker then it is reasonably priced. However the malt and bourbon are pretty expensive. Food is great Nacho Grande is a must have along with pasta. But as the evening progresses the music keeps getting louder and louder which is a put off if you are looking to have conversation.

Vigya Walia,"Rated After I had heard a lot about this place, the interiors, the roof top, the food & the drinks, we finally decided to go invade on a Monday night. We were not sure if there will be enough crowd or will it be boring, but to our surprise the place was almost jam packed around 9.45pm. We initially thought getting seated at the roof top was a better idea given in mind the weather. But then we realised that Mitta percussionist was playing so we decided to take a table on the base level of the place. The place is done up really well. It's big, spacious, sitting capacity is large (really large).To order, the waiter came, they basically had no beer that we wanted, so we went with Hoegaarden (6 beers deal). (Initial choice - Bira, not available... next choice - Kingfisher, not available) and a Red Apple and Litchi Rose Wine Sangria. For sides we ordered - Paneer Tikka, Masala Chilly Cheese fries & Batter Fry Prawns. Comes out the Paneer Tikka came even before the Beers, we had to atleast call for the beers thrice. Finally the drinks came, everything started going good. But the music was seriously beyond my understanding. The place was quite lively for a Monday night. The food is really good.

Alin Choubey,"Rated Visited on a not so happening ""Sunday Night"" In my review hospitality weighs more than any other stuff so lets start with that. It was my solo visit their and I directly visited manager and asked him to provide me a place where I can have some solidarity. He assigned me a great waiter. He not only took me for a brief introductory walk of whole lounge knowing its my first visit but was very generous to go out of the box and gave me a bar chair on the roof top where no one else had one. He also got two bartenders to make sure evening goes through by my will. Then he helped me chose my drinks. I was actually wondering if this was just a Lounge. They actually have very great staff no doubt. The bartenders were very cool. I always go for malts so nothing could go wrong there. After an hour or so I got bored on there and wanted to go down for a couch or something. The bartender, another amazing person took me there and got me my drinks and snack. I ordered french fries and they obviously were pretty good. The waiters down stairs are very young and classy boys. I actually felt very welcomed there. I don't know how this place turns out on weekends but as much as I wanted my solidarity for the night. I got it.",Rated 4.0,24,16,??
Karan Bedi,Rated Simply amazing Is what one can say after visiting this place. The first thing that anyone cannot not notice is the ambiance. The rustic interior compliments the name of the place. Coming to the food I actually don't expect much from places who invest a lot in interiors but The food here is amazing Italian cuisines Pasta arrabiatta It was one of the best pasta I have had in the city. The plain cheese margarita was equally amazing. In whole 5/5 on the food Virgin mojito is a must try Along with White wine In desserts (Though desserts are not mentioned on menu ) Brownie and ice cream can be a good light desserts if you've had enough.

The drinks were great, the ambience (given the theme) is absolutely brilliant. The place is massive, and I really thought it gave each party their own little bubble, which is rare in the city. Furthermore, that patio is just insane. I couldn't believe how big the place is, and with winter rolling around, I can wait to be a regular. I really recommend the place, and I recommend not going by the average aggregate review. Personal opinion, of course.",Rated 4.5,16,68,??
Karan Kumar (@karansayz )( Www.facebook.com/karansayz)(Famed Karanz Review)( Delhi/NCR Top Reviewer),"Rated ** Long back Theres an old saying if you wish for something to happen it will happen. The only caveat being at the right time with the right people and with a good intent . LOD was not just happening . I was planning and every time my calendar kept changing. But , this was it . Stars placed and how. I think this holds true for both me and Priyank Sukhija. Before going to any place for a quick bite or a lavish meal , I love to do my groundwork or homework as we call. This becomes all the more important when you are visiting Priyanks creation as I usually call his joints , all the more. As far as I remember till about 3 years back Priyank was not The Priyank we all know now. He was busy working hard on his ideas , thoughts , USPs travelling and assembling a great array of places that Delhi / NCR would love to dine in and hop in and out in times to come . And rest as they say is history . ** Ambience As you enter this place you will be surprised that this place just does not end . And you can lost easily in the huge arenas this place has to offer . These can be the terrace area seating , the inside seating , private areas , island bar seating and the DJ console area . There are just so many options to pick from. We are talking a little more than 18000 sq. feet area. In my case I was privileged to have Mohit giving me a personalized tour of the entire place , the ideas and thoughts behind the elements being used . He besides being a mixologist is a great person to connect and speak with . This is what I call genuine warmth which can just change your overall experience at any place. We sat outside overlooking the central park and CPs architecture . Open spaces like these are a hard find and I am sure you would love to be here . Only caveat - This also offers folks who are keen to smoke and do a quick sheesha , so the air may not be the best for you. Nevertheless you can always move out and in as per your need . We started by meeting the team at Lord of the Drinks followed by a quick interaction with Chef Surinder Negi. The place has interesting light and creature installations all across. The lighting are dim and the brown leather seating are plush and elegant . And the large red horse. My pictures would say it all. ** Food We went with the Chefs choices - Baby aloo chatpata followed by LOD vegetarian platter and dahi ke kebab and the Mumbai style vada pau , which was simply superb and we ordered it again . Rest of the starters / salads were equally good and filling. ** Drinks Mohit and the team helped with the drinks selections - we started with the LITT , tropical and power stroke which were a little high on the alocohol in terms of palate taste with the orange ( in tropical ) a bit miss . But then LITTs are like that. Cocktails : Ace of swords in love with a chat masala on the rim and red bell pepper inside this was an interesting concoction and a good drink . The warriors favorite was good with a hint of pineapple and star anise. Loved the naming of the drinks in line with the overall theme of Lord of the rings . We wanted to grab a quick bite and had the special dal makhni along with a naan which was yumm . The LOD team recommended the warm chocolate tart base dessert which as always is a killer. ** Music Special mention to DJ MEETA and the gang for playing a music mix which is a rare find in Delhi with active use of live musical instruments . I was dancing on a Monday evening , thanks to them. ** Special Mentions LOD boasts of a microbrewery right on the premises of the bar. Also, its an open air nightclub and has the biggest island bar in Delhi which is typically opened from 3 sides to serve guests . This place was full even on a Monday night and that should say it all. ** Service They serve with a smile . Yes , when you have a place this big and full , good to be a little patient . Everyone is working equally hard . ** More about Priyank Ventures You name the best places in Delhi and 9/10 chances are these would Priyanks ventures. Skooter (at Hotel Samrat), Fork You (at Hauz Khas Village) and Out of The Box (or OTB, at HKV) to name a few. He started very early with Lazeez Affaire's which was and is a runaway success . The best part as I was told by the team is that each of his outlet is with a different concept . And he loves numbers or if I can say square feets : Wearhouse (9,000 sq. ft.) ;Townhouse (9,000 sq. ft.); Lord of the Drinks (18,000 sq. ft.) and Lock, Stock & Barrel (6,000 sq. ft.). Then at the Tolstoy Lane is the plush Hybrid (8,000 sq. ft.) and at the Janpath, there is Lutyens Cocktail House above the Jaguar showroom as a landmark. ** From HKV to Khan and now over to Aerocity and Gurgaon , he is geo-tagging pin-dropping everything . For us. For everyone . ** Trivia Did you know he launched long back at Malcha Marg Market a nightclub : RPM. ** Priyank, where is my Membership Card ?! :) ** Less than3 hoursand already 10,000 plus views on a Tuesday afternoon.

Neha Batra,"Rated Another huge place that has recently opened by Mr Priyank Sukhija is lavish. The ambience is great. We picked up this place for drinks and sheesha on a Wednesday eve. When you will enter you would be amazed to see as how nicely it's done . But what amazed me was the terrace , loved it ;) you could see the whole of CP. in food we ordered penne chicken pasta in red sauce and spicy chicken Dimsums. The food was average . Since the place is called Lord of the drinks so I wasn't much expecting from the good, we ordered kiwi pan sheesha which was good too , very refreshing .

Ankita,"Rated Connaught Place has finally found its pants. And is flaunting them rather well I say. Not long ago this beautiful area had lost its charm because of the construction, we now see plethora of restaurants mushrooming in the area. One of them is Lord of the Drinks. A few days back I was here and absolutely enjoyed my meal. But before all that lets talk decor. Fun elements are thrown here and there making this place stand out. I'm sure tons of selfies will be live soon, cementing my observation. Anyway we started with alcohol, and I got myself a Lord's Martini. It was heady, fruity and minty- combinations I like. Later on I tried the Mango Mania. Interesting taste, and worth a try. I say go all out and experiment with their cocktails, even though the ingredients read funky and overwhelming. They are loaded with alcohol (no cheating) and flavor. The Keema Pao was one of the starters ordered and was an instant hit. Who would have thought you would enjoy it with a cocktail, but you do. Maybe it's the spice, or the buttery soft buns or the zing. Whatever it was all I can say is there's something very comforting about this dish. The Prawn Chermoula had a lovely bite to them, the sauce was spot on. Yum, yum. We also tried the Drums of Heaven which were juicy, saucy and everything else one could expect it to be. For mains, we wanted to keep it light and simple. So the chef (who by the way was coming to all table asking for opinions) suggested us roti and dal, with a hot green garlic sauce and chilli garlic noodles. So delicious the dal was. Simple, lightly spiced, and brilliant after a crazy drinking spree. The noodles were not oily, had tons of garlic and went well with the sauce. Lastly we opted for the Chocolate Walnut Tart which was nice, no complains. The shortbread biscuit though was extremely crumbly. I am bookmarking this place for all celebrations on my list because the food is light & tasty and the service is upto mark. The guys attending us were swift and the whole price range is decent. With that the music is nice and the space is ample. letstalkfood.in",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The ambience and the crowd is good, I liked the dull lighting theme and the interiors definitely deserve a mention. The music they play is quite generic and you will have no problems humming the songs after you have gulped a drink or two. The couches and the chairs are quite comfortable and I won't blame you if you want to spend some more time. The drinks and the food menu is loaded with options and the former won't even pinch your wallet. The latter however didn't quite impressed me and I may even say it is a bit on the costlier side.

Bar has been structured nicely. Food quality is top notch (had pasta really liked it). Music is good and the staff (except one manager) is very friendly and helpful. So one week after the place has opened up, I decide to visit it on a Sunday. First biggest turn off is, empty tables inside and still there's a waiting of an hour. I ask around and I come to know that tables have been RESERVED ON A WEEKEND. Seriously are you guys kidding me? Taking reservations on a weekend? Anyway I decide to talk to a sardarji manager there. I think that was my biggest mistake as it completely ruined my experience of this place. One of the rudest managers that I've ever seen.

Be it drinks, ambiance or musical performances, no one does it better than LOTD, especially at the given price. However, if you expect a lot from food, it would be wise to double check the name - Lord of the DRINKS (and not food :p). The food is decent while the drinks are Amazing! Not to forget - they are being offered at a startling price. With different seating options to complement the grandeur of the facade, LOTD is subdivided into sub sections including an area close to the band, a calm and warm setting for peace lovers, a bar area, rooftop and a smoker's zone. FOOD: For the little prices they offer, we ordered quite a lot without thinking twice. My favorites among them were roti te boti, keema pao, jumbo prawns and red sauce spaghetti. Each of them were brilliantly cooked and infused with tempting flavors, though the quantity was consistently less. Two drinks that appealed me were - ace of swords and sangria. Strawberry margarita was okay, nothing remarkable. Fire shots were impressive. For desserts, we tried their red velvet, cheese cake and brownie. Every bit was delectable. Insanely rich! Loved them. For those who enjoy partying over drinks and finger food, love music and yet doesn't want to shell a fortune. GIVE LOTD A TRY and thanks me later! yummydelhi.wordpress.com",Rated 4.5,80,3911,??

Vineet Jain,"Rated The place I had chosen for my 25th birthday, and I was not disappointed. Well, it could have been better but still the place is new in the town and many things go in their favour. The first thing is their ambiance and look. It was majestic. The second thing is their terrace. Gosh! I wish we had went there instead of seating on the 1 floor. But never mind, winters are coming and so is our 2nd outing at the place. Then comes the food. The food was awesome. Specially, Dahi ke kabab, the best I have tasted yet in Delhi, and Pizza. The Non veg noodles and other dishes were also good according to my friends. However, only Paneer Tikka was not good. My friends who went there on my recommendation also pointed out the same about chilli paneer. Now come the things that need some looking into. Firstly, their Service. It was a Thursday, not even a public holiday. But still, the service was slow. We had to order some dishes twice or thrice due to the time they were taking. Secondly, their smoking zone. We were seating next to the door which leads to terrace, and the smoke was irritating my friends which were seating closer to the door. So, please take care of this things. One suggestion: You have a good DJ and some space in front of it. If you can allow a lil bit of dancing at nyt, the place would become a hard to miss on any list.:)",Rated 3.5,51,210,??
Sumit Sawhney,"Rated One of those places where you should not go only looking at the ambience and size of the place. This is of the new places in town so thought to try out last night. I am very much disappointed with the service / quality of food and availability of beers. Out of 10 beers listed they had only a few available. Plus only one draught available , no Bira no fosters nothing was available. Why do you even list them when you cant provide. Food : I ordered a Veg Platter ( rs.775 plus plus ) - Once you look at the platter you will see how dissspointing it is. Leave aside the minimalistic quantity that they serve, the quality is so bad. It clearly looked as is he just warmed the kebabs up in microwave and served. The fried potatoes ( yes fried potatoes served in kebab platter ) were called tandoori aalo. Had ordered sweet corn soup as well but again not even served hot. I have figured out that these big places in Cp are only looking for bigger parties where people wouldn't thin about the food and just keep ordering drinks. The servers think they are much cooler in lying to you about what is being served on the table. And now i have started to hate the places where you just bring down the booze prices a little but rob the customer for bad quality food and this i found was one of those. Would never recommend this if younare looking for some good food.",Rated 1.0,50,185,??

There were so many waiters and the place was quite empty but still they did not bother to serve us. The manager was polite though. Sheesha: We ordered 'THE SORCERER'S STONED' which sounded very promising and good, its flavour was amazing but the smoke was less. They dod not prepare it well. Even after changing the coil they could not fix the problem. Food&Drinks: The food was tasty. The pizza(cottage cheese peri peri) was very delicious and worth the money but the dimsum was way too expensive as they served very less quantity. We did not try mocktails.

And we were not at all disappointed On entering the place, one would be surprised by its vastness. The entire space has been used properly. As the name suggests, its LOTR themed with armours and helmets from mediaeval ages. Sitting has been done beautifully. Thumbs up for the bar. You have a number of sitting options ranging from Indoor to terrace seating. Plus good music collection. Being a Monday noon, crowd was minimal, so we decided to sit in front of the bar (nothing special but u get view of entire booze collection). We started with cocktails along with Cottage Cheese Peri Peri Pizza - good portions and taste. This was followed by Ratatouille Lasagne, which was also prepared well. After having another round of cocktails, we ended our visit with Cheese Cake which could have a been a bit more soft.

Vasudha Tingal,"Rated Went here last evening with a group of friends. Funnily, the guy standing at the entrance informed us that chappals/floaters weren't allowed in their restaurant and some of us were wearing them. We requested him a couple of times and he agreed in the end. This is probably the first cafe/bar where I've heard of such a rule and usually high end restaurants and membership clubs only have such rules. Since these places are usually visited by students/youngsters I think they should do away with such rules. So anyway, we went inside and were quite impressed with the ambiance. The lighting was great and music was upbeat. We were 8-9 of us so we sat right in the centre on the huge sofas which were pretty comfortable. Strangely, they hardly had any pitchers of beer available and no towers as well which was pretty disappointing. Since this place is primarily a drinking place, I guess they should stock up well before the weekend at least. We ordered buckets of beer and also tried bira, a cheap flavoured beer they had on the menu which was more like a breezer. We ordered some finger food like nachos, chilli cheese fries and chilly paneer all of which was good. The bill came around 5k which is decent enough. It's a nice addition to the infinite number of cafes and bars which are opening up in cp and definitely a fun place to hangout with a group of friends.",Rated 3.5,35,318,??

I was only here for a chit chat over beer n snacks. I'll only talk about the pricing and snacks since beer is anyway beer. The beer pitcher prices are quite reasonable and even the cocktails are priced reasonably but the starters and food is where they have little upped the digits. I liked their chicken schezuan. The quantity was good. Nothing to go gaga about the taste but good. They play nice music. The staff is friendly. I had heard about their terrace area but couldn't try that.

Rachita Tiwari,"Rated So,after hearing a lot of hoopla about this newly opened Resto-bar/lounge,we went to this place on a Saturday evening at around 6:30 with a aim to laze around till late hours. What we encountered was a very ""been there done that"" kind of an ambience say like that of the townhouse,the vault,the warehouse which are in the same vicinity. The place was moderately crowded therefore we could easily find a place for two and thus began the phase of utter disappointment. While we were really quick in deciding what we wanted to have,we had to wait for the waiter for almost 15 mins despite letting the manager know that we were ready to order.Since, we were famished,it spoilt our mood even before tasting the food. Our order comprised of strawberry mojito, pint of beer, chicken inventino and veg quesadillas. The chicken was a starter, cold,"" and had five pieces with olive inside.It was just enough to satiate our palette but wasn't filling at all.veg quesadillas,had four pieces with two kinds of dips.What I really hated about this was that it just tasted like ""aloo shimlamirch rolled in a roti"" ! I had not come out to have something which I eat at home.it was a major disappointment and spoilt my mood for the rest of the evening. A plan of staying out till late changed due to bad mood caused by not so yummy food. To conclude :- My experience might be one off,but the ambience and the food won't win you over at this place.

Lord has more things going for it like, good music, dim ambience, which I prefer if given a choice, good menu, both for drinks and food and enough space, so you don't feel cramped which majority of places in this category lack. One of the drawback I thought, was the service, where the waiter said, the place doesn't serve omelettes after noon and the menu clearly mentions all day breakfast. Also, the servers don't know their menu in and out and there is a mismatch between order given and the kitchen. We had salad, omelette and a pitcher of bira beer.

Everyone is very friendly. I went there first time, it was a great experience. I was sitting at the bar and it got pretty crowded that night. A huge bar, pool tables and friendly bartenders make this place a good spot to throw back a few drinks. As mentioned, the crowd is mixed, and that's a good thing! Everyone was enjoying themselves and at no point did we feel unwelcome, as can happen when there's a large contingent of regulars at a bar. Drinks are decently strong and they have a good selection of beers and hard alcohol. Prices are pretty cheap.

We decided to give it a try. Without further ado, we bolted down to this place. And as soon as we entered, we knew it wasnt a bad decision. This place is a like a huge setup of one of those castles from Game Of Thrones. The ambiance was a little dramatic but it was very unique and this is what makes this place different from the rest of restaurants at CP. As the name suggests, this place has taken its inspiration from the Lord of the Rings trilogy and hence, LORD OF THE DRINKS! If the first floor is creatively designed keeping in mind the smart usage of collectors swords and lots of body suits and armors, the next floor which is the terrace part is like a dream. Open bar, super amazing view and great ambiance will keep you in awe throughout your stay. Moving on to food, its nothing less than perfect.

Vandita_Roaming Gastronaut,"Rated Mr. Priyank Sukhijas latest venture has been up and running in Connaught Place since last month. We have all come to expect interesting concept and/or magnanimous ambiance from him. Lord of the Drinks does not disappoint in the grandeur. It is a huge setup with more than ample seating and the ambiance is a little different this time. As the name and its text styling suggests, inspiration has been taken from the Lord of the Rings trilogy and hence, youll find collectors swords on display and a lot of armored bodysuits on display. The foot of the staircase that leads to the terrace area, has a big red horse sculpture installed. I would have preferred to see a white horse there. I would have happily assumed it to be Gandalfs! :D But thats just my fixation. I am a huge fan of the LOTR and the Hobbit series and it was the primary reason why I had been looking forward to this restaurant, ever since I got to know about this project. I was expecting posters of the main characters in the restaurant or depictions of the middle-earth and a lot of LOTR references in the menu. Its not the case though! True to its name, Lord of the Drinks (LOTD) has a very impressive and huge bar and their drinks menu is endless. I tried their cocktail Ace of Swords in Love. I do not remember the last time I had a cocktail, as I usually dont venture beyond wine, but I would still like to believe that this cocktail was one of the very unique concoctions out there. It had tequila, red bell peppers, coriander, orange juice and spices. The ingredients were unbelievable and I couldnt fight my curiosity and took a few sips of my friends drink. Like I said, it was indeed very unique in taste. I could never imagine bell peppers playing a role in any cocktail. Also, the rim of the glass had chaat masala on it instead of salt. Lip smacking! I also had a red wine sangria and I have to say that there seemed to be too many pieces of apple than wine in it. Although the wine was a good one, the quantity was overshadowed by the fruit. We started off with Chicken Crostini and Mumbai Vada Sliders. Two very different appetizers. One was Italian and the other Mumbaiyaa. A crostini is very similar to a bruschetta,, but unlike a bruschetta its not rubbed with garlic neither topped with olive oil, besides the toppings. The crostini is small pieces of toasted bread with a topping on it. The Chicken Crostini was absolutely delicious. The bread was perfectly crisp and the minced chicken and cream topping was to die for. Topped with a sliced black olive and herb, it was perfection! The vada pavs too met the expectations. The bun was soft and patty almost melted in each bite and was spicy. They were served with green chutney and onion. For main course, we had Bologna penne pasta. It was after a long time that I was having lamb bolognaise pasta. The minced meat sauce was very balanced in flavor and the pasta was well cooked. But I would have preferred it to be served piping hot as this pasta tends to get cold quickly and then becomes lumpy. I did like the food at LOTD but I have to say that I would have enjoyed it more had the serving time been short. A lot of work needs to go into the service. Although I see that the Manager and GM is an experienced lot, but the servers came across as very inexperienced, hence affecting the execution of service. They seem frantic and confused. Hopefully, this is one of the teething problems that a restaurant faces and will be sorted out with time! roaminggastronaut.wordpress.com",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Half Thalli Full,"Rated My drinking buddy and I decided to try out LOD yesterday, and came back wishing we had stuck to our regular bar. The major differentiating factor as far as bars go, and where LOD failed, are service, music, vibe of the place etc. As most good bars stand on an equal footing as far as the actual alcohol goes. LOD is located conveniently in the outer circle and is pretty easy to find. The stairs leading up to the place are lit in red and use chains instead of a railing, giving the whole place a dungeon-esqu feel. The actual decor of the place looks much better, with fancy light, lots of wood and nice comfortable seating. The place is adorned with replica body armour and helmets of knights. LOD has a massive and great terrace, which overlooks CP and given the right weather, this is where you should sit. The service was a mixed bag. Half of the staff refused to tend to u as they only deal with shisha. It took us a while to get a hold of a willing server, who had to be requested for menus and water. Thereafter the service was better and fast. There was live and recorded music playing together which messed it up. Worse was when the guy doing the live thing was doing his sound check while recorded music was playing. In the couple of hours that we were there, electricity went twice and it was a blackout. All these contributed to a disappointing experience. The drinks and food were decent. We had beer and tropical LIIT, which was strong but not as fruity as expected. We also had kung pao paneer an chilli chicken. The paneer had a tofu like texture and tasted almost like chilli paneer with peanuts. Chilli chicken was good. Overall our experience at LOD was pretty disappointing. They have a massive and beautiful set up, whish they would iron out their issues.",Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Sachin Sahni,"Rated As the name says, ""LORD OF THE DRINKS"" as soon as one hear about this place one has a very high expectations with the place when it comes to The drinks. (Mainly Alcohol/Cocktails) up till now in CP (Cannaught Place) there was only one place where one could've fount the cheapest booze option and that was My Bar. This outlet is a very stringent reply to them as per my understanding as this place is more bigger, with a very great ambiance and great food options. How to reach? The best and the easiest way to reach Lord of the Drinks is to take a metro towards Rajiv Chowk Metro Station and exit towards gate number 1 and it's just only 700 mts away from the station that you won't even feel that it's a long distance. Food & Drinks : I went there and had a very few dishes out of their very wide range of the menu. To be very straight forward I was damn confused for the first time as this was Mr. Priyank Sukhija venture and all of the restaurant of his has a very awesome food varieties with an awesome taste. But, I could not hold myself back and straight away ordered some of their famous cocktails from their selected menu. I had; Ace Of Swards In Love (Cocktail) : Which is a very awesome tasting and a unique blend of taquila, Red bell pepper, coriander, orange & spices that I was really able to taste it. It was really awesome and for me if I've to rate the alcohol content out of 10 it will be 8 I think as it was strong cocktail and at the same time it was delicious. I also Had My Passion (Cocktail) : Which has a very unique taste of its own and had a very flavourful and beautiful punch of Vodka, Passion Fruit, Pineapple juice & Star Anise. This was for the very first time that I had Star Anise in a cocktail. Which was quite innovative and the alcohol content would be 8.5. As was already down two drinks so, for the love of food I decided to have a hog on food menu and started ordering food. Almost everything was really great to have there was not even a single flaw that I could take a fault on weather if it is a mutton dish, Chicken, fish or prawns. Everything was cooked to perfection and some of the must try dishes that on must have like Mahi Fish tikka, Malai tikka, keema Pav, Roti & Boti are some of the beautiful dishes that one must watch out for. But a dish that really took away my heart was Roti & Boti which was actually a small shapped mutton tikkas made with very tangy flavours that I really wanted to call it like a Khatta meat's different version which is served with complimentary parantha. The best time to have it would be right after its on your table. As I was already full after that and really had no space so I directly dig into the desserts and I had pancakes and a Cheesecake tart which was a premium delight. To be very true I had not realised that I shall be very happy with The Lord's every aspect. And it is really very true I wish I could have given it a full 5.0 out if 5.0 Stars but the only concern that I had was the staff was a bit lagging behind in the order because of which there was few moments where I've to sit ideal but I would say that's still okay and almost negligible as the same day j was listening to and most very awesome LIVE GIG performances which made me hold on and I could not complain at all. My Final Verdict The final verdict shall be a very nice place and a really looking forward to spend my special evening at LORD OF THE DRINKS only. The final thing that I would like to mention is that as a name would suggest LORD OF THE DRINKS one may not expect the food to be very good but this was something exceptional and the food was finger licking which is quite unusual. So my final rating would be 4.5 Stars out of 5 Stars. And a definite a must visit list in Delhi/NCR. foodietreasure.blogspot.com",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Prateek Gupta,"Rated This place is a must visit! With newer outlets coming up at every corner of delhi.. This one is sure to stay; and in style. The place is huge.. With 2 levels of seating. We sat at the roof... Which is also beautifully done. And even though it was a summer night; the mist fans did a good job to keep sweating at bay. For me, it was a touch better than downstairs, coz the music was not that loud.. And you don't have to shout to talk. Service is as good at it gets. We ordered some veg snacks and all were very well done: the pizza, cheese fingers and the schezwan paneer. We left the premises at around 12, and we were the only ones leaving. It was packed even that late.. On a Friday night. All in all, a good place to hang out. Nice food, lovely music. Next time maybe we will order some drinks to find out exactly if it is the LORD OF THE DRINKS :-)",Rated 4.5,5,22,??
Nidhi Paliwal | Www.spiceandstyle.com,"Rated LOCATION - Cannaught Place PRICE- Rs.1500 for two people Latest venture by Mr.Priyank Sukhija is out and how! With his other 6 outlets already running successfully in the same area ,this outlet is surely a notch higher. Priyank sukhija famous for his projects having larger than life ambience, did not disappoint this time as well. The restaurant spans over 2 floors having a large open terrace area. Definitely one of the biggest open terrace area so far in Cannaught place! Can not wait for the winters to come soon so that I can enjoy the CP view from this terrace! *lovestruck* Once you enter this restaurant, it will definitely leave you mesmerized! The armours, shields, swords and warrior gears were beautifully placed around the whole place reminding us of the medieval times. This place depicts class and power. The restaurant is spacious and I love how the seating area has been arranged. The name 'LORD OF THE DRINKS' itself suggests what to expect from this place. With a huge bar placed in the centre, this place has an amazing collection of liquor and serves a large variety of cocktails and mocktails. Every restaurant opens up with a planned statergy and targets specific type of customers. Well, this place targets everyone who hates sitting at home on a Saturday night and for everyone who loves to party it out on a monday night too! :P Also for people who don't hesitate to try that strong LIIT on a hot sunny afternoon , in short for everybody who wants to commit the sin of surrendering to the LORD OF THE DRINKS! ( PUN INTENDED) ;) FOOD TALK- CRISPY PEPPER PANEER- Crispy paneer with exotic crispy vegetables! It wasn't oily but was a tad bit day for me. The flavours were good though. MUSHROOM AND WATER CHESTNUT DIMSUMS tasted delicious with authentic flavours and that perfectly cooked outer layer of dimsums. Next in line were my all time favorite MOZZERELLA STICKS.They were perfect crispy and I almost finished all of them alone! It tasted amazing with the cheesy dip. Like I always say ' there is no such thing as too much cheese' ! Then came the 4 cheese pizza. The pizza tasted good and the base was perfectly cooked. Only suggestion if you are putting sour cream on top ( which I personally love) then better put a bit of it evenly on every slice. That would be easier to eat and visually appealing too! :P Next on the table was DAHI KE KEBAB. Made of hung curd with spices,it's crisp from outside and super soft from inside. My favorite Indian starter! Was prepared well but too much ginger spoiled it a bit though. Some people might like it actually. But I have never been a ginger lover! After that came the KEEMA PAO. It was really good. All the non vegetarians must try it!! DRINK TALK- I tried a variety of LIIT's. They have so many options out of which I tried the CLASSIC, TROPICAL and KHATTA MEETHA . Loved the tropical LIIT which had orange and pineapple. Others were good too. Can not wait to try the rest on the menu!! My favorite drink from the evening had to be the refreshing CUCUMBER AND LIME MARGARITA. Loved it! So overall this place offers global cuisine. The finger foods are yummy and the cocktails delicious. Perfect place to binge on those bar snacks and get happy over the sinful drinks! P.S- Service really needs to improve! Hopefully next time I visit I get better service. Would I ever visit again? Well yes, but only if the staff promises not to ignore me again ;)",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Disha Sahasrabudhe,"Rated Spoiler alert! Awful service, the waiters love delegating their work to other fellows. Slow, rather sloth slow service, we waited for 45 minutes just to receive sheesha, which wasn't value for money, must mention! Food average, ambience is a 4+ however the service sucks big time, the staff seems least bothered to attend the customers. Portion size... Is good enough for a 12 year old. Had huge expectations, a major let down by the management. Went in for my friends birthday, poor girl, her birthday was ruined to core, due to the sluggish service. Recommending this place to people interested in only drinking or clicking pictures, as the ambience is impressive. Dear management, we want our food served on time, with exactly what ordered, not what you thought we did, and when we come up to you with our grievances we expect solution, not your shallow apology.

Kunal Singh Sodhi,"Rated A great place in CP and its HUGE, spread across two floors,this place does impress you with their Ambiance and decor. Went on a Saturday night and wasn't surprised to find it crowded and had to wait to get a table. Took the seating on the terrace side. A lovely view overlooking CP. Was very difficult to get a table, but the manager was helpful. So far so good. But the experience was only great till there. Food wasn't upto the mark, and service was really really slow. Most items we got were cold and not as good as we expected them to be. Had to request 3-4 times to find the status of the order and drinks. And at one point of time had to ask the waiter if he was angry with us because there was just no response from him or his team. I do recommend this place only on the basis of its ambiance and the feel of the place. Don't have high hopes on the food or for the service.",Rated 3.0,38,125,??
Vishesh Monga,"Rated My search for a place in CP with big space and decent pricing landed me to Lord of the drinks. As soon as I entered the medivial style thematic ambience appealed to me. The restaurant was filled to quater capacity which suited us perfectly. Their service was disappointing. Thrice the waiter had to be told to set a hookah and once a wrong order was brought. Here goes the food analysis : Chilly Paneer- It was okayish, a little sour and the quality of paneer was not so good. Penne Alfredo- Worst of the items we ordered, it was undercooked and the penne was not boiled properly. Olive Chicken Tikka- This dish came with an excellent presentation and great taste too. It was juicy, tender and full of olive flavour. Sichuan Fried Chicken wings- Excellent dish again, with burnt ginger flavour and a touch of spice. Keema Pav- The Best dish we had certainly. Keema was well flavoured and cooked making us craving for more.... Bottomline is the their non-veg selection is better than veg and service needs improvement.",Rated 3.5,58,760,??
Bhumika Gupta,"Rated NOT EVEN THE PEASANT OF DRINKS The only reason i choose to go to this place for my birthday was because i wanted to go someplace 1. New and trending- Check 2. Has a good ambience and crowd- Check 3. But most ""IMP"" make the night a success by serving us some real booze! But to my utter disappointment the night was as flat as the drinks served! If you are a beer person or a whiskey with soda/water lover you can go to the place because it demands no creativity. But if you want a generic alcoholic mixed drink then get ready to be cheated. The drinks have funny taste and negligible alcoholic content. The classic LIIT tastes like POPPINS, the mojitos like kfcs virgin mojito and every other cocktail on the menu made me burst into laughter. FOOD: the food is below average. Lollipops were raw. Chilly chicken ok. Pizza fine nothing great. Nonveg platter bland. Prawns again ok. Staff: out of the three men dealing around our table. First new and clueless about the menu. Second constantly telling us dnt do this, dnt sit here, please move to another table we are about to have a party here after 3.5 hours of us sitting there. Third and the only sweet guy who actually let us click pictures with the armours at his risk. In all i paid a huge amount and got nothing but disappointment. NOT RECOMMENDED.",Rated 1.5,5,60,??

The food we ordered came just about the right time, though the drinks came superfast. The food pricing is done up very decently, the food is also very good as almost everything we ordered on the table was deliciously yummy.

In drinks we ordered bira jug ( nothing can go wrong with that) and a red wine sangria pitcher which tasted rotten !!

Abhinav Rohatgi,"Rated LOD is one of the newest and one of the best looking bars out there in CP. Situated in the epicenter of the city close to the Starbucks outlet, the bar is pretty easy on the eyes. The narrow flight of stairs open up to the dimly lit and a very classy looking sitting area which uses hues of red and golden to much effect. There is an equally impressive terrace section split into two parts. The highlight is the unobstructed view from the terrace as well as the way one section opens up to the other. Quite impressive actually. The visual appeal is sadly not backed up by excellent food. True to it's name, the drinks are extremely good and they even have regular cocktails with their own special twist. Cherry on top is the pricing of the drinks, which is pretty good considering the ambience and the entire setup. My problem lies with the food. To elaborate, we ordered the masala fries (loaded) and a medium done tenderloin steak. The presentation of the dish was top notch but beneath the glossy looking meal was meat which was cold. Upon inquiring, the server insisted that it was warm but since I had to use the washroom for maybe a minute it got cold. Meh, seemed like an excuse but I let it pass and asked the gentleman to reheat it. To my surprise, it took them 15 mins to reheat the dish and it came back exactly the same. Cold like an uncooked chewy piece of meat. I was so disappointed that I did not even ask them for a possible explanation. It was more rare done than medium (it would have been ok if I'd asked for a rare done steak because it is usually soft and cold, but I did not ). We decided to carry on and enjoy the evening and not let one dish spoil our mood. Moral of the story: Great place to go for drinks and nibbles but horrendous if you're going there was a meal. I wish I could rate this place higher but the food was quite a bummer. 3.0/5.0 for this one. Happy hogging.",Rated 3.0,41,81,??
Kats,"Rated Dim lights, nice music, good food and drinks what else is needed for good times. This place has done justice to its name it is the "" Lord of the Drinks"". As u enter this place u ll get the medieval feel, at the entrance two knight armour will welcome u. The decore the lighting gives u the feeling of relax and enjoy. Now the food and drinks : We ordered a number of cocktails some were, Mango Mania, Sword of Ace in Love(something like that) a must must try, My Passion (I really loved this one), LIIT etc. Each and every drink served was amazing, full marks for the drinks. Now coming to food, which was equally wonderful: Bacon fries : Crispy loaded with bacon was good. Caesar Salad : Best that I had till now, so fresh and chicken was generously added. Must try. Chicken and fish tikka : Ohh! Melt in the mouth experience. Both were equally amazing. A recommendation for both. Mix Platter : A mix of veg and nonveg items which included mutton seekh a perfect one, so tender and flavorful paneer tikka, melt in the mouth chicken tikka and few more good things. Loved it Chicken Dragon Rolls : Crispy flavor intact chicken rolls with a sauce topped over. The sauce complimented the already fine rolls. A must try. Spare Ribs : Tender and full of flavors. That's it. Must dig in for the WOW in it. Three little piggy pizza : Was good for pork lovers but I felt a bit low on flavours. Kheema Pao : Butter soaked soft pao with delicious kheema. Balanced spices gave it a amazing flavor which lingers in the mouth for a long time. Recommended. Rotti aur Botti : Soft mutton with rotti is a love for indian meat lovers and here u won't be disappointed. Fish and Chips : Fine soft flaky fish with crunchy chips and tartar sauce. Superbly done. Sweet Endings with Pan Cake with chocolate and salted caramel. Though pan cakes were nice but I loved the salted caramel a lot. Salted Caramel is a must have. Overall an excellent experience.

Bharat Sharma,"Rated Great lounge with a lot of space, friendly staff, and good drinks. Upon walking in, you can already hear the music. It can be a little loud so come with close friends if you don't mind your personal space being invaded to hear each other over the music. The crowd was pretty mixed and mellow. Even with such loud music (there was a DJ that night), definitely no dancing. If you're looking for a mix of techies, hipsters, and techie hipsters, then this is the place to go. The atmosphere is dark and trendy, complete with brick walls and hardwood floors. The music is loud enough to drown out any awkward silences, and the lighting is dark enough to significantly improve your physical appearance. If you're coming here with a large party, you should book out a lounge. The lounge makes things much better. It's very comfortable and spacious. The space is fairly loud, but it's nice and has a good atmosphere. In food, we ordered Chermoula Vegetables, Baby Aloo Chatpata, a tasty chaat made of baby potatoes with chaat masala and sweet creamy curd, Arancini Balls, went really well with the sauce, Dahi ke Kebab were so soft that they were melting in my mouth without making any effort, Veg Dim sums were going really well with the chili sauce and the last food item was Bbq Mushroom Pizza, It was so so. In desserts, we ordered Blueberry cheesecake and chocolate tart. Both were good in taste but I like most Chocolate Tart, I was loaded with chocolate sauce as well. Servers are friendly and actually fairly fast for it being so crowded. Overall the drinks were very good (with some duds but only a few!) I had a lot of other drinks, and they are all good except for one which I don't remember. Oh well. Great bar to hang out with friends. Enjoy! I will visit it soon.

But i would suggest to sit in the lounge as it may have better service. Music is decent as well. But the only concern is non availability of drinks which are most common, despite the name ""Lord of the Drinks"". Food is also decent. And finally it comes down to service. If you are on terrace u will have to wait for 5 mins to locate the person serving you because there are many stewards but none will listen except the one who is serving you.

It is a very spacious, dimly lit place with a rustic and ethnic feel to it. Seating is comfortable in the form of large sofas. The food and cocktails they have to offer is excellent. We tried a wide range of non veg as well as veg dishes, none of which disappointed. We tried the Keema Pav, Dahi Kebab, veg platter, non veg platter, bacon and pork fries, spaghetti primeverra, eglioli, boti aur Roti, sausages in veggies, veg dimsums and chef's special prawns. All had a distinct and lasting taste. The food will make you miss it and come back for more. If you go, definitely try the roti and boti, keema pav and the prawns. In the drinks department we ordered the Red and white sangria's, Cosmopolitan, Classic LIIT, Rouge LIIT, Berry Cosmo, Classic Cosmo, Classic Martini, bira on tap and the blush shots. Apart from the rouge liit, all the other cocktails were top notch. Perfectly blended and crafted. To add to all this extravagance, there were two solo artists performing live, crooning to the best of both English and Hindi tracks, which set the tempo of the visit and really made it one memorable experience. A special mention to rupin and Pooja. Please let them keep coming and spreading magic with their music lotd.

Lot of options in food also starting from Indian to Continental to Chinese to Italian. And taste was also not bad. But I guess USP of this place is, of course, drinks.",Rated 3.5,44,87,??
Sonam Bajaj,"Rated Worst and pathetic food .. Everything just tasted yuck . Ordered dimsums which were totally pale .. Tandoori platter had veggies which tasted like ghobhi ki sabji and utter hard paneer tikkas .: Pizza and stir fry equally bad and COLD Yucck .. Last we order nachos hoping that they don't have to do much in making them . Instead of cheese they put cream in it , which was salt less and probably wasn't even mayonnaise : hated it too .. Sangria was too sweet , wasn't done well . A simple Ice tea wasn't perfect either . Had to send again for sweet syrup . Only nice thing was its ambience . Place decor is done very well . Bad cutlery and crockery again , not expected from this group chain to keep such cheap one ..",Rated 1.0,34,83,??
Amit Chauhan,"Rated Alright so writing about the current BIG THING of Connaught Place - Lord of the Drinks.As the name suggests this place offers a good collection of drinks, cocktails and an experience of probably best weekend hangout places in town. I have visited this place 3 times till date which I would further bifurcate below - - Launch Party : Offered wide varieties of good food & drink options and service was 'undoubtedly' very smooth. I rate this experience 10/10. - Other Visits : Offered very average food and services is 'undoubtedly' pathetic. Survived on drinks and snack options both the times. I rate these experiences 3/10. Above I have specifically used the word 'undoubtedly' in both the points to highlight how the experiences fluctuated from partying among the who's of who of the Delhi's party circle @ launch party to normal day visits with your friends. I'm sure readers would understand my point here ;) Finally speaking about the positives, the staff greets and settles you very warmly (...and that's all). Separately, this place offers some really good & cheap cocktail options worth trying and an experience to enjoy your drinks with friends over good music. Ohh btw Keema Pao is good :D Finally I really want to rate this place low but I'm impressed with the 'Bar' in specific and the 'hype' this place has managed to generate among people.",Rated 3.5,30,631,??
AnKit Sharma,"Rated Lord Of the Drinks, newest addition in the heart of the city and probably one of the biggest party place of the city. Ambience is very classy with a bar opened from two sides. They also have a huge terrace with a beautiful view to take your heart away. From Knights to Horses decor is highly inspired from my favorite movie Lord of the rings. This visit was the Hmm's 2 year celebration party. We had peri peri chicken , nachos , drums of heaven , butter chicken and naan. Food wasn't that good but peri peri chicken is worth trying. Since this the party place one thing which didn't disappoint was cocktails tried red and white sangria (Red one was better) and Adam's LIIT. Over all we had a great time. I would love to visit again. One more plus point they have a valet parking too. :D",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The Food was bad ->under cooked noodles. ->The worst mozzarella rolls i've ever had. -> BBQ mushroom pizza was the worst of the lot ,having some kind of a very pungent smell. We ordered mojito for drinks,may be that was the only thing that calmed us down.

As the name suggests, we were hoping to find a wide range of drinks but unfortunately, they hardly had anything available, that we ordered.

Deepti Kumra,"Rated Lord of the Drinks! No introduction needed.. The name itself is enough for us to guess that it is one stop for all your parties! Lord of the drinks in the outer circle in CP is a relatively new addition and has definitely made a name for itself. It is primarily famous for its huge terrace which gives a spectacular view indeed! Since even I went for a party there, the whole ambiance and interiors were just perfect to get that party mood going. I loved their choice of music. The food was amazing and the bartender was extremely fast catering to all our needs and the drinks were ofcourse superb! I had a lot of dishes but can recall very few and here goes my review for those dishes.. Peri Peri Chicken (4.5/5): The chicken was spicy, hot and served fresh! Garlic Chicken (4/5): The flavor of garlic was extremely enthusing and made me want to have more and more and more. Chicken Crostini and Mushroom Crostini (3.5/5): I am not a big fan of cold dishes but still it managed to satiate my taste buds. Veg Pizza (4/5): The mini veg pizzas were very delicious and not heavy at all, leaving room for other yummy items as well. Drinks: Their mocktails and cocktails were amazing and made with a perfect balance of flavors. The drink which stood out was their White Sangria. Surely a must try! I would surely recommend this place if you are looking for a little private place for a party and want to have a blast or just chill out with your friends on the terrace.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Ankur Bora,"Rated Lord Of The Drinks - Connaught Place New Delhi. A huge place, I dint imagine that it could accommodate so many people. It also has a lovely terrace. Considering its size the dance floor was surely small but the idea is too dance where ever you are. Played EDM as that's the most popular now a days. The decor was nice grungy some where reminded me of Social offline. The LIIT was a disappointment and so were the shots. We had to tell the waiter to get us better drinks. That's the problem most party places in Delhi, they faulter when their are too many people. The food was okay nothing great but wouldn't complain either.

The garlic bread that came along with pasta was yum. QUANTITY AND VALUE FOR MONEY Quenchers are dirt cheap in the vicinity. Food is a bit expensive and quantity doesn't compliment the price.

Rohini Gauba,"Rated Another place from Priyank Sukhija's bunch of joy, Lord of the Drinks. This huge place is set on 2 floors and has had almost 250 covers in total. Talking about the ambiance, everything is huge in literal sense. Leather couches, Plush furnishings, wall sized windows to give a spectacular view of the lights blinking on the road and red/yellow lightings to bright up the interiors yet creates a small cocoon for you to forget the world outside and enjoy with your set of people. On the other hand, the seating area on the terrace is more relaxed. Sprinklers and huge lights on the corners create a breezy weather. The playlist is AMAZING! I have been to LOD twice and was happy to see a humongous menu presented to me. I would agree to the fact that all of the similar Lounge & Bars have more or less similar menu but with a little twist in individual kitchen. So was the case with LOD. My favourite out of the menu was Gilafi Paneer: Paneer is cut out in a sheet and is stuffed with more paneer with some spices, rolled out and then cooked. This one is to die for. Sweet Chilly Paneer: Paneer chunks tossed in sweet-chilly sauce and sauted with chunks of onions, bell peppers and lemon grass. Peri-Peri Chicken: Slightly bigger pieces of chicken cooked with the peri-peri masala. Nachos: Would not suggest ordering this one as I wasn't happy with the presentation. The quantity is not that great for the Starters, you would end up ordering more but that's the plan, try more dishes from their menu. This place was jam-packed even on a Wednesday and can be termed as the most-trending place in Central Delhi. Happy Eating!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Udit Batra,"Rated Lord of the drinks is one good name for a place that stands out in almost every aspect possible for a restaurant that is themed on dim lit ambiance and amazing cocktails with quirky distinct flavours. Cocktails are their USP no doubt but what amazes me is the equally delectable food from various cuisines that turns out to be just the perfect companion for the drinks. Located opposite monkey bar on the outer circle of connaught place, the place is grand and spread across two floors, the staff is welcoming and helpful. The interiors have been done keeping in mind the USP to set a party mood for people looking to get over their problems and have a blast. DRINKS POWER STROKE LIIT- With four white spirits and triple sec added to a base of red bull this was quite a stroke full of power, they do have four other variants of the liit that look equally kicky and refreshing. MANGO MANIA- So this is another one that we all quite liked because of the fusion that happened when you mix mango and vodka, this one is highly recommended. FOOD CHEESE AND BAON FRIES- You just can't have enough of both fries and baon this one had a bit of pulled pork too but crispy baon and fries with drizzled cheese stole the show without a doubt. MURGH MALAI TIKKA- Abundantly flavoured tender juicy boneless pieces of chicken topped with sour cream and kasoori methi was truly the one not to be missed. FISH TIKKA- Tandoori boneless fish fillets in amritsari style marinade with a hint of fenugreek leaves was accompanied by a nice mint and yoghurt dip that stole the show. They also serve this platter with indian kebabs both veg and non veg that have a selection of their most delectable selection from the whole menu, do try their mutton seekh kebabs that are soft and juicy and have a dash of ginger in their after taste. After having tasted a truckload of appetisers we made the move to the main course:- Roti and boti is their mutton curry with boneless pieces served with lachha parantha, the gravy is rich and thick with very mild yet omnipresent flavours. Oriental prawn curry in oyster chilly sauce with fried rice was the dish that I probably liked the most in the main course because of the prawns being perfectly cooked and flavourful rice doing their part. Fish and chips is one American Classic that every Indian likes, my friend loved her choice and was satisfied with the batter fried fish served on bed of fries with a tartare dip. DESSERTS Endings are loved by all and remembered especially when they're sweet. Pancakes with chocolate syrup sauce were truly a delight to hava as they were soft and sweet, a must have to say the least. Salted Caramel- The name turned heads? Well at least it did turn mine, a true to the core delight is on your way when you ask for this one as it is this pastry base filled a lot of salted caramel that did wonders to my palate. Lord of the drinks is recommended for the partygoers and hardcore alcoholics or people who wish to enjoy to the fullest with nice peppy music, amazing cocktails, delectable food and above all a wonderful experience at a price point that is difficult to beat in delhi-ncr.",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Ankit Minglani,Rated Nice aerial view from the terrace top in the evening. Little overpriced if compared to similar cafes around cp but the view and the ambience makes up for it.

So we invited 80 fellow foodies and bloggers! We had a separate space reserved for us and well, a small beautiful cubicle too for the pictures! Lord of the drinks is luxurious and spacious cafe nestled in heart of the capital with an old world charm combined with plush comfort. Lord of the Drinks is inspired from the medieval world. The magnum place welcomes you to world that has best of interiors. Lord of the Drinks has many unique elements with them. Right from the best Medieval Interiors to Global comfort food, Lord of the drinks has it all. Coming to the food, the food served there was just top of the notch. Yeah granted it was a party and we did sort of have special treatment but then there's only so much modifications you can do. And LOTD for just brilliant! The concoctions of cocktails were good too and service decent too! Overall it was one amazing experience and you know that the party was great when youre terribly hungover on a Tuesday morning.

Bad things: 1: Hookah/Sheesha- Not the best of the hookahs, if you want to go for the best hookahs in CP, then you should prefer Vault Cafe.

Megha Khurana,"Rated Visited the place on 2nd Oct, i.e., a dry day, consequently the place was relatively empty. The food, the service, the drinks are certainly a drab. The only USP of the place is the ambience and the large terrace which is beautifully done. Although being overstaffed there was certain lack of coordination between the servers. The chicken tossed in peri peri sauce had a weird after taste and the pieces of chicken were hard and chewy. Ironically this was the dish suggested by one of the servers as a must have. The chicken clear soup with a dim sum was just to the point. The vegetable chilli cheese toast was the usual. It tasted decent enough. But the turn off was that the servers just took away the supplements (seasoning, chilli flakes, ketchup and mustard) in-spite of us saying that we need it and we are not finished yet. The hookah was good. But the servers just kept about coming every 2minutes to ask if the smoke was good and is the coal okay. Initially it was fine, but the regular bugging just gets irritating and certainly disrupts the ongoing conversations. And also, the valet once he took the car, they ask you to pay 100/- bucks or they are clear that you can park the car by yourself. The rating is only for the ambience.

The brilliantly done rustic decor will take you long back to some centuries old era. They have an indoor space and an outdoor terrace space. A small seating space is carved out of the outdoor terrace space from where you get an amazing view of the busy city lights, the statesman house and other buildings surrounding. When i saw the menu i was glad to see that even after the extravagant decor and massive space, everything is decently priced!!! We ordered our favourite beers, stella, corona, hoegarten!!! To eat, we ordered the garlic tossed chicken sausage, mozzarella sticks, and sweet corn soup. All tasted quite good considering that you cant be too much of a food critique when you re out drinking with your folks. One thing bad of the place was the service.

Rajeev Nangia,"Rated First , the disclaimer , though this place has been on my Togo list for a while , I actually went there just today and that too as a guest , hosted by the restaurant and a food blog , so , though I could not actually taste stuff of their menu , I got a fairly decent taste of their hospitality . So here goes , The Good , The Bad and The ..... Actually there were no uglies so just mostly the Good and just a bit of The Bad about the place. With so many new party places opening up every day , the repetitive sameness of the ambiance is such a put off , not here , the Medieval Castle theme of the place is a refreshing change and it is not just the feel Enhanced by the decor and the props , which include various full suits of armour and assorted medieval armoury but the SPACE , I know all caps is yelling , but the space here needs to be yelled out , huge , sorry , humongous actually , indoor level with a larger and better laid out terrace terrace . Real comfy seating , nicely spread out , giving one complete privacy . Am pretty sure that this is THE biggest party place in the vicinity . Big , yes , but also pretty amazing aquatics , the semi live music that was playing today evening was crystal clear , in spite of being loud ( in a good way ) it afforded conversation. Enough talk about the space and the setting , moving on , the service was pretty friendly and prompt , special mention of the great guys behind the bar . I started the evening with a glass of Apple Cinnamon , flavoured Sangria , with a red wine base . Am not a big fan of the way Sangria's are served in India , with a kick added , to make it more potent , to me Sangria is something you sip on for a long time for the refreshing feel and not the ""Kick"" , so it was a bad start , but in their defence , it was as fine a Sangria as you will find in most places in the NCR , so a neutral rating. Followed that first glass with a serve of regular Margarita , rocks and salt , now that was a well made drink , would have liked it to be more potent , but that is me , just being greedy , full marks. I ended my drinking for the evening with two pours of their house white , nicely chilled and crisp , consenting it was their house brand , I do not even know which brand ,excellent , if this is their well drink , can't wait to go back and taste one of their better vintages. Now for the bad , actually not bad but just not so good , here again a reminder of my disclaimer , the food / snacks I tried were not from the menu , but the pre set package kinds , so I can not be certain that they fairly represents the fare off their regular menu , well with the exception of a goat cheese bruschetta , they were all , both veg and non veg , very ordinary , not bad at all but defiantly not noteworthy , with nearly everything so close to perfect , I expected more from the food. So finally down to the real bad , actually more of a letdown . The guys here have a fairly decent selection of whiskies , all different variants , from famous blends to bespoken single malts , a nice selection for most , except me. Scotch is nice and all but not my poison of choice , was really disappointed with the limited selection of tequilas , vodkas and rums ( just two choices ) with the exception of vodka , where they had some top shelf brands the selection of these fun sprits ( as opposed to the stiff upper lip scotches ) was really limited. Another big put off was non availability of ingredients of their signature cocktail . Sure hope they right size there selection and mix at the bar. Complains taken care off , am surely going back some time real soon for , what I am certain will be a wonderful evening at this super party Center and would highly recommend the place for anyone looking for a kool party lounge.

Priyanka Singh,"Rated Lord of the drinks is again an added gem to the heart of the city, Connaught place, Delhi. It has been opened recently and has collected lot of accolades since its opening only. I was hearing a lot of praise from my friends too who have already been to that place, so that was enough for me to make my visit to the place soon. Luckily few days back only I was invited by my friend for a celebration party to the place hence my wish was fulfilled. It is a huge lovely property owned by Priyank Sukhija, having the grand look and luxurious feel with a comfy touch which is his forte as well. The place has a lovely square bar, decked up with all sorts of poison which one can think of at a very reasonable price, absolutely justifying its name and making it actually ""LORD OF THE DRINKS"". But that doesn't mean they don't have anything else than drinks. They serve pretty good food as well. Few of them which I got to try were Arancini balls, cheese crostinis, mushroom crostinis. They all were just perfect appetizers and went great with mocktails. After that I had chicken hot garlic and vada pav burger which were again bang on. Well prepared and tasty too. Later we were served chicken lolly pop and basil chicken, they were absolutely scrumptious and delight to have. After spending a wonderful time at their open terrace with our friends we got down and enjoyed the foot tapping music played by the live band. It was just a superb experience over all. By the time we were merry making the mains was served from which I tried chicken curry, paneer lababdar along with steamed rice. The mains were simple yet flavourful and yummy. Just loved it to the core. From the staff to the service must say everything was spik and span.

We ordered for : Mushroom BBQ Pizza : Finely Diced mushrooms and caramelised onions topped on a thin crust base with an apt amount of olive oil, Supera - Delicious ! Aglio Olio : A simple dish, with right amount of garlic, oil and chilli. And you can eat the whole of it ! Aracini Balls : Topped with Olives, these balls were almost perfect to taste with pesto dip. Lod Platter : A serving of all Indian Tandori Starters. There could have been more and better options in it. Dahi K Kebab : Very Soft, tender inside and crisp outside. Dahi melts in your mouth in a second ! Chilli Garlic Noodles : I loved very bite of them. A very basic, routine dish cooked amazingly ! Mushroom and Water Chestnut Dim sums : I could have hundreds of them : This Drooling ! Masala Chilli Cheese Fries : A disappointment. Not justified. Their BAR menu offers extensive range of drinks. A very few of them, we had : White Wine Sangria : I'm in Love with it. I had red wine as well, but the former one with cinnamonnails it !! Lord's Martini : A little on the sweeter side, a girl's drink I would say ! Watermelon is refreshing while basil, vanilla, and ginger were negligent in this vodka mix. Classic LIIT : As classic as it sounds. Ace of swords in Love : A tequila -(Little) spicy drink. Flavour of orange juice was prominent though ! A *Liked It* try ! Bira Beer : The Buraaaaahhhh Beer !/ Performances by the Rupin and Pooja made the evening better than before ! * Table Reservation is a must since LOTD is a new eye candy. * A lot of effort is put for the Ambience.

Prashant Singh,"Rated As the name says ""The Lord of the Drinks"" has fabulous pricing in their Bar menu. I very well remember that a pint of Kingfisher is for Rs. 85 only. Having an experience in this level of ambience at this pricing is just unimaginable. We were here for a private party with set menu on offering. I must say they have some fab starters. We had peri peri chicken, Olive Chicken Tikka and Lamb Kebab. All 3 are a must try. Chicken lolly pops are also good. The other starters were bruschettas, Crostinies, Arancini balls Vada and pao Burger. They all were ok and the chef needs to have a look into their bread quality. For the main course we had Chicken curry and Paneer Lebabdar along with rice and Indian Breads. Chicken curry was just too good and is a must try here. It is a little earthy and has a basic gravy, but it is very tasty. Overall this place is a typical Bar with cheap bar menu and not too expensive food. The music is also great here.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Urvashi Singh,"Rated Been here on a lazy Sunday afternoon, been here on a charged Saturday night, been here for a weekday office dinner. This place is such a delight ! Even though its extremely difficult to find a table on a Saturday night, but loved it still. Reasonably priced. And the terrace area is just beyond words. Come winters, and it is going to be ""the place"". Food is great ! And oh, they do have lovely dance artists on Saturday nights. Loved it, very promising !",Rated 4.5,6,21,??
Darshan Modi,"Rated The location is amazing at the corner of the outer circle. It has 2 levels of restaurants. The closed on the first floor is apt for people who enjoy loud music. The music is very good. They DJ is actually Djing. The place is spacious. The second floor is roof top. It has high tables and chairs which few couch area. They also have open space for dancing. The service is excellent. The food menu is elaborate. The name of the place is apt. You get almost all varieties of drink. They are literally the lord in that aspect. Since the place has opened just 2 months, few of the items on the menu were not available. But the waiter tried their best to suggest excellent alternative. The open space on 2 nd floor has a clear view of the Huge flag at the center of connought place.",Rated 4.5,18,131,??
Aamir Bashir,"Rated Happened to be here a couple of weeks back. The place is huge, and can be a bit overwhelming. But it really loses the plot when it comes to service and food quality. They have a huge menu which, honestly, is hard to justify. I had ordered Hakka Noodles - which were dry and lacked flavour - and some non-veg appetisers - which were not top of the shelf, along with some drinks. All in all, we raked a bill of close of INR 6000. It wasn't certainly worth the money.",Rated 2.5,7,2,??
Pria Arora,"Rated Worst place I have ever visited in Delhi!!! Apart from ambience there isn't anything you will find good. Service - 2/5 Food - 0.5/5 Price - 0.5/5 Meal portions - 1/5 We went there for team lunch & I must say each one of us regretted our decision of choosing LOTD. We ordered quite a lot of things; but sadly not even one thing tasted normal. I will have to describe item wise what went wrong each time - Veg Platter - Very limited variety, expensive, paneer was too hard Virgin Mojito - Either it was too salty or too sweet Chocolate & Oreo shake - no oreo to be found...too milky Cold drink - w/o gas...totally flat White sauce mushroom pasta - No mushrooms to be found in it :( but pasta was ok Red sauce pasta - Pathetic. We had to return it to them Dal makhani - Was served as sweet dish...no salt....extremely less portion Chilly garlic noodles - Too oily The only thing which was good was roti & onions...& yes the fudge brownie we had at the end...that was the only good part about it...as they say all's well that ends well?? May be not! Not in this case atleast.",Rated 1.0,9,54,??
Porus Arora,Rated The best part about the place is it massive and the roof has ample space to accommodate a lot of people. Book a table well in advance to get the best out of the lot and reach early to avoid hassle and save yourself from disappointment. I would recommend you to ask the service person to serve the alcohol right out of the bottle in front of you. After few drinks we took grey goose shots and it never tasted like the smooth syrup from France. The price for food is on higher side and the quantity is on lower side accompanied with average taste. Make it a point to pour your swing in front of your eyes ... Cheers,Rated 2.5,50,85,??
Satyapriya Siddhartha,"Rated Unbelievably terrible. So I went to check this place out because of the Fancy name. And honestly, the entire medieval thing that this place is trying to do, they failed at it. First sign, there are two armours when you actually enter the bar, and only one of them has a sword. If you're going to do something, do it right. Or don't do it at all. Then that red horse. My speculation is that it's the Trojan Horse with hidden soldiers, but it's been made so horribly that I felt like breaking it. And what's with the red creepy eye? So they had already lost me with ambience. They tried to put a bunch of things together, and failed miserably. Nonetheless, I decided to sit here and hoped that at least the food would be a redeeming quality. Spoiler alert. It wasn't. Firstly, we decided to go for the Kingfisher Pitcher, which the guys didn't have. Terrible start already. Dejected, we ordered a few pints of Kingfisher. But that's fine, maybe there's something that's keeping this place afloat. It has to be the food, right? So to start it off, we ordered the Mushroom BBQ pizza. Or the BBQ Mushroom pizza. I don't care if I'm getting the name right, because it's definitely not worth the asking price. The crust was burnt at a few places, the toppings were all over the place, this was not even worth half of what we paid for. Already regretting my decision to come here, we were ready to leave. But a part of my brain asked me to give it a second chance, and in the hopes that they possibly couldn't screw this up anymore, I ordered the Masala Chilli Cheese fries. Boy, was I wrong. They did manage to screw it up even more. Whatever the hell that was, that was not fit to be human food. Maybe not even cat food. Yes, it would seem like I'm being unfairly harsh, and looking at all the other reviews, I'm wondering if I was just pure unlucky to get all the crap here. But I did get crap here. So my review will not sugar-coat anything. This place sucks Final sum up. Ambience-1.5/5 (the idea wa good, but the abysmal negligence that the decor showed, I'm being generous here) Staff-3/5 (the only good thing in this shit hole. On one occasion, when they brought a somewhat warm beer, they were apologetic and instantly brought a cold one) Drinks-1/5 (IF YOU HAVE PROMISED ME CHEAP DRINKS, THEN YOU BETTER GIVE ME MY CHEAP DRINKS. And why the hell do you guys have warm beer anyway?) Food-1/5 (Everything was awful. 'nuff said) I never thought I'd say this, but do yourself a favour and go to My Bar. It's way better than this.",Rated 1.0,5,4,??
Robin Singh,"Rated Lord of the drinks is a super hit. Great sheesha's mouthwatering drinks and food. I loved everything about this place the ambience ,the music ,great staff . In drinks i tried my passion vodka and ace of swords tequila are what i feel one should must try. The best part is that I didnt even had to ask anyone to get the coal changed for the hookah they kept on changing it after every 10-15mins themselves which is just one of a part of their best service. Ceasers salad , bazzel fish ,dragon rolls keema pao ,murgh malai tikka were perfect and mouth watering and their brilliant presentation cannot hold one back and one would like to dig in straight away.

Neha Gupta,"Rated I had wanted to check this place out for its fancy name!! Finally visited this place with a close set of friends in a weekday evening and happily found a corner seating. The place was not crowded considering the weekday factor maybe. It covers a huge area and is very spacious. The ambience is exciting with decor done with crowns and swords and different kinds of seating arrangements. Coming to the drinks, the cocktails were nice and decently priced. We had ordered mojitos, chilli martini, and the regular beers and stuff. For the food, we opted for masala cheese fries that all of us loved!! Pizza, lasagna and nachos were just average. It's just like another regular outlet in cp which is good enough to at least try once when you are out with a bigger group with the idea of having fun in mind!!",Rated 3.5,32,101,??
Natasha Ahuja,"Rated Lord Of the Drinks is the newest place in town. It is located at the forvever hustling Connaught Place. Amidst many competitive Cafe and Lounges this place stands apart from all the other places in the vicinity. There is huge statue of a Metal Guard at the entrance. The place is pretty huge and it felt like as I have stepped in a Kingdom for a while. It has helmets all around the place. The bar certainly lives upto the name ""Lord Of The Drinks"". Then the main attraction is the terrace the view is simply breath taking. They also have air coolers to keep the atmosphere chill. Food Talk White Wine Sangria :- Was perfectly made had a really good peachy flavour in it. Classic Margarita :- Classic Margarita had a very crisp flavour of green olives. Was a very refreshing drink. Peri Peri Chicken :- This was the best item on the menu. Mild peri peri grilled to the perfect amount was delicious in taste. Drums of Heaven :- Drums of heaven cooked in chili garlic sauce served with fresh onions was very fresh and good. Murg Tikka LababDar :- Very Creamy and Juicy Chicken will surely kill your food cravings. On the whole I had a good experience.

The music is considerably good and the food was okayish. Not the best of service provided to you, unlike what the huge restaurant attracts you for.

Christina Peter,"Rated Very few restaurateurs could have managed to get their hands on the space LOD has and Mr. Sukhija and gang is probably on top of that list. Prime space in CP is no joke especially when the rooftop has such a beautiful view. Well done team LOD. Landed here on a Sunday afternoon with friends who BTW are all AA members now thanks to the extensive Bar Menu. And the second visit was the very next evening for Hmm 2nd yr anniversary celebration. The entrance is guarded by knights, the staircase is dimly lit in yellow lights and the bar is no doubt the centre of attention. Drinks: Berry Cosmo- The classic drink with a twist sponsored by Red Berry Sorbet, cranberry juice and a generous splash of vodka Rouge LIIT- Vodka, Rum, Tequila with Strawberry is a peculiar flavored drink- an acquired taste I say Mango and Chilli Martini- Tequila gives you the high, Chili contributes to the heaty factor and Mango calms the mouth that's set on fire by the combination of Chili and Tequila Sangria- I tried both Red and White and am unable to decide if the liked the white with the hint of cinnamon better or the classic Red one with bits of Apple Aces of Swords in Love- Interesting name and even better taste. Tequila, red bell pepper, coriander, orange juice and spices...highly recommended! Food: Bacon and Pork Fries- Crisp fries topped with shredded well cooked Pork and bacon that is purely happiness. A must try Dahi Ke kebab- crisp on the outside and soft, melt in the mouth from inside packed with flavor of cardamom is delicious Keema Pav- Not only does this looked appetizing, it tasted equally good. The keema was flavorful and pav was the perfect accompaniment Garlic tossed Chicken Sausages- Chicken Sausages tossed in bell peppers, garlic and mixed herbs makes for a perfect starter Four seasons very dimsums- I hate veg dimsum (most veg things to be honest) but the ones at LOD are yumm. Thin dimsum sheets with generous filling of veggies served with two dips LOD Non veg platter- A mix of kebabs and Tikkas served with the classic mint chutney and onions is huge in size and filling Roti aur Boti- Slow cooked mutton in thick fragrant gravy served with Maida roti is a meal in itself and I'm salivating as I recall and write Aglio Olio- The classic spaghetti dish, garlic, olive and Chilli flakes..classic example of how simple things in life can bring immense pleasure Chilli garlic noodles- Taking something as basic as that and taking it to the level LOD did is no joke mister and I wouldn't mind going back only for this sometime soon Pork Spare Ribs- tender, cooked to perfection, falling off the bone pork ribs smeared with a fragrant garlicy sauce us an absolute winner. Never has a piggies earned so much respect from me! Arancini Balls- Tomato and cheese risotto balls served with pesto dip and topped with black olive is the perfect finger food BBQ Mushroom Pizza- Caramelized onions and mushrooms in BBQ sauce spread on a Thin Crust Pizza Desserts: Brownie- Crusty on the outside and gooey on the inside, slightly warmed and drizzled with chocolate sauce is a dessert lover's delight Chocolate Tart- Gooey chocolate on a biscuit base with hidden nuts...one bite and you're on your way to dessert heaven. I've never had a better dessert in my entire life. It's Delicious, True Foodgasm moment and Orgasmic! LOD is a gem of a restaurant dishing out delicious food and it managed to impress me with its dark, cozy setting, live band performances, impeccable service, wide spread of drinks and limpsmackingly good food. This place could easily be on The Strip, great and intriguing interiors, well trained and super polite staff, interesting and extensive menu and a Great Cocktails lineup...

Karan FoodFanatic,"Rated 'All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us' Last weekend I decided to pay a visit to the trending restaurant that is located in heart of the Capital, Lord of the Drinks along with my fellow foodies for a tasting session. This new addition to the already existing plethora of swanky eateries in Connaught Place seems to fit in well and this can be proved by its gaining popularity lately. Spanning across two floors, LOD occupies around 18,000 square feet. A flight of stairs will take you up to this enormous restaurant that gives off a contemporary aura combined with a fantasy feel. One is bound to notice the humanoids and the armours set in the earthy color tones that pervade the entire place. Sitting goes from the plush rexine leather sofas to chairs to wooden benches. If these don't suit your comfort and you wish to enjoy the weather, then you may sit on the terrace area which overlooks the bustling lanes of CP. A huge red horse will welcome you while you take the terrace stairs. I would have appreciated if they would have had some references of Lord of the Rings in their menu but alas, it didn't. Their menu offers Italian, Indian, Chinese along with a few American dishes. As the name itself would suggest, LOTD is extravagantly equipped with a wide assortment of drinks. My journey at LOTD had started with a glass of red wine and white wine sangria, both of which were nice and strong but were a bit jittery due to the uneven dicing of the apples. This was paired along with some spicy Prawn Chermoula, which tasted great along with the yellow pepper mayonnaise. The drums of heaven, slithered in sweet and spicy sauce tasted great but somehow lacked in presentation. My expectations had gone down when I tried the crispy conjee lamb which was a bit too over fried and hence, was chewy and lacked flavour. But luckily, the other dishes came to rescue and saved the day for me. Four seasons veg dimsums looked inviting and tasted nice with the spicy sauce that came along with it. The arancini balls, though not authentic, tasted rather good with the spices and the crisp outer layer. The baby aloo chatpata had stolen the show for me. Crispy baby potatoes covered with masalas and topped off with sweet curd. The dahi ke kebab didn't disappoint me a bit. The bbq and mushroom pizza, though tasted unusual in the first bite, went along well in the following bites. I combined this with a very refreshing Pomegranate and basil cooler. Even though the Power Stroke LIIT forced me to think of the better LIITs that I've had before, the thought stopped when I had a sip of Ace of Swords in Love. It was time to reach my destination and hence, ordered Lemon tart with blueberry compote and chocolate. The lemon cheesecake in itself had the perfect amount of acidity and sweetness, but unfortunately was overpowered by the acidity of the blueberry compote on top. The chocolate tart was without doubt the winner in the desserts with extra chocolate sauce added to make the experience even more indulgent. Overall, my experience at Lord of the Drinks turned out to be fairly good. The errs in the service are something that any newly opened restaurant are bound to face. A tiny bit of work on the food and an improved service can bring about a big change at LOTD and make it all the more successful. It definitely has the capacity to make someone feel no less than the LORD. Cheers karanfoodfanatic.wordpress.com",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Urvi Barman,"Rated The Lord of the Drinks is definitely building excitement and fun among Delhiites. Newly launched by Mr. Priyank Sukhija, the outlet is located in Connaught Place - New Delhi. I was overawed and speechless when I saw the place. The restaurant occupies a space of 18000 sq feet, boasts about its microbrewery and an open air night club. Still not enough? Lets take a look at the Ambiance & Food - Ambiance -- The interiors is mostly wooden and metal. If you have huge gatherings for a Big party, tis the place to be. Decor is amazing and ambiance has all elements like armours, helmets, spears and humanoids. Food Talk -- The food menu is vast and the drinks section is nicely done keeping in mind both classes and masses. We opted for Chicken Wings, Fish Fingers, Chermoula Vegetables, Baby Aloo Chatpata, Arancini Balls, Dahi ke Kebab and BBQ Mushroom Pizza. And ofcourse, Sangria! Chicken wings and Fish fingers were good. Baby Aloo Chatpata is a chatpati chaat kind of a dish made using lots of potatoes, chaat masala and creamy curd. Arancini Balls with the dip were soft and nice. Oh, Dahi ke Kebab is a must have for all those who are fond of the street food snacking. Kebabs so soft that they melt in your mouth. BBQ Mushroom Pizza, flavorful however, I found it a bit too tangy. Overall, a fun, vibrant, warm place to be.

Ridhi Arora,"Rated Another addition to the list of caf in Connaught place, this one however really need to pull up its game for it to be successful. Mixed feelings with the entire experience. We were a group of 13 people, service was extremely slow although the staff was courteous but took way too long to get the orders be it the main course or drinks. Food ordered: Chill chicken (good), chicken lollipop (tasted bland - chicken was too hard), chicken tikka (good), chilly paneer (tasted the usual), white sauce paste (absolutely delicious), red sauce pasta (equally bad with no taste of the gravy - by far the worst pasta tried ever), pizzas - both veg and non veg were good We also ordered wontons which 1. The waiter could not understand what we meant and 2. We're never served! I ordered red wine - wasn't the best I have tasted 1 a little tangy after taste - although I wish the glass in which the wine was served was a little classy ;) We also tried the flaming shots which was fancy but overpriced.

Divya Srinivas,"Rated I'd been wanting to check this place out owing to the plush adornment, fantastic location and importantly the smart play with the words in the name of this place! But alas, all that glitters is not gold. My friend and I, loved the place only because of the interior, the way the mist sprayed through different points on their terrace making it extremely pleasant and comfortable to hang out there, and the excellent view of Connaught Place they accorded. The service was just fine. The food was something we both would place before the level of being terrible. We ordered Quesadillas, which didn't taste like one at all. Moreover it was priced for 465 with 4 slices/portions. It tasted more like homely cooked vegetable curry stuffed inside tawa rotis. Not that we'd mind that, but the one served to us was rued by our taste buds and was not at all sumptuous or delicious. I'm still willing to give them a second chance and recommend a good review provided I'm not met with disappointment next time wrt the food. Until then 2.5 is also a tad much for my experience.",Rated 2.5,5,173,??

Gurleen Chauhan,"Rated So I happen to go to this place totally unplanned. Midnight hunger pangs and a lazy Saturday night gave me no reason of staying home and ordering food so just drove to cp hoping someone would welcome me and serve me food. Lord of the Drinks, was my first pick, and how glad I was for making this choice. Thanks to the restaurant manager Mr. Surendar who welcomed us in after refusing on the first call, but agreeing later when I told him I only want to have some food. His main issue was the kitchen shutting down at 12am, but he still managed to get us a table, place our order and served us our food within minutes of ordering it. A spicy paneer burger, a stuffed grilled chicken , and penne in pink sauce was our hunger cure. Having being treated so generously, I left this place all the more happy.

Hema Sharma,"Rated The name and theme of this restaurant seems inspired from the movie Lord of the Rings. My husband had this restaurant on his mind from quite a time and finally we decided to dine there on Saturday. I called the restaurant for booking in the afternoon but I was informed that its fully booked and I may try my luck if I decide to come there in the evening. Since, we already had made our minds to go there, we went .As I went in I was surprised to see that the place was super spacious and yet completely filled. We also checked the terrace seating and even that was filled due to some private party. We checked with the manager and she said that we can wait at the bar and in case any table gets free she will inform us. We decided to wait and luckily in 10 mins we got the table. The dcor of this place gives you a feel of being in a section segregated in a kingdom for their artillery. The display of swords, humanoids, spears, shields etc gives this place a very different and untamed look. The lighting was dim and the music was loud but it went with the feel of this place. We had couple of drinks and I liked their cocktail my passion. Considering the fact that the place seemed ideal for drinks I had low expectations from the food. However, the food too seemed good. We ordered Crumb fried paprika chicken and it was delicious. The chicken was succulent inside and perfectly crispy outside. Another dish we ordered was Alfredo Pasta which too was fine. I also liked their service, especially due to the fact that the place was super crowded yet we didnt have to wait long for our drinks and dishes.

Neha Singh,"Rated LOTD is a higher end MyBar version for me - a larger space , a larger crowd , a larger menu offerings - everything is large about this place . Located on first floor in G block of outer circle in connought place , this place is easily visible - thanks to multiple boards in black & orange displaying its presence to the crowd . The management here has actually cashed on this phrase - ""Jo dikhta hai , wo bikta hai"" , bcoz these large hoardings do attract a lot of crowd here esp in the night . Me & my friends were also attracted to this place and had bookmarked it for a visit on some next occasion . Finally , we visited this place for a friendz birthday celebration on a Friday evening. Luckily for us we got a reservation made here beforehand , as we were told wen we reached there around 6 in the evening that the lounge is houseful (even around 6pm) and only terrace seating was available . The interiors are designed like those of medieval times era having a theme based on those fyting arenas/war places (hence i guess a name matching with lord of the rings) with iron soldiers , swords hanging on the walls , steel chains all over the staircase . This place is really really huge having couches seating all over the place . The ambience here is very dark and music is very loud . Menu is quite extensive both in food and drinks . On our visit here , we ordered my passion and LIIT(Rogue) cocktails , pomegranate & Basil cooler and pineapple & mint cooler mocktails. They have a variety of LIITs available with them which I really liked . All the drinks were made fine and had a good taste . For the food we ordered Soy chilli panner , Bbq mushroom pizza , Masala chili cheese fries , tomato sauce pasta , Spicy paneer mix burger , Dahi ke kabab , Lod veg club sandwich , Greek salad with feta chicken & chicken and coriander salad. To my surprise food here was good , contrary to my usual experience at places specialising in drinks . Their soy chili paneer was outstanding and is a must order here as per me. All other dishes were good to taste too , only disappointment being the burger which dint taste good and was very dry to eat . Service is prompt and staff is friendly . The place is bit expensive esp the food segment . But this place does offer a great ambience overall to spend a nice evening with your friends. Definitely worth a try !!",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Shweta Aggarwal,"Rated Lord of the Drinks is a newly opened casual dining restaurant located in the G Block of Connaught Place. Spread across two floors, the place has a massive sitting area with very comfortable furniture. The interior is inspired by the era of kingdoms with very dim lighting and good music complementing the food. It was an invitation by the restaurant to review the place. We started with Sangria and Adams LIIT but that day I was in no mood to have alcohol so I chose a mocktail - Pomegranate with Basil leaves. It was really reviving with the freshness of both pomegranate and basil leaves, a very blissful combination. In food, we opted for Chermoula Vegetables, European Appetizers felt like salad but mixed with yellow pepper mayo, Baby Aloo Chatpata, a tasty chaat made of baby potatoes with chaat masala and sweet creamy curd, Arancini Balls, went really well with the dip, Dahi ke Kebab were so soft that they were melting in my mouth without making any effort, Four Season Veg Dim sums were filled with lots of veggies and were going really well with the chili sauce and the last food item was Bbq Mushroom Pizza, I was a little disappointed with this though it was cooked properly and the Bbq sauce was also flavorful, but the essence of tamarind was a bit strong. In desserts, we ordered Blueberry cheesecake and chocolate tart. Both were lip-smacking especially Chocolate Tart, I was loaded with chocolate sauce as well. I liked the place and found it perfect to organize parties for many people. The place surely offers a good time with food and positive ambiance. thefoodiefling.blogspot.com",Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Sumit Gupta,"Rated Places like Lord of the Drinks make you recognize the importance of good service. We went in at around 7 in the evening and we asked if we could get a table in the open terrace area. It was almost fully occupied and the floor manager offered a rather uncomfortable place to us. Asked him whether it would be possible to get us a table at the first floor which he tersely replied to go check downstairs. Only when I insisted that he should find out and let me know that he sent one of his staff, reluctantly. Finally, after getting a table we ordered Som Tam salad, keema pao, chicken lasooni tikka and a couple of beers. The server took an awfully long time to find out that som tam salad wasn't available. Ordered their loaded nachos instead. The nachos were fine. The keema pao however oddly tasted like pao bhaji :-/ Was disappointed. To add to my disappointment, the server insisted that we never ordered chicken lasooni tikka when we reminding him about our order. Since, we didn't have much time, we didn't bother and left the place. Needed to ask for fork to two different servers before one of them finally hunted down a pair of forks for us. Ditto for water.

Sidhant Ahuja,"Rated Lord Of the Drinks is located at the G Block of Connaught Place. It is located at the first floor and occupies two floors. The first and the second. It is a massive restaurant with plethora of seating arrangement.It is on of the best theme restaurants in Delhi. The decor is chic and classic and is inspired by the kings and lords. It has very dim lighting and it kind of suits the place. Drinks Green Apple and Cinnamon White Wine Sangria :- This was the perfect Sangria. The white wine used was of really good quality. Adams LIIT :- Adams LIIT was a perfect blend of Vodka , Rum , Tequila , Gin , Green Apple and Lemonade. This is a perfect summer drink to quench your thirst. Food Talk Spicy Chicken Dumplings :- This was the best dish on the menu. Minced Chicken in the perfectly curved dimsum was just scrumptious in taste. Peri Peri Chicken :- Juicy and soft chicken made in the perfect Peri Peri Sauce was delectable in taste. Tandoori Chicken Burger :- It was a very different Burger. Minced chicken in the burger served with french fries and mayonnaise was a treat to the taste buds. Loved it absolutely. Stuffed Chicken Breast :- Very tender and juicy Chicken Breasts filled with mushrooms. This dish was very delicious and was further served with Sauted vegetables. We had New York CheeseCake for desserts. It was luscious in taste topped with blueberry sauce is highly recommended for Cheese Cake lovers. We also tried the Watermelon and Kiwi Mint Hookah. Hookah is a must try at this place. Another thing I would like to point out is that they have separate staff entirely to cater for the hookah needs.

We chose to sit inside on sofa seats and then started with pictures and cake cutting. We ordered their peri peri chicken pizza , green lantern pizza , paneer tikka and peri peri pasta for starters along with orange and strawberry slush , green apple with chilli as mocktails. It was strange to know that they didnt had neither kingfisher now tuborg even mentioned in menu. So we chose budweiser beer at last. The pizzas were tasty and i really liked the chicken pizza. For main course we opted for mostly chinese including veg hakka noodles , veg chilli garlic noodles , chicken in schezwan sauce and veg Manchurian. I was pretty satisfied with the taste. Their bar is so big and captured that as well for memories. The rooftop was amazing specially if u wanna have hookah in pleasant weather.

Definitely there was something wrong either the alcohol was fake or food was stale because everyone had crazy headache and stomach infection the next morning.

Value for money is great, drinks and food are quite reasonably priced. Might make for a great night out. Food was the big disappointment for me personally. Ordered chicken wings for starters and a tenderloin steak. The wings were generously proportioned but lacked flavour. The steak unfortunately was a nightmare. It was supposed to be medium rare but was just raw. They did not have steak knives which is a big turn off and makes eating the steak so tedious. Service was terrible too. No one escorted us to a table. Not once were we able to get a server's attention without getting up from our table, the food took at least 45 minutes to arrive after being advised 20.

First thoughts, the knight's armour suit at the entrance gate - impressive. The stairs and the wire mesh chandelier at the top of the stairs - all add to the build up. And then you enter into this huge space that eyes cannot gather at one go.. Even a panorama pic would be insufficient to capture the length and breadth of the space these guys occupy. We sat at one end of the lounge and couldn't see the other. We ordered a pitcher of the Tropical LIIT. And boy was it strong! Another one of those, and we would've been flying! So kudos to the bartender!!! For food we ordered the chicken tandoori platter. It was okayish. The platter was a mix of mutton seekh kebabs, chicken tikka, fish ka some starter. You couldn't make out from the look of it, which meat was which except for the seekh kebabs. One of the pieces of chicken I got was undercooked and that was a big downer! The most amazing part is the ambiance of the place. You can try out the metal helmets kept along the windows - SO COOL!!! And we actually did try them out! The music is loud enough.

The place is huge, with dim lighting, metallic interiors, a luring bar, pretty loud music and comfortable sitting. Do yourself a favour, and choose the TERRACE SITTING once its dark. It's soo pretty and would make a perfect romantic setting. They have a variety of drinks. PEACH MOJITO being my favourite, as the taste of peach in cocktails is refreshing as well as sweet. VIRGIN MOJITO was a little too minty than the normal mojitos. Apart from that, FISH FINGERS were something that is light, crisp and tasty. CHILLI CHICKEN (SAY CHILLI) was chicken balls dipped in chilli sauce, and had a pleasant taste, Gravy. PANEER TIKKA had big pieces of paneer, nice quantity, but a little overcooked. An attractive name, THREE LITTLE PIGGIES PIZZA was something that I tried. Loaded with piggies; Pulled pork, sausages and pepperoni. It was served on a BBQ sauce which made it a lot sweeter. The combo of piggies was the best that I ever had, only wishing to eliminate the BBQ Sauce. They have a great staff employed; made our friend's birthday a total hit.

We ordered a pitcher of sangria which was slightly high on the sweet part. Their cranberry juice is also nicely made. The chili mushroom, chili chicken and French fries ordered by us were nicely done. The taste was appropriate and spices were adequate and well mixed. We ordered a sheesha with green apple and mint as flavor. This was the best thing among everything we ordered for. The bill was around 4000.

Vijay Sinha,"Rated Went to this place with my friend on a sat evening. I have heard that despite being one of the biggest lounge bars in Delhi you don't get a seating here after 10pm. Which shows that this place gets a serious footfall of diners. Luckily we got our table without waiting and also in the main room. Interiors match with the name and and it looks grand. Now food. We ordered just one dish because whenever I check out a new place I usually keep less items to avoid regret in the end. It was ""Grilled fish with steamed veggies"" with some mayo mixed sauce. And two regular Kingfisher Ultra. Domestic beer starts at Rs. 85 (ya i know) but I pretty much understand this tactic. I guess they are locking horns with the neighbours. Nevertheless the fish was excellent, grilled just to perfection. Though I felt salt was little on the higher side. Service was quick and the staff seemed quite alert to customers.

Visited the place with 6 other people on a Sunday night, we had no issues in getting a table as we had made prior reservations (which i would highly recommend in case you plan on visiting on a weekend). The service was horrible. It took them an hour to get our drinks, which weren't anything elaborate, just some beers and vodka. The food also took about half an hour to come, which was understandable owing to the crowd, but it still does not explain how it took them so long to get our beers. After having asked the waiters on numerous occasions we called for the manager and got our remaining order cancelled. Only recommended for people who have the patience to wait and bear with the pathetic level of service, or you could go on a day it is less crowded.",Rated 2.0,2,63,??

I had the most horrible experience ever, the place is pretty big but the service here is absolutely RIDICULOUS. We ordered appetizers and drinks which took a while to come and then went on to order main course. The main course didn't come till an HOUR. We sat there waiting for our food for an hour despite repeatedly requesting the staff and managers to provide quicker service. At last, we cancelled our order and left. This place doesn't value its customers AT ALL. Agreed, it's a new restaurant and the crowd is overwhelming but I'd just ask once question, why allow so many people when you don't have the staff and expertise to handle it? I really hope you work on your service soon otherwise this place will lose its customers.

To start with the positives...this place is massive compared to cp standards and the decor is neat. Terrace is well done with good sprinklers cooling the atmosphere and good lighting.The inside seating is also really comfortable with good comfy sofas and quite good options available. The place is not overpriced as well when compared to other sister lounges. The chilli cheese toast,paneer sandwhich,hakka noodles are good. Now the negatives....the service is like really lame. The staff doesn't know what is there in the menu. I ordered for a veg ball manchurian to which they said yes and gave me vegetables in manchurian sauce. Also took them almost an hour to get me a normal lemon ice tea which was like an overdose of vitamin C. The AC temperature made u feel like ur in arctic and they couldn't help it they said. The portions were really small like for 1 and a half person. Also they do not have much options for deserts. They ran out of cold beer the other day and the beer wasn't cold enough which was disappointing. They should rename baked potato to boiled potato,may be add some fresh juices(as they had none available),increase their portions. Hopefully they will improvise as the place should turn good.",Rated 2.5,7,3,??

And obviously the name suggest this pasta is soo creamy . I didnt like the garlic bread which they served with pasta. It was too hard to bite. The veg lasagna was not at all good. So much of oil , no taste , no taste. Bland . But the best part which i liked about this place is that the chef itself came to talk about the food and the presentation . He asked us should there be any improvement in the food or anything . He was quite humble. On the top of it u will never feel that u are being ignored by any waiter .

It's only been 10 days this place opened up and I was shocked by the crowds they have attracted already. Everyone is talking about LOD everywhere. Pricing is not too high.

We ordered Peri peri chilli paneer pizza, schezwan panerr and Alfredo pasta. Each and every dish was amazing, specifically schezwan paneer, it was awesome. The only disappointment was the seating area which was offered to us, it was totally isolated from the main area, though we requested for a change but since the place was jam packed we couldn't get any other seat. And one more thing which I would like to mention is that the outlet is barely 15 days old, so i don't think people should judge the staff this early. I am sure they must have gone through training but this might be there first practical experience and i don't think anybody here would like to be judged at their job on the basis of first few days.

Located on the Outer Circle in the heart of Delhi, the place is ideally located. The ambience was nice with dim lights, well placed metal crowns gave the place a unique touch. This is the best thing about Priyank. All his places are unique and different. You have to actually be there to experience it. The Retro music in the background made the place really lively on a dull Monday afternoon. The service was nice. An interesting touch to the place was the pool table. The plates were not the regular ones. It definitely caught our eye. The quality of food was nice. We ordered Mushroom stroganoff, Soy Chilli and Veg au gratin, all three which we highly recommend.

The ambience is fantastic. The place is tastefully decorated with chandeliers and Greek armours that actually make this lounge "" Lord Of The Drinks."" You can either plonk yourself on a comfortable sofa in a quiet corner to enjoy a glass of exotic wine or be at the centre of the Bar, this tavern is spacious. At no point you feel overwhelmed or get elbowed by the crowd, there is enough room for everybody. The DJ closely follows the pulse of the crowd and belts out foot-tapping numbers accordingly, from EDM to Hard Rock to latest Bollywood numbers you can't help swaying to. Order Mojitos, they are quite decent here or a classic brand of whisky. Better still settle for a pitcher of LIIT if your friends are driving you back. Statutory warning: Don't share LIIT with them. The food menu is exhaustive, you will find a variety of pizzas, shashliks and good ol' chicken stroganoff on the menu. You can order chicken wings to go with your drinks. If you like desi stuff go for Kadai murgh and wash it down with beer. The Lord Of The Drinks is inviting and I can't be rude and say not to the LORD. I'm definitely going there are again...

Music is good and ambiance is dark we took the F PDR in the corner nice pink couches, all people wish for is a dance floor, but they have to stop their urge. Menu is typical and food is good, rather standard food at a hefty price. excellent food with very reasonably priced alcohol, nothing more you can really ask for. The quantities are fairly decent yet light enough for one to enjoy the food without getting a feeling of being too full. The staff is polite (Surender) and well informed and the music is played at a decent decibel so that people can actually make conversations.

Jasmeen G Dugal,"Rated A split-level 18,000 sq ft alfresco lounge and tapas bar with a commanding view of Connaught Place the man behind some of the most successful restaurants and lounges in Delhi NCR launched the much-awaited 'Lord Of The Drinks' last week. Packed on any given day, Priyank Sukhija's hotspot has Retro music, mammoth cocktail list, delicious tapas and artistic interiors including priceless collectors' swords! When it has so much to offer, I can't do it justice with a single review so now I'm going to talk about the tapas I relished and Part II will be a pure cocktail review since the bar boasts of flavourful unique cocktails like whiskey-based mojito! Already a hotspot for the city's fashionistas, teens and families with a waiting queue that snakes around the block, the decor is neo-casual, minimalist and medieval. But what really makes 'Lord Of The Drinks distinct is its cuisine. The menu is a well conceived and executed result of fine-tuning, experimenting and pushing the envelope to achieve a masterful menu! It's a determined effort to match imagination with experience. I call it the rejuvenation menu, as I could swear I felt light after dinner! I even discovered that what's so enticing about it is that dishes we didn't select were as appealing as those we did a compelling reason to return! Tapping my foot to Retro favourites, I ordered a melt-in-the-mouth mushroom crostini and smoked chicken bruschetta. Both were light, layered, flavourful. This was followed by finger lickin' delicious keema pav; the chef hails from Mumbai and hence there's a strong influence of Mumbai street-style food. Up next was 'Drums Of Heaven' and 'Lamb Bulgogi'. The shredded lamb poached in chilli paste and sesame oil rendered it light and moist. Slow cooking it released and maintained natural flavours and juices from this succulent lamb. Everything works well with the chicken drums too as it balances taste, texture and portion. I recall using my fingers to hold the drums as I would bite off big chunks of tender, succulent chicken well-seasoned and infused with natural flavours. Yes, once again restaurateur Priyank Sukhija has contrived a passionate feast of the senses; the life expectancyof bars and restaurants may beshort butthe huge property with a lively ambience, pool table in a corner, conscientious service, well-priced cocktails and tapas will make ' Lord Of The Drinks' a game changer! I, for one, can' t wait to visit again and try some more dishes from the menu spanning pizza and pasta, dimsums, Chinese, Indian and European cuisine! Bon Appetite!

Was in a doubt of visiting this place ( going by mixed reviews on Zomato ) The place was full packed, no place to sit. After 5 minutes of wait we were given a table and thats it. They know how to make a walk in feel privileged. :D Sheesha was amazing !!!! Foood was fuddin good ;) I am more of a beer guy, but still tried their Daiquiri and Liit, not a bit of disappointment. I suppose the people reviewing it badly have issues with themselves. I found it totally perfect. Wasn't able to click photos of food/drinks, as I was already so fascinated seeing the ambience. But yes did manage to get one photo. With the man himself, Mr. Priyank. It was great seeing him taking care of small things around. Kudos !! With - Divita Daukia",Rated 5.0,34,265,??

Very hep crowd , even for a weekday. Perfect place for a get together However, the only sore point here, is the treatment met out to the stags, as the floor manager came to our table and said "" Sir, stags are not allowed to dance"".

Himadri,"Rated 1.5 is for the ambience. This new place is for hookah, booze and appetizers. We don't expect such kind of hospitality from a brand who owns the chains of restaurants. The music is way too loud and unpleasant, would have accepted the loudness if it could complement the drinks and seesha. The food is not ""such a happening"" to go for nor the ""drinks"". Yeah, if you dont like your drink you will surely be given the ""technical"" explanation by the management that this is how the drink is prepared, and that is how it they have made it and if you want pineapple we have another drink because blueberries are thick!! .. man, you should not have written it in the menu at first place. Now comes to the hospitality, you will be served food but no spoon, and the management will again explain to you that ""because usually the people eat appetizers from hand so we dont need it"" at least provide with serving spoons!! ..you have to ask for the sauce, else they won't provide it. 1000 rupees for two people, for handful of fries and a couple of sausages chopped and the quantity is less. They're new and I hope in future they focus in the betterment of the hospitality instead of giving lame excuses and explanation. Good luck.. Thanks",Rated 1.5,68,345,??

We ordered few breezers liit pitcher beer and a mocktail (I'm sorry I don't remember the name). For food we ordered nachos which were loaded with beans and cheese. But they weren't one of the best I've had for a place like this it was average. Aloo chat was so yum. Ordered two servings. Dahi k kebab yes they were super yum. Soft and full of flavours.

The best part done is division; like proper dine in is on one side with that certain area covered with old time school mess wooden benches ( and i loved it ) and the remaing done like a cafe type. Overall a place for all. Music played is good, hope to see sufi gigs coming in here. Food : we ordered the following stuff; Nachos, Mozeralla sticks, bbq mushroom pizza, alfredo pasta, vegetable agautin, hakka noodles and kadhai paner combo. Out of the above bbq mushroom pizza was just amazing, something new in taste. It was perfectly cooked with flavours of bbq in it, little spicy and more of the smokey flavours in the sauce, mushroom and cheese all over the base. Nachos and veg agautin were dissapointing. Nachos missed everthing, there should have been more of sliced onion tomato with sour cream and salsa dip over it. Veg agautin, the veggies were not baked perfectly and they missed cheese over it ( it was there, but it was equivalent to not to be there ) Summing up, overall a nice experience. Food items those i left in reveiewing were perfectly cooked had almost the same taste like every other good outlet in town has of Mr. Sukhijha.

Arsheen Kaur,Rated Lord of the drinks being a part of Priyank Sukhija's joints had to be visited. we went there for lunch. The place is huge with great ambience. But the staff really really needs training. The waiters don't know the menu at all and hence were of no help while ordering. The service was so slow that we had to wait for at least 15-20mins between each appetiser. The food tasted average and the drinks were just fine. The worst part of it was when we ordered blueberry cheesecake and we were served a DUMMY CAKE SLICE. How can they be so so dumb to serve a dummy slice. Really very disappointing. Though I appreciate that the chef himself served us a fresh slice later but again it didn't taste any better. I wonder if i will visit this place again.,Rated 2.0,10,76,??

Bani,"Rated I always wanted to visit this place since the time "" coming soon"" banners had been put up.Finally I did visit the place yesterday and was pretty impressed by the ambience,its done up really well...has a medieval feel to it!! But the servers were really lost and had no idea about any of the food that was there in the menu,for eg.under the section of ""Loaded Fries"",there is an option of pork n bacon so when we asked the guy taking our order if it would be a bowl of French Fries with bacon n pork strips on it...he said that it would be a pork chop with bacon strips so we went ahead and ordered it( as we r not particularly fond of French Fries)...but when the order came in...it was exactly like how we had thought it would be- French fries with bacon strips and shredded pork!!!! When we pointed this out to the guy who took our order,he just played dumb...anyways, we ordered the beef burger and it was yum...so I guess the tastiness of the food actually makes up for the dumbness of the waiters.Another thing is too many people come and take your order...but I guess these are just teething problems!!!

Sushant Kamra,Rated It was a treat to be at Lord of Drinks which really reminded me of those Hollywood movies which used to have Great Vintage Bar nd Clubs As always it was expected to have a great food as Priyank always ensures 5 star quality food served to customers nd icing on the cake was introduction of pool / billiards table which kept us more engaged amongst group...@ Thnks Priyank for a heavenly 5 star place like many others!! Will refer to everyone,Rated 5.0,1,20,??
Anshoo Gupta,"Rated I went to this place because I had heard a lot about it. But I was very disappointed after reaching. We waited for an hour for a decent table. The food was good. The drinks, however were a huge disappointment. The service was HORRIBLE. I have been to many places in Delhi but I haven't seen service of such a poor standard ANYWHERE. I will never come back to this place again. The manager, Sunil Sharma should learn to be more respectful and courteous towards his guests.",Rated 1.0,2,25,??
Shivam Gupta,"Rated Okay so this is the worst place that has opened by a LONG way. We were four people. As we walked in there were at least four tables empty for four people but we were accommodated in a table of TWO. After an hour of complaining, we finally got a decent table. Food was not that great but the chilli garlic noodles were awesome. Don't even get me started with the service. The waiters must've been partially deaf. We waited for our starter for an hour after which we were told that he never took the order. Shoutout to the manager, Mr Sunil Sharma for being a total noob.",Rated 1.0,2,2,??
Saajan Goel,Rated New place to hangout in town ... We were a group of 7 .. Wanting to chill around and have a good time. Moment we entered the place ... Found it really spacious and big. Ambiance is really nice ... Food is quite awesome both veg and non-veg. The only thing this place is service. I mean after getting seated nobody even came with the water. The orders were taking real time to be on table. Staff was .. I dont knw annoyed about something or wat. The didn't even had a smile on face. The place needs to improve on staff services .. Otherwise food was really good ... Hookah can be a little better. Seeing the place is just opened ... Draught Hoegarden wasn't available.. So thats kind a ok .. Overall looking forward to go again .. Expecting better service quality this time :),Rated 3.0,17,46,??
The Lonely Traveller,"Rated So i 've been a big follower of Priyank Sukhija's joints (he manages the best ONE'S in Delhi). I was deeply unsatisfied with this one. The food is good but the staff, from the entry till the exit, i didn't see a smile or a good gesture. It was more like they're doing a favour to us. I believe hospitality is all about making the customer feel good and obliged. The only reason i chose to visit this place was the name of the owner.I hope they actually train their staff on the ""gesture"" part. PS: The way they've done the place is amazing. You should visit this place once. *************************************PEACE*****************************************",Rated 1.0,44,67,??

Sidd.modernite,"Rated There are a million other better places than LOTD. has put in a lot of hard work in coming up with the place and it shows in the ambience, concept etc. But the service, the service is a piece of . I've never come quite close to losing my anger in the middle of a restaurant. The managers, and this sure guy are the most ignorant that you'd find around. They made my family of 4 sit on a table meant for 2 while groups of 3-4 people sat on lavishly laid out tables (apparently meant for 8-10 people). I won't go into the details of the actual bad service, all I'd say is- Go elsewhere, you'll burn less blood, you won't need to ""know the management"" to have a good night. The place is good and also, the management will make sure its shut down. To the managers, you for spoiling my Sunday night after weeks hard work.",Rated 1.0,1,0,??
Mayank Agarwal,"Rated Mesmerising Grandeur !! Huge huge huge and enchanting interiors. We were 14 and your service was like faster than our sound could travel.

But.. Pls be this way always.",Rated 5.0,1,0,??

Shaurya Gupta,"Rated We were a group of 8 people wanted to have some fun on Thursday night. But, I've gotta tell you it was surely ruined. We ordered some food in the beginning and it didn't come, after waiting for around 30 minutes, we called the manager and asked him. He called the waiter and he said there is no such order. The service was really slow. We were even getting a coke after 15-20 minutes and it was a week day. The waiters didnt know whats in the menu and whats not. We ordered the main course and they brought breads and paneer first and forgot to bring the Daal. The daal literally came after we were done having our dinner. Ambience was good though and the food was ok. But worst management I've ever seen. Surely won't visit and recommend this place to someone else. Thanks!",Rated 1.5,1,163,??
Simran Dhaliwal,"Rated One of the abandoned and isolated alleys of Cp outer circle will now be buzzing with life. With 18000 sq feet of space, Lord of the Drinks is ready to change the party scene in the heart of the city. Went a day after this placed opened. By now, have already heard and read a lot about it. Packed at 8pm. We were told there is a private party yet we were allowed. The sheer space that this place offers makes you feel good about it. We thought that the interiors arent doing justice to the name. It makes me feel a bit at Hybrid and a bit at Warehouse cafe. Yet its comfortable. We were given a table with a promise to leave in an hour but they took good 35 mins to take the order. Given it was day 2, most of the things we ordered werent available... no sangria, no black label 14 years, no tuborg, no Budweiser. Same goes for food. Honestly, we were little let down. Ideally, they should have kept a file menu for now like they have done at Hybrid. Why show it all when you arent ready to cater to it? Take your time. It takes time for things to settle down. Dont build high expectations if you arent prepared for it. We had to settle with Black dog, Mojito and red wine. All good. Ordered, Chicken Tikka pasta, Thai stir fry chicken, chicken dimsums and French fries. Again, decent but lacked the wow factor. The service was a letdown. People were in panic mode. Werent sure whats available and whats not. Can they let people in or is the place reserved. Dont know if the things were tizzy bcoz the man was on the floor, supervising the minutest thing. Will surely try this place again and also recommend a visit. What more, this place is rumoured to have a microbrewery.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Gaurav Dheer,"Rated This newly opened restaurant is situated in G Block, CP. Went there yesterday night for a good time and boy we were delighted. It transported us into an ambiance of good music and awesome time. The interiors are well done. The music is good, service is great. My picks from the menu would be lamb kebabs, mozzarella sticks and dragon roll. But the best part about this place is their super awesome yet affordable drinks. This place is really going to live upto its name and will provide you with a fantastic experience. Highly recommended!",Rated 5.0,1,26,??
Devyani Sharma,"Rated I went to this place yesterday and I had to write a review for it! I am in love with it and it has become my favourite place to go to in Delhi. Not only was the staff polite and courteous, the Food and the Drinks were fabulous. I ordered the chicken crostini and the chicken tikka to go with the Drinks. Me and my friend ordered loads of drinks and after that I must say, it really is THE LORD of the Drinks. This is the best place you'll find if you don't want the bill to go too heavy on your pocket. I was so surprised to find my bill to be so less because I had ordered alot! Their prices are unbelievable and when you sit in such a classy, rich ambience you are stokes I'm a fan and definitely recommend this place!",Rated 5.0,8,53,??
