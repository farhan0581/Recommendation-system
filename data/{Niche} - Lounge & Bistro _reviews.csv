Deep,Rated This potential strong lounge has all the right ingredients involved to become the best resto of CP. Very well decorated with a centre stage inviting live performances and a glass window ceiling offering day light during brunches. One should not miss their beautiful outer seating at the back. The drinks and food is very innovative. Must haves : Spinach and corn fettucini Tandoori spiced king prawns Jalapeo lamb burger Must have drinks : daisy and dillinger Service is great and this place is already on my list of personal favourites. Highly recommended ! !,Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Prateek Kithania,"Rated The food was very ordinary and didnt really appeal me.. Also, the decor is very ordinary the place seems very shady in the afternoon and there is no excellent ambience to justify the overpriced menu.. The place is nowhere as compared to other competitors in its vicinty.",Rated 2.0,4,45,??
Rahul Seth,Rated Went there for valentines Day dinner with wife. The host was wonderful got us a good table right next to the stage. There live music was wonderful and it completely fell we are sitting in some swanky restuarant in New York. Drinks- they have vast menu and good selection of wines but as per cocktails they have there only signature cocktails not the regular ones and I found them to be over priced at 1000/- per drink. So we went in for wine. Please improve on this and if u want to have only signature cocktails I think they should be decently priced. Food was just amazing we chicken tacos and beet&goat cheese salad. CT was okay but the salad was really good n light Main course we oredered smoked mushroom risotto n 62 chicken. Both the dishes were really good especially chicken- loved its presentation. Overall great experience and would definitely visit again.,Rated 4.5,3,30,??
Neelaakshi Piplani,"Rated Sunday Brunch with family on an open terrace OR Live Music and dinner with office colleagues on a Thursday night OR Saturday night clubbing plans. I am sure you must be wondering what am I trying to infer. Yes, you guessed it right..Head to {Niche}, a recently launched outlet in Connaught Place which is one stop for all of these and even more. It lives up to its name, and indeed is a {niche} be it ambiance, food or drinks!! The sheer sophistication is reflected as soon as you step inside the premise of the outlet, extremely thoughtful and soothing decor welcomes you. The royal plush seating in front of the colorful lively alphabets crafted wall under the transparent roof is the USP of the place. Loved it totally. The Sheeshas deserve a mention as they were extremely smooth and the flavor was evident in every drag. Do order the Commissioner as it will bound to leave you in an enticing state. The menu has been exclusively crafted and they specialize in the fusion of everything. The cocktail menu will leave you spellbound. Each and every cocktail is crafted with uttermost care and intricacies of the recipe is well taken care of. The presentation undoubtedly will blow you off your feet. My Favorites from the Niche Signatures menu- 1. Shrub Step- This extremely beautiful looking drink which comes in two sections is a mix of broad leaf vodka, balsamic shrub, mixed berry compote, basil, mint and citrus. This mixture is reduced and simmered for 72 hours so that the taste of the drink is enhanced and ultimately served in a vessel. 2. Daisy- Tequila based drink with a mix of organic chamomile honey, citrus, egg white and grapefruit bitters served in a classy cocktail glass along with a Marc Jacobs perfume bottle filled with second round of the same drink. These cocktails cost 1000 bucks but it is totally worth it, as just one sip ensures you enter in a state of euphoria. The innovation and hard work they have put in for crafting and serving these delicious drinks deserve a try Hokkaido is another fabulous cocktail on their menu, or rather an edible cocktail which has vodka panna cotta over Parle-G beach sand and citrus sea salt served over crushed ice. Wow!!! The food menu is impressive and every dish has been prepared and presented exclusively and resonates with the name of the outlet- {Niche} in every form. Recommended Starters- Pappu Chicken, Chicken Rice Paper Rolls, Mini Lamb Meat Pies, Bengali Fish Fry Sandwich, Parsi Chicken Burger, Panko Crusted Chillies, Chicken Arancini. The mains were equally relishing especially the Lamb Shank, Hari Saag, Spinach and Corn Fettuccini and Roasted Spring Chicken. And then the Chefs special dessert arrived Flexible Ganache which is one creative yummilicious dessert made of super soft chocolate, jaggery, jellies and macro pone cheese ensuring a happy ending to your meal. Shout out to Mathew who is the MD of the place and who consciously made efforts to introduce the concept and the hard work put behind crafting these delicacies. The manager Sashi was on top of the service and the servers Sandeep and Naresh were extremely cordial and smiling. Kudos people!! It is a slightly expensive place but totally worth the experience.

Deepak Aggarwal,Rated Went there on 14th Feb night with my wife. Nice ambience and live music. Average food. Quantity very less. But the most pathetic part was they took 50 minutes to prepare my bill. Just imagine after you have finished your dinner you have to wait for 50 minutes for the bill. One more thing was after I finished my dinner they took 20 minutes to clear my table. Pathetic service. Won't be going there again.,Rated 2.0,1,0,??

Gourmet Delhi,"Rated Ordered: Panko Crusted Chilies Chili Aam Papad Chilean Pork Ribs Lamb Ragu Spaghetti French Onion Soup Rings The first thing that draws you in is the ambience of the place- chic with a rustic charm, spacious and a fantastic terrace. The food and cocktails proved to be a breath of fresh air from the usual routine. Starting with the French Onion Soup Rings. The onion rings were crisp and even throughout. They had a thin slice of onion in the middle, which balanced the onion ring just right. They served as the perfect accompaniment with the soup, which was big on flavour. The pork in the pork ribs was tender and nicely seasoned. It was soft enough to fall apart on your fork. The real show-stealer though was the slightly sweet and tangy sauce served with it. The most lucrative part though was the extremely soft and moist dhokla to go with the ribs. Surprisingly, it went very well with the pork ribs and gave you a fresh taste in your mouth to sort of cleanse it before continuing with the dish. The Panko Crusted Chilies were lovely as well. Evenly batterrrd and fried, they served as an excellent appetizer. For main course, we went with Lamb Ragu Spaghetti. The lamb was seasoned perfectly and was very tender. The flavour wasn't overpowering but they weren't subtle either. This dish was fancy comfort food. The food at this lounge was pretty amazing and you should definitely visit this if you haven't already! @foodtalkindia @niche.lounge",Rated 4.5,2,0,??
Rahul Batra,"Rated Sometimes your day is very good and sometimes your day is amazing.. but sometimes your day is outstanding and that happens when you are able to find your niche. I had only heard about Indian Accent, never been there but i am sure Niche is the place which will not only compete with Indian accent but definitely beat them as well especially on value for money. Talking about its very famous cocktails which would only blast your mind and give you a pure alcoholic feel. Not even one can be ignored when it comes to being tried by an alcoholic. About the food They have carefully worked on their menu and selected the preparation of all them by heart. Let it be rich flavors of molecular dishes or the presentations, they have killed them all. Full marks goes to the service as well, even in the crowded and full place, they will manage to give you your order in your best interest. Overall i think i have found the best of the best fine dine place for myself in order to go on a date or even with some friends. Cheers... bragstreet.in",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Dhruv Aditya Mehta,"Rated Niche is probably one of the prettiest place I've seen yet! The interiors are quite literally the word 'niche'. The place is spanned to two floors with three terraces. Coming to the food, the food is modern world cuisine. I had the jalapeo lamb burger, Pappu chicken and the pulled kathal tacos. Each of these dishes surpassed each other. Extremely impressed with the food! Coming to the drinks now, they have an international mixologist Matt working with them. Seeing the cocktail menu I was overjoyed just reading about such ingredients in cocktails. I had shrub step which was vodka based and the cask of amontillado which was Hennessy based. I felt like I was having drinks at a michelin star restaurant in Paris. Overall excellent experience kudos to the management and owners for their effort and best of luck to them!",Rated 5.0,4,319,??

Sugandha Saxena,Rated I was invited by Food Talk India for the Sneak Peak of Niche newly opened place. The ambience was superb. It was a fine dining setting. The place has numerous variety of drinks and the cocktailsZ I started off with cocktails. The style of serving cocktails from presentation to ingredients were very latest and unique. It had a quite western touch to it. The bartenders were experts and professionals and know their job thoroughly. They also show cased some cocktails live at the bar. It was a good entertainment. The appetisers were great as well. However the emphasis was more drinks than food. For mains I ordered - Beetroot Salad - presented very well. Was appealing to the eyes but taste was ok. Mutton Shanks - ( Rogan Josh Gravy ) which were tender and soft and were presented in the westernised manner. Also tried mushroom Risotto- the flavour was good but still lacked a bit of seasons and was little undercook. There was another dish I tried was made with cottage cheese roll which was absolutely yum and Tender. Dessert - I had chocolate mousse with raspberry jelly squares. The presentation was good but tasted better. My overall experience was great. I would certainly recommend people to try out this place.

Manavv Piplani (Bribing Stomach),"Rated Niche- Class,Lavish,Premium etc. etc. Heard alot about this place from fellow bloggers and reviewers who had visited this place which made me more and more curious. So,when I got an invite from FoodTalkIndia for the exclusive launch, my excitement level was on cloud 9 and it was completely worth it. The place has been designed amazingly, the space has been perfectly utilized. The interiors are more of classy. The best part is there are two outside sitting which are completely opposite to each other(look wise). The front outside sitting is more like chilled out place and the backside sitting gives you an adventurous look sitting in the woods, as all the decor is done by the bamboo sticks. There were a variety of drinks, I had Dillinger, it's a vodka based cocktail with citrus, bay leaf and lots of crushed ice. I loved it as it wasn't that bitter. Honey mustard sour, it's a rum based cocktail with honeycomb syrup, egg white and citrus. It looked amazing as you can refer in the pictures. In food, Paneer Dum ka roll is basically sweet and sour paneer stuffed in small rolls with little gravy. Chicken Arancini it looked quite nice, in shape of small balls with some chicken filling. Tastes delicious. Lamb Shank, rogan josh with some vegetables is a nice combination and very tasty too. I loved it when accompanied with some breads. After Dinner (Desert) 1816 FILP it looked like 3 kind of ice cream scoops but it weren't. One tasted somethings like cranberry other one tasted like chocolate and caramel. I didn't get it but it looked & tasted amazing so I didn't bothered that much. Commissioner Sheesha was very refreshing and had an amazing flavour which was very smooth. The sheesha guy Krishan treated us with a smile though out as we called him many times for the coal thing. The service was fine according to the buzz. It was a FoodTalkIndia's event and it justified it completely. There manager Narender managed everything decently and Mukesh & Pankaj served us with joy and made the event worth attending. Overall a very lavish place to be, go try to find & experience your ""Niche"".",Rated 5.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Prayag Mukhi,"Rated This place does offer a variety a places to sit and enjoy your meal depending upon your mood. With two sided open galleries a spacious outlet in the middle on the 3rd floor, this place sure knows how to entice customers. This place does not dissappoint in any way possible. With great ambience and exceptional cocktails this place offers its own comfort which not may outlets in connaught place can offer. Now lets talk about the drinks: The cask of amontillado: made from campari, cardamom bitters and graprefuit bitters is one of the best cocktails I ve ever tasted and they serve it avery unqiue and interesting way and they also tell you the story behind it which I found very interesting. Daisy: Daisy- Chamomile Tequila and Grapefruit bitters served in a bottle makes it a delicious drink. Getting to the delicious food: Pulled pork tacos : served with smoked barbecue sause and sour cream is certainly the best tacos I've tasted in a long time. Prawn and cheese pakoda: served with wasabi malal espuma will leave a lingering a taste in your mouth. 57 degree Chicken Breast: gooseberry cuoslis, grape salad ,puffed rice and beeded chips is so smooth and lip smacking that it will keep you wanting for more.

Shweta Aggarwal,"Rated Connaught Place is one of the extensive hub for eating-houses in New Delhi, India. People get bored of Hauz Khas, Greater Kailash, Khan Market, etc. but CP is going to be their first love. CP is one location where one can enjoy food at any cost as it's a prime location for many street vendors and famous restaurants. Niche is a brand new concept in CP which will change the definition of Fine Dining. Spaced across two floors, Niche has a long bar with a live dessert counter (launching soon). Niche surprises you with its entrance, high-class leather furniture in brown, white, and black shades with dark brown color tables!!! Stylish cutlery and hookahs placed at the tables. A live performance stage, a huge glass through vault which makes Niche a romantic restaurant, a wall full of four lettered words which define the aura of Niche, walls have framed pics of legendary musicians, and what not... A FIREPLACE.... Can you beat that? Niche has two open terraces, front and the back side and soon they'll be launching one upstairs too. Niche has a limited menu so whatever you are gonna order will surely satiate your palate. Even the ewer has cucumber flavored water. The first five pages from drinks menu seem expensive but each cocktail is crafted from expensive ingredients and the portion size of some drinks serves two glasses. The introduction was Dillinger, dill infused vodka based drink with the freshness of bay leaf, sourness of other elements, and lots of crushed ice. Daisy stole my attention as it was poured into a perfume bottle, Chamomile Tequila with very subtle essences. Shrub Step is delectable with sweetness in every sip. Mr. Matthew Radalj showcased one of his delicacies - Sorbet Bellini, Pineapple and Thyme Sorbet submerged with Dom Pierre Perignon is an intriguing amalgamation. All of these signature cocktails were sampled with appetizing dishes. Initiated with Polenta, a Central European dish of boiled cornmeal was comforting. The Tomato Shorba was plated nicely and tasted hearty. French Onion Soup Rings, light snack rested on Onion soup, warm and thick. Rajma and Mushroom Galouti Quesadilla was a bit disappointing with unflavored kebab and rubbery tortillas. Beets and Goat Cheese is a colorful innovative salad. Hari Saag, Indians classic Makke Di Roti and Sarson Sa Saag was exhibited in the most contemporary way, a MUST HAVE for all the foodies. The main course ended with Smoked Mushroom Risotto, a little over-smoked for me but others loved it. Climaxed the meal on a sweet note - Panacotta topped with Ice Cream and decorated with fresh fruits. The combined effect of all the components gave a Happy Ending. Niche leaves you with a lifetime experience in terms of ambiance, hospitality, food, drinks and music. A special place for special occasions to create memories. thefoodiefling.blogspot.com",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Christina Peter,"Rated Niche graces CP with it's presence and with that ends the search of an actual Fine Dine in the vicinity. CP has over the past year completely been transformed and is now a hub of eateries. No matter where you look, either there is an existing restaurant or an ""Opening Soon"" signboard stares you into the face. Niche has entered the scene and would surely change the way CP looks at Fine Dining. Sprawled across two levels, Niche is as chic as it gets. The long bar alongside a live dessert counter (Yes, a LIVE Dessert counter!) is sure to catch your attention. Done in hues of Browns and Whites, this place exudes class. The seating is a comfortable mix of sofas and lounge chairs with a huge stage for live performances. What caught my fancy was the ceiling.. Niche has a see through glass for a ceiling and I'm already imagining how beautiful a rainy afternoon or a starry night would be here. Imagine, experiencing live music with delectable food and equally delicious alcohol and being able to enjoy the weather outside while completely avoiding the heat or cold. The outside seating is perfect for this weather, to grab a drink or to have some alone time with your loved one. Unlike most places these days, Niche doesn't have an elaborate menu which only means that you can be assured that whatever you order would not fail to impress you as it has undergone months and months of food trials! Drinks: Dillinger- This Welcome Drink is an absolute Party Starter. The vodka would soothe your throat and the ice would give the much needed punch.. Quite a Welcome I say! Daisy- Chamomile Tequila and Grapefruit bitters served in a bottle that resembles a luxury perfume is an idea that deserves a Huge Round of Applause and a Standing Ovation. Its so pretty...I wanted to bring it home. Shrub Step- Vodka, Balsamic Shrub, Mint and Basil. This makes for a delicious drink. Sorbet Bellini- Pineapple and Thyme Sorbet topped with Domm Pierre Perignon came highly recommended from the charming Mr. Mathew and no matter how much I thank him, its just not enough. The freshness of the pineapple against the bite of Thyme fixed with the fizz off Domm is a match made in Heaven! Food: French Onion Soup Rings- Crispy, light batter on juicy onions served on a bed of Onion soup is the perfect way to start a meal and that definitely sets the bar high.. Very HIGH. Vietnamese Prawns- Am a huge seafood lover, Prawns being ny absolute favorite. These were perfectly cooked juicy prawns set on a bed of tangy mango salsa.. Very refreshing. Chicken Arancini- Chicken Leg piece coated in a spicy sweet gravy, crispy skin and succulent insides would leave you craving for more. Hari Saag- Niche's take on the classic Saag and Make Ki roti. The saag is served with cottage cheese balls that are fried to perfection. The saag in itself is very flavorful and modern yet not interfering with the authentic flavors. A toasted bread replaces make Ki roti along with white butter. Its an absolute MUST HAVE! 62 degree Chicken Breast- Tender Chicken breast flavored with mace and cardamom butter. Its smooth as silk and the chicken is melt in the mouth. Dessert: Panacotta topped with Ice Cream and Fresh fruits. The subtle taste of panacotta against the tanginess of fresh fruits is the Perfect Climax to an Equally Perfect Meal. Head over to Niche for an experience that'll leave you rejuvenated. The staff is polite and happy to accommodate all your requests, participating in your nonsensical conversation, my fav staff member being Armaan.. Well done team Niche.. Counting days until you officially launch!",Rated 4.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Manav Sharma,"Rated My friends and I were visiting Connaught place (outer circle area) from Rajouri Garden last night and looking for a bar & Lounge to go to and we came across Niche - Lounge & Bistro and decided to check it out. The exterior of the building gave it a very excessive feel with one big wooden door that opened and closed. The interior was dimly lit and people were everywhere. The cocktails were very exquisite and unusual mixes and you could tell that the company put a lot of time into coming up with which ingredients to mix. I tried two different drinks that I can't remember the names of off the top of my head, but an ingredient in one of my drinks was a liquor that was exclusively made in California. I liked both of the drinks I tried, but I felt that the glasses were normal for the price of the drink. Overall, my friends and I had a good time at Niche - Lounge & Bistro.

I notice that this is really a growing trend around the city. The well polished experienced drink connoisseur that can do almost any trick with a shaker, a glass and a stirrer.
