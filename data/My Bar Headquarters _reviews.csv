Ajay Singh,"Rated One of the better My Bars. This place is pretty chick and not at all looks like a modal shop like a few other my bars. The place is really big, the seating is great. The island bar in the middle adds to the ambiance. The band playing live music was really good, these guys went on for hours without ever taking a break. Four of us went on a wednesday night and it was really packed. Finding a seat was not a problem though, the usher at the gate himself found us a seat, but the waiter kept on saying that we had taken an area meant for 6. I literally had to shout and scold him that we dint take the seat it was offered by his own guy. Really annoying. But thankfully things only went uphill from there.The service was surprisingly a mile better than what we are used to at My Bars. The food is way better as well.We ordered White sauce pasta, chilly chicken and chicken lollypops. The portions are decent. The pasta was better than average but short on seasonings, the chilly chicken was the best of the lot, The chicken lollypops were bad . Crispy alll right, but too dry and devoid of any flavours. The coating of batter was really thick. The beers were chilled. The cocktails were bad and way overpriced. We ordered chak de phatty and it was really bad. The place isnt very expensive, if you stick to beers you should be good for you. All in all , if you like a vibrant young ambiance go for it. This place is loud!",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Soyab Malik,Rated It's very crowdy and pathetic place. I did visit there I took group on packages. I was with my friends firstly they gave us all the drink together I said I will take one by one they said directly you will have to take together. I did request for d j they charged me 2000bucks extra it's a very big amount. It's very pathetic place.,Rated 1.0,2,3,??
Aanchal Bhasin,Rated Awesome Island bar..the place is just massive..terrace sitting in winter with the view of cp is something you just can't miss..food is just great and finger licking..ordered mediterrian pizza and dahi kebab..both were fresh and appetising! Ordered their Signature drink-MyBar Fresher..thumbs up to dat! Very affordable with a reasonable bill. Talking about the music..went on tuesday..they had great band ft. Perculssionist Vikki Mitta performing on bollywood tracks..house was full wid decent crowd..good hospitality! Overall the place is a must visit with friends!,Rated 4.5,2,31,??
Shubham Arora,Rated With amazing ambience and delicious food. This place is a must visit. The ambience over there sets up the mood. It is a place worth trying .,Rated 4.5,2,39,??
Aadi,"Rated As compared to other my bar branches, i must say that this my bar is far more better. The songs played are awesome. The place was crowded may b because it was a Sunday. The only problem i faced ws the delay in food and drinks. The waiters were so occupied that they almost forgot the order. The ratings i gave are because of the ambience. I liked the bar area.",Rated 3.5,16,12,??
Sahil Bansal,Rated Had been here 3 to 4 Times and every time was a different experience. It was great overall. the food and sheesha was good and worth. Price are reasonable. Just one point to improve on is the service should be improved. You to wait for long then the waiter comes. Overall recommended.,Rated 3.5,3,7,??
Pulkit Manchanda,"Rated Date of visit : 30th Jan 2016 So we started with some bira and orders French fries....... We had to return the fries as they were not good.... After 20mins they replaces the fries. The food was fine, the drinks where good. The bar tender dint know how to make good cocktails though, and they end up charging us soo much for the cocktails we asked them to make. It's a huge place with different sittings and all. So when we went in the evening the lighting was different, as it became night, the lights were dimmed and the ambiance changed. The staff is not good, the service is very poor. It's not cheap, for 5 ppl our bill was 12,000, and 2 out 5 don't even drink. Over all its an okay place to go...better than the other my bars in the neighborhood.",Rated 3.5,42,212,??
Aditya Sachdeva,"Rated You may have heard all the stories about my bar being a clich and a shady place? Well, My bar Headquarters defies them all. If you're in a mood for some drinks but not in a mood to spend a lot, then My Bar is the place to be. The food is satisfactory too. The ambience is like that of any other cafe you would see in the area.",Rated 4.5,4,38,??
Saloni Gupta,"Rated This place is never disappointing! From the music to the food to the drinks, everything is really amazing according to the price! The Pizza with a thin crunchy base and the huge Ak47 hukkah were the highlights!",Rated 4.5,0,38,??
Madhur Khatore,"Rated My Bar Headquarters is a great place with amazing ambience, live band performance, noisy fun crowd, et al. The food is good and so is the music. But there is one thing which really murders the experience here and that is the rude and arrogant way in which the waiters treat the customers. They don't smile or say even a single polite word! I asked for a glass of water, it was a little sticky so we asked our waiter to change it. Two mins later he comes back to our table, puts down or rather bangs down a tray with a bottle of water, glasses and a tub of ice, leaves the stuff on our table and walks away. That is not the type of behavior expected from someone who gives a damn about their customers! thefoodiebattle.wordpress.com",Rated 2.5,61,55,??
Mudit Paliwal,Rated A good place with quite amazing menu with nominal process...a great service gets slow when it is crowded on weekends but a great place to be with the squad,Rated 3.5,3,58,??
Shivendra Goel,"Rated Having been a My Bar Regular, Hq comes across as a welcome change to the entire MyBar chain. The interiors are very well done, with a huge seating area, island bar at the center and a pretty decent terrace. What makes me give this place a 2/5 rating is for the service alone. I visited there last month with 7 friends. It was a sunday night and the place was pretty packed but without any waiting we got a decent table for ourselves. Initially the servers were quick to bring in water and menu's but since we were a group of 8, ordering can be cumbersome at times. It took us around 8-10 mins to decide our orders only for the server to come after 30 mins to note it down. And an additional 1-1/2hrs. To get the 3 dishes in our order apart from the drinks whih itself took 20-30 mins to reach our table. At the end we had no other option but to leave our tables with empty stomach's to save us from this ordeal. NOT WORTH A VISIT",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Juhi,"Rated My bar opened a new and a very impressive space in CP named the my bar headquarters! The place is bigger, serves better food and has a lot better ambience than other my bars. We ordered a Pizza and a few drinks. It was a good experience.",Rated 3.5,142,378,??
Neha Khullar,"Rated I'll never recommend this outlet ever to anybody. Poor service, waiters literally look through you. I even overheard a waiter saying to the other 'isko plate dede yaar' when we politely requested for 3 quarter plates, I mean, really? Average time to change coal for hookah taken was 15 minutes. We ordered chilli chicken and Hakka noodles which were OK. Shall never step in, again.",Rated 1.0,4,13,??
Barun,"Rated Its really very nice place for hanging with friend , they have decent price and they don't have any happy hour. Its heavily crowded on weekend so its better you book the table in advance before going . They also have some open area for seating and you can enjoy the live DJ. They don't have any dance floor but there are some space near by DJ where you can move your body :) Improvement - they need to start draught beer asap .",Rated 4.0,4,1,??
Chandan Biswas,"Rated Well on budget and really a good place to chill with friends. Seeing lots and lots of people around, it feels really warm. Salads and starters were amazing. The chicken lollipop though, couldn't go up to the mark. But overall experience - I will surely visit the place whenever I am in Delhi next.",Rated 4.0,22,254,??
Siddhartha Kataki,"Rated I have been to this joint on two occasions during my brief stay in the city and on both occasions I had to leave disappointed due to one reason or another. Service is poor as the place is lacking in man power required during the peak hours. One needs to wait until someone comes to take your order and later on keep looking for the guy if you needed to order anything else. Hospitality is missing - one can see very few smiling faces among the staff. Like on the previous occasion, I was denied a tower of beer when I requested for it and surprisingly the reason behind remained the same - you need to wait indefinitely for it!! I felt very humiliated when one of the staff asked me to leave from the smoking room when I was half way through my cigarette which according to him can only be occupied by couples and the rest need to move to the terrace to smoke. I believe, if there are such kind of rules in place, then the same needs to be brought to notice by putting up signs easily visible to everyone or better put an end to smoking for all. That way nobody needs to feel discriminated or humiliated. Ironically, at least one person needs to be present at the table at all time - another 'rule' forced into place. So even if you are a couple and you feel the urge to smoke, you won't be able to go together and if you don't go together, you don't get to use the smoking room - now how brilliant is that?",Rated 2.0,15,26,??
Arpita Gautam,"Rated Amazing place, amazing music. I went to this place on new years eve and stayed there till the clock ticks 12. The place was full of fun. There was some sort of scheme going on so we got a cover of some price so we could order anything under that price, above that we will have to pay extra. While dancing , the staff also gave us whistles and mask and we enjoyed a lot. A must visit for cheap alcohol and amazing venue.",Rated 5.0,18,40,??
Namit Agrawal,"Rated We went here to celebrate a friend's birthday on a Tuesday evening. This place was packed even for a Tuesday night. 1. Ambiance is good. They have wooden flooring, large bar area and comfortable seating arrangement. They have TV screens playing sports channels all the time - something I personally prefer. Further, they have a separate smoking room which it makes convenient for us. 2. The place is decent on cleanliness. The tables get soggy with water and soda eventually and no one wipes it out and no one bothered to clean it for us. 3. Service is on the okayish side. We had to call out for the staff multiple times. Further, the staff is not vigilant enough to take orders, refill or clear the plates. 4. The starters were really good. Personally, I liked dahi kebabs and tandoori mushroom. - The place is affordable - Music is too loud - you barely get a conversation - Crowd is good here",Rated 3.5,69,116,??
Shayak Victor Munshi,"Rated Absolutely worse in terms of management and taking reservations.I wonder how your food and ambience will be if the handling is so poor.Last Saturday I called up for a place for 3 and there was a 30-45 mins waiting despite of having a telephonic booking.You guys are simply unprofessional,careless and mostly unmanaged staff who can't handle crowd specially on a weekend when people pour in like cats and dogs.I would never visit and neither recommend you guys to anyone.",Rated 1.0,39,274,??
Sahil Gulati,"Rated THIS PLACE IS HUGE, when I say huge, I mean very very huge. Having a capacity maybe for more than 100. Food - 4/5 (Quantity is less) Ambience - I visited it on the sufi night and it was amazing so 5/5 Service - 4/5 (Servers are a bit slow but very polite) Best of the 'MY BAR' category.",Rated 4.0,35,60,??
Sur B,Rated Pocket friendly restaurant n bar.it serves nice decent Chinese snacks with varieties of flavoured sheesha. The place is a bit restricted. The food is fine and ambience is also decent.,Rated 3.5,16,24,??
Aniket,"Rated We were looking for place with good music and ambience. My Bar has it all. This place is huge. No offers on drinks even on weekdays. The lady at the entrance was kind enough to give us a table immediately. We ordered for few drinks, paneer and chicken. Vegetarian dish took ages to be served. Taste was good. The worst part was that all the glasses were stinking. In spite of bringing this to the notice of the waiters and captain, we got stinking replacement glasses. This is not acceptable for a standard restaurant and that too with high menu prices.",Rated 2.5,54,73,??
Jitesh Foodaholic,Rated So Every1 is aware I think bout this My Bar But just in my kind of Review the ambience was OK OK But as I was in mood for Sheesha I ordered their Special AK 47 and really I loved the Hookah Bcoz of Battery failure couldn't click the pic But it was awesome made nd the service much better though it was Tuesday but still this kind of service is must for Hookah lovers So the Food was not so delicious in my accordance but as I always say that every chef has its own Flavour so no Regrets for that. Lastly Bar price is cool as per CP so do visit,Rated 3.0,13,57,??

Neha Bhise,"Rated Absolutely fun place to go..ended up here on a weekend after we were refused entry in a nearby pub due to a friend's small kid. However it turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to us to kickstart the weekend.

Suparna Roy,"Rated Great place to come on Friday nights and during weekends. the first time we went to this place was during one of the weekends last month. It is a good place to hangout if you like loud music,affordable booze and exquisite hookah. It is a crowded place specially during weekends. The ambiance and the staff is good but the food is ok. It's a very busy and crowded place so you may have to wait in queue sometimes to get in. Note: Guys!! If you are going to have dinner there then let me tell you its not an ideal place to go for dinner but an awesome place to hangout.. Cheers!!...",Rated 4.5,18,69,??
Moody Blus,"Rated A great place for having a get-together with friends and colleagues.

Manavv Piplani (Bribing Stomach),"Rated 3rd August, I visited this place with 3 of my friends, We took bar chairs and placed the order of our hookha,drinks and food. Hookha took like forever to come but arrived,it sucked. A couple of beers were on our table in no time but no waiter bothered to open it up for us. And in food we ordered, Chilli Chicken with Hakka Noodles and Fresh Garden Pizza. But guess what,it never arrived. Our food never came to us, When we inquired about it,the waiter said you guys switched the table,so your order got cancelled. Nobody even bother to inform us. I went out straight away. Everybody deserves a 2nd chance,right? So,on 16th November I visited their again when this friend convinced me to give it another shot. Still the same, Waiter wasn't bothered to take our order, After 15-20mins waiter arrived, We ordered a pan cigar hookha,chilli chicken and they didn't had breezers (okay,happens),they didn't had Ice tea (Are you kidding me). Atlast they had virgin mojito and she ordered cranberry juice. Pan cigar hookha sucked on every level, Chilli chicken was stale and wasn't even edible. Virgin mojito wasn't even blended properly and cranberry juice was mixed with water(can you beat that) I payed 2k for this shit. I regret it on every level! There's no lower rating than 1 otherwise I would have given that. Disappointed,Very Highly DISAPPOINTED! Going there is a mere waste of time.",Rated 1.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Nitesh Mohan Bansal,"Rated Hi. My review for this place is very much common that this is a good place to drink n eat. Normal menu, ambience and ok service But i have a question the management. I have been to this place few times. Despite paying 10 percent service charge on everything we order why the hell your service staff ask for tips??? Despite having not so world class service. If you really want your guys to be paid tips. U can add one more component to the bill as ""Mandatory Tip"" or anything instead of asking the customer for it in the end.",Rated 1.0,8,37,??
The Varun Kapoor,"Rated ITNE PAISE MEIN ITNA HI MILEGA Went to this place tonight, 4th Feb 2016. Ordered Dahi ke kebab, Chilly Chicken, Shawarma roll with fresh lime soda(mixed) and Old Monk Large in hot water. THE GOOD (Not so good though) 1. Dahi ke Kebab were tasty but the plating was shabby and kebabs were almost room temperature. THE BAD 1. When I asked for Old monk with hot water, I was refused to be served hot water because it was ""Company policy"" to not serve hot water. Had to talk to the manager to get hot water. 2. The mixed fresh lime soda was extra tangy and hence we asked for some sugar syrup. What we got was 3 sachets of mouth freshener. 3. Shawarma roll was chicken chunks instead of shredded chicken. And hummus had a peculiar taste. Perhaps not cooked properly. 4. When I gave my credit card to pay the bill, I was made to go to the counter to punch the pin instead of the service staff bringing the machine to the table. Because going for walk after meals is good ;-p. I was told at the counter that ""yahin pe punch hoga, table par nahi jaegi machine"". And trust me the tone was demeaning and rude. 5. ""Icing on the cake"" was when we were prevented from using elevators to go downstairs because the guard said that the lift won't go down. ""It can just bring you upstairs."" It was tough to be polite after all this, but I just felt pity for the manager who also seemed quite pissed off with the behaviour of his staff and we left the place. Anyways, strongly suggest anyone against going to this place. Very discourteous staff and food isn't their speciality.",Rated 1.0,12,40,??
Always.people.lie,Rated Came on a Thursday for their live band. The drinks were good the band was a bit too loud for such a small place and the food so so. It's a good place to relax with a good drink,Rated 4.0,5,6,??
Aditi Sarao,Rated A groovy atmosphere along with a great setup awaits you at this place. Brimming with people and buzz it surely makes for a nice evening outing. The drinks and food preparations are similar to the other My Bar outlets or slightly better if I could say. The hookah is well made with some great flavours in the tow. However this place is more about just letting your hair down and enjoying an evening than binging on food. So head out to this place to shake a leg while you indulge in some amount of food/drinks inebriation :),Rated 3.5,62,173,??

Keshavsinghal25,"Rated The vibe at this place is always fun and enjoyable but they have ill-mannered staff. They'll keep asking you, interrupting your conversations repeatedly, whether you want to order something or not.. and once you make it clear that you don't want to order anything else, they'll immediately come up with the bill. The waiters will keep on asking you to pay the bill while you're still having your food and drinks. The waiters keep looking at you, and if you go there with a female friend then I feel sorry for you. Yes, surely the place offers inexpensive alcohol but then it all comes at a cost and at MyBar Headquarters it comes at the cost of ill-mannered staff and a horrible party experience with your friends.",Rated 1.5,4,1,??
Suhael Buttan,"Rated The place is huge unlike other my bar branches and it's also the best one among the other branches. Living Upto its reputation , the prices of both food and alcohol is quite cheap. I've now been here 4-5 times and I've thoroughly enjoyed every time. The music played is a mix of Bollywood, edm and other genres. Coming to the food , I've tried their chicken tikka , chilly chicken and salami. Their chicken tikka is lip smacking. The tikkas are huge and is really juicy and tender. Chilly chicken and salami are nice too. Besides this I always order a bowl of chips which is served with sweet chilly and mayo. The fries are nicely done and papad. As far as drinks are concerned, I've never tried their cocktails. I just stick to the normal whiskey am beer combination. The rates need no introduction , they're quite reasonable. Perfect place to chill.",Rated 4.0,29,128,??

Lets come to the music...the DJ was half the time not available to take any kind of request...one should tell him that just because a song is english, that does not mean that it is a good party song...and when the songs were being changed, the transition was pathetic...in short..the DJ and the staff just ruined whatever mood we were in to have some fun... last but not the least..the way our order was served..no ice cubes/soda/cold drink with our drinks. Why you would ask....because it was not mentioned specifically..!! woah..!! now that was a first.!!

Davashish Srivastava,"Rated Quite a spacious bar and lounge, extremely packed on Christmas as was expected. Owners and senior managers are courteous and other service staff is least bothered and even too Casual in their behaviour. Food offered is just above average, liquor is not so costly. Crowd is mostly 'just out of college' or 'let's celebrate 1st job change' or 'can I buy you a drink' types, with a few exceptions as well. The place buzzes quite fine and is not a bad hangout if a.

Priyank Agrawal,"Rated Every time I enter a 'My Bar', I ask myself - Why? One and single USP - Lowest alcohol prices My Bar Headquarters makes up where other My Bars lack...in space and in crowd. Food is not good here at all and I'd recommend maybe the pasta and some Chinese. Keep to the salted peanuts and chakhna if you can. As for the drinks, LIIT is always pretty good here, better than most other places. On this particular visit, the hookah was also no good. The waiter who served us did not even know what dish was he carrying in his tray!

Although they provide a wide variety of beers at nominal rates, you would usually be offered only kingfisher.. And no draught beer... That was crazy... Its there in the menu, we ordered a tower and its not available.. They provide hookah at nominal rates, but that too was pathetic.. They should really improve in hookah preparation... Food was average in terms of quantity and flavor... Even after all this, the worst part is their service... Very slow and not at all concerned about the people they are entertaining... we had to wait 10 mins for our order to be taken... 20 mins to get the hookah's coal replaced and 5 mins for an extra spoon... which should have been there in the first place...

The biggest USP of My Bar chain of restaurants is the price tag which is pretty good and this is the reason you have to wait for seating on a Tuesday evening at 8.

Pragya Khera,"Rated This place actually let me down and not once, but twice. Hence, this review today. The service, quality of ambience has considerably fallen down. I went with 2 friends and the service was really slow today even though we had ordered just one starter at one time. We got it after 25 minutes. We decided to move on and enjoy as the starter i.e chicken lollipop tasted amazing. The cocktails were also nice. Because we were satisfied with the taste of whatever we had ordered till now, we ordered more - chilli chicken(gravy) and chilli garlic noodles. But to our utter disappointment, chilli chicken was excessively spicy. I love spicy food but I have never had such spicy chinese ever. The music was really loud still the atmosphere was low on energy. Slow service and lack of attention from the waiters added to the irritation. I have never had such a bad experience with my bar headquarters till now. I think I will visit after sometime now and see if it has come out of this deep slumber or not :P buck up guys! You can still hold on to the awesomee brand name. These 3 stars are only because my bar still remains an easily accessible fun hangout place in Delhi and I have had awesome fun here before.

Vishi Khandelwal - EnticingFoodCruise,"Rated The name My Bar Headquarters sounds like another level, but its nothing but a bigger and more spacious place for the people to chit-chat and enjoy over drinks and taste some bit of food too. The place has a huge floor with comfortable seating and an open air rooftop overlooking the lovely Connaught Place. The inside area is all lit with red/orange lighting accompanied with load music. As soon as you enter you will see the entire place hustling bustling with servers moving all around the place and people laughing, talking on the toppest of their tones (just to be audible in the load music), friends cheering with drinks in their hands and some enjoying the hookah. The open air rooftop is on the flip side an all chilled out seating with light music playing and ideal place to spend the night drinking underneath the stars. Hence we decided to stay outdoors and sat down to order drinks first. A special mention that the servers were pretty decent in providing the menu right after we sat down and noted down our order for Corona and Carlsberg. Since they were out of stock with Corona, they got all Carlsberg for us. Grabbing our stomach out of hunger, we decided to order for Cheesey Nachos which was very less in terms of quantity and average in terms of quality. The Nachos were topped with Jalapeno and Olives along with Chesse. The salsa dip provided along was average too. Masala Peanuts Wonderful, served with onion, capsicum, tomato and some lemon juice was just the perfect combination. Paneer Tikka Tasted good, paneer was tender and fresh Paneer Pakoda Perfect chilly evening and an open terrace, what better than have a plate full of steaming hot and fresh paneer pakoda. Served along with green chutney, they were the shop stopper for sure Chilli Potato Chilli Potato was very crispy and aptly cooked. Just perfect for the occasion Tandoori Mushroom The mushrooms were tasty and good. Tasted average, noting great and much to criticize about them Amongst the beer and the finger foods, I also had a guava based Mocktail which was average again. We looked out for having hookah, but the hotel staff tried to act smart by declining the small hookahs and then offering us the medium and large hookah and then later on found out that we only have an option to order the large one. Hence, we decided to give it a miss. Get your bookings in advance, because this place remains packed on the weekends and holidays. Expect waiting time to easy be 20 min plus during peak hours if you did not get the bookings. The food is average 3/5 The ambience and the open-air is sitting is good 3.5/5 Value for money 5/5 I would rate the place an overall 3.5 considering it to be a drinking place which serves and caters to young crowd and works on the USP of serving cheap alcohol and does not master in area of delicious food servings. If you are looking for good food and alcohol please give this place a miss, but if you are struggling with your monthly budgets and want to enjoy alcohol and good time with friends get your bookings and hit the place. We saw the food winking, smiling and alluring us but then we have to leave just to come back with more experiences from our EnticingFoodCruise",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Shubhit Kumar Gulati,"Rated Now, I don't drink or smoke, but I do enjoy the company of my dear friends. Thus, after hours of thinking about which place is spacious enough to accomodate 15 people on the go, we finally decided to climb up multiple fights of stairs to reach a timid little entrance way which opened up to a MASSIVE hall-esque place with neon boards hosting brand names and a dark EDM theme to the entire place. Although we had to wait outside, on the balcony to be seated, but that made for a perfect view of Connaught Place. Finally, when we were seated, we were greeted by the bright smile of the waiter. BUT THE ONE THING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IS WHY DO PEOPLE ORDER FREAKIN CHILI POTATOES EVERY WHERE? Bhai, yeh sab gali ke bahar wale bhaiya 50 mei dete hai. If you're out someplace special, try their speciality. Anyway, we got some snacks and multiple chili potatoes and a pitcher of beer. NICE. For a non-drinker, seeing them put this big-ass cylinder of beer WITH a TAP and some mugs. MIND=BLOWN. Cmon, I've never seen such futuristic technology, cut me some slack. The food was great and the drinks, I think, were refreshing? Alcoholic? Enjoyable? I don't know. Something along the same line. The crowd was fun too!

Yajur Mahendru,"Rated I had gone to this place with few of my friends on a Saturday night. We had to wait for 10 minutes to get a seat on the second floor. The space has a large seating space with really good music playing around. I really loved the ambiance and the setup. Within starters we got ourselves Chicken Salami, Vegetarian Kebab Platter and Chilly Chicken. The food really tasted really nice except the chilly chicken which we had to return due to pungent smell depicting unfreshness. The staff was kind enough to replace the dish with a fresh one. Within drinks, we had LIIT and Beer jar. We had also ordered a mint hukkah which was just okayish. Overall a really nice place to be which I would surely recommend all. Only suggestion to the management would be to slightly speed up the services.",Rated 3.5,175,318,??

The ambiance was decent enough and the chilly Delhi winter made the experience even better. We had ordered a portion of Chilli Chicken first and it tasted amazingly delicious. Then came the hookah along with chilled beers and the hookah was good enough. For each hookah they provide two complimentary coal changes.

When we reached we still had to wait 20 min and then they got us a table in the smoking section which sucked as hell and took another 20 min to change again. The waiters need to learn some manners as they don't know how to behave or talk to their customers. Hookah took almost 45min to come and even after that they took 15-20 min to get the smoke right. They were serving us with 2 dishes of everything we ordered, clearly the management is poor and needs a lot of improvement. I suggest you not to go to such cheap places.",Rated 1.5,1,6,??

It's mostly famous due to cheap alcohol. It's the place to go for the people who have a great capacity since the drinks are very reasonably priced. The music is very loud at times. However, many times a lot of things on the menu might not be available. The food is average. I liked the pasta here.

Jayantika Sarwal,"Rated Being my second visit to this place, I was really pepped up and looking forward to this evening here.. Luckily, there was a live performance of fusion music going to start soon. So, smiling faces of ours went inside and occupied our already reserved table. The person came and took our order. We were quick enough to decide what we wanted. I placed the food order.. The FOOD included : 3/5 1. VEG KEBAB PLATTER An assortment of veg hara bhara kebab, roasted mushrooms, paneer tikkas and galouti kebabs. It was a filling meal. Everything was nicely cooked and blended well with the spices. 2. DRY VEG MANCHURIAN This again turned out to be a good option to be ordered. Though it didn't look freshly cooked, but it tasted nice. 3. VEG PENNE IN CREAM SAUCE It was totally pathetic.. Hardly any sauce, some small portions of it which was present there was actually so thick that it coated the pasta like a woollen blanket. The salt measures was so high in the dish, that anyone's BP would go up right after eating it. 4. PANEER TIKKA I personally am not very fond of paneer, but still tasted a piece, and it was as tender as it should've been. 5. VEG HAKKA NOODLES Moderately okay. Not very appealing.. The DRINKS included : 1. COSMOPOLITON The usual concoction of vodka and cranberry juice. Didn't appeal to me much. Considering this place is a hot shot and we known for its liquor and drinks, I have had better cocktails. 2. VIRGIN MOJITO Good. Fresh, and refreshing! Coming to the AMBIANCE : 3/5 This place has a huge layout. Like literally sprawling over a very large area. Everywhere one could see only heads, as distant as your eye sight could catch the view. Dim lit, a bit congested, but you can surely grab a good spot to sit if you're lucky enough to find it. The SERVICE : 1/5 Absolutely disappointed. To an extent, can't even fathom in words. - Firstly, one had to constantly keep calling the servers to make them clean the table. All of them were in so much haste, that no one bothered to clear the table, put the cutlery right and provide with the right dishes that were ordered. - The servers were unaware of the fact which table placed which order. We got 3 people coming and asking if the food in their hands we're ordered by us or not. - The pasta as mentioned above was very salty.. We tried to chew it putting in a lot of seasonings, thinking it might taste okay after that. But to our disappointment it didn't. After telling one of the servers about the same, we were asked as to what shall they do now about it. Nothing can be done about it, as we had eaten few spoons. He asked me directly if he shall take it away from the table. Such mannerism was not expected at all. - Lastly, we ordered a beer tower. Because the server had to place that tower on the adjacent table who had just occupied their seats, he forcefully filled everyone's glasses on our tables. Constantly telling him to not do so, the glasses were forcefully made to overflow. I had hoped a much enticing experience, but to much disappointment it wasn't. I don't know if I'd like to visit this place again considering what we faced this time. Can't find a way to end this review, so I'd have to end it simply saying - ' Service, for me plays a prime role if I'm dining out. If anyone can overlook that part and carry on with the place, one can give it a try ' Bon appetite!",Rated 3.0,58,546,??
Rishabh Furtado,"Rated As ironic as it could be, at 21, I drink occasionally. But my friends need a damn reason to get their hands on the bottle. And the only place they would suggest, is this. Looking at the hype of the so called ""reasonable bar"", it does have good deals to offer. My friend and I started off with Old monk, Heineken Tower, two plates of Chicken Lollipop, ending with Jagger bomb. At 3k, it felt a bit choking, but the ambience was something to really appreciate as the environment to have booze had actually raised its standards. A place for people to have booze with barbeque dishes, but the taxes wont let you call it reasonable again.",Rated 3.0,29,58,??

Harman Narang,"Rated Went here with my cousin .As ironic as it may sound we both don't drink but still went there. It's jam packed at late evenings. Had to wait for half an hour as we were 'STAGS'. So couples get entry a lot quicker here. There is a separate section for couples and ladies. The arena is too loud. Don't go here to have a proper conversation . You need to shout to talk. We ordered Chilli chicken - upto the mark. Chicken Tikka -The tikka was good , hari chutney they served along was delicious. Shawarma Rolls are recommended .They come with absolutely ass kicking dips. For drinks we had Virgin Colada and Virgin Mojito :( The drinks had to be good. The service was quick considering how crowded the place was.Our bill was around 1650.

Akhil Gupta,"Rated *Brownie points for Sheesha* My Bars officially have the cult status in Delhi and they are really amazing. I guess My Bar Headquarters is the flagship restaurant. It is very spacious, spic and span clean with very well dressed stewards. My experience was amazing, like any other place, two bachelors entering a family pub is frowned upon. We were directed to a corner which was at the farthest corner from the ""couple"" area. Apart from this tiny experience, I had a great time. I spent around 4 hours there and it was some quality fun with friends. The service is a bit slow, but it is fine. The food is kinda fine, but then the drinks are cheap and merry. I would still prefer Paharganj My Bar over the headquarters, unless I am seated at the ""Couples Section"" with bae! ;)",Rated 3.5,80,362,??
Shilpa Chauhan,Rated Nothing special about this place... It's like any other mybar... The only thing which is different is just that the place is huge... But that's it!!

The seating here is dichotomized into terrace and in house. Terrace area is not that big but it's good if you want to enjoy weather and want to chit chat with your friends. The in house seating area is so huge. We ordered Mediterranean pizza and My Bar farm fresh pizza, white sauce pasta and few drinks. These were thin crust pizzas and they were realllyyyy goood. Pasta was average. The service was okay but it needs to be better in terms of quality also. Staff was good. DJ was amazing and he played really good music. Though it's a crowded place but it was fun to be there. The ambiance was good. So in all it's a really nice place to party and to hang out with friends. Value for money.

We ordered: -chicken lollipop- reallyy good -honey chilli potato- average -Lemon chicken- good -paneer tikka- good The options of beer was soo limited. They had all the famous beer on their menu but all they had was kingfisher, amstel and mahua which was really disappointing. Since We were a huge group we didnt bother and ordered a large number of kingfisher ultra beer bottles and mojitos and started to enjoy and dance. But in no time these weird cocky staff people barged in and stopped us saying that we re not allowed to dance there. It was really insulting and unexpected as we had danced earlier in other branches of my bar. Sadly, they have just crowded the massive place with unlimited number of tables and chairs, leaving absolutely no space for dancing. And then if we don't dance, we talk, but due to such loud music we couldn't even do that. All these things made the place suck big time despite the good lighting, the otherwise good ambiance and super budget friendliness. I would have looved the place if the management people/staff wasn't so stuck up and uncool!!!",Rated 2.5,25,10,??

The ambience is really cool in its own way and a huge area covered ( I must say its a big club after all its the HEADQUARTERS ). Pricing for the serves and service is pretty good, one of my friend was served with a mojito & she didn't liked the taste of the drink and i must say her drink was instantly swapped with the perfectly right drink in a few moment of seconds and I loved this part ( impressive ) of such clubs having crowd like hell (moreover there were some stags, groups and even couples standing in the queue) Thank god!

The ambience could have been a little better, but still their music system is really good and the place is quite lively. The selection of music was also quite good. However, it's extremely loud which makes it difficult to talk, especially with most of their table arrangements. To drink, I tried their Virgin Mojito, which was excessively sweet, and not as refreshing s they're supposed to be. To eat, I tried their Chicken Lollipop (which was nice), and their Chicken Shawarma Roll (which was quite bad and overpriced for its kind).Also, the French Fries were also so-so.

When we landed there, the place was pretty full, still we managed to get a place for the 3 of us. I won't say the waiters are very polite or courteous but they are friendly and keep you entertained.

Eat Style Shop,"Rated To begin with, I am not quite a fan of the chain of restaurants this group has. I like my restaurant are to be a little calm and quite, and this doesn't quite do that for me. But yes, cheap alcohol is how they advertised themselves, and I must admit, they have lived up to it. So, on a similar day when my pocket wasn't as friendly as it should have been, my friends and I decided it was time to go to My Bar and have alcohol that only lightened our hearts, not pockets. For starters, I area of this My bar is HUGE. It's overwhelming to see the area these guys have gotten in a place like CP. When you enter, you can easily make out that this place is definitely for college students and basically for anyone who wants to get 'high'. The ambiance of the restaurant pretty much screams that at you. We ordered the usual, a good round of drinks. Right from Vodka shots- which btw seem to me as though I was consuming poison and totally not like vodka. Coming down tot cocktails, I ordered a Cosmopolitan- a drink almost every bar in Delhi can mix well. I was so disappointed after tasting the dish. It was a foul smell, and felt like there was no flavour. We also ordered a veg pizza, hakka noodles or something of that sort and nothing tasted right. Everything was off, it was either too salty or too bland. Case in point, the pizza was too sour and I felt like the tomato sauce used wasn't fresh. Same is the case with the noodles, they had no real flavour in them. I have never gone back to the place again and I am hoping I don't have to. Up until they raise their service.",Rated 2.5,20,5,??

Mohit,"Rated My Bar Headquarters has definitely got the size of a headquarter. It's huge. There is so much space to sit, it almost feels like a canteen. The similarity ends here though. The ambience is like a typical bar with wooden furniture, loud music (sometimes subtle though), non-plastered walls, exposed iron stuff and dim lighting. It has got a good vibe to it and its location (Cannaught Place) is a plus point too. There is also a sofa-like seating but in a little space though it's a lot more comfortable than wooden chairs. The washroom is clean and nice. But what makes My Bar different from a plethora of pubs and bars in the area? It's the killer pricing of the food and booze that is the USP of this place. It's pretty light on the pocket. Considering the good ambience and the location of this place, it's a steal. Do make sure to reserve a table, especially if you are planning to go on a weekend. We tried a Pizza (don't remember the flavor); it was great - thin-crust base with nice melting cheese. Chilli Chicken didn't actually look or taste like one but whatever it was, it was yummy.

As soon as we moved there a waiter came to us and asked us to move to two seater as he said those are ""couple table"". We said these are all empty we will move if anyone comes, we just came from a heavy day and wanted to relax for an hour but he kept on insisting on us moving to those ""couple table"", I was so annoyed with that guy's behavior and calling us ""couple"", that if it was not for my friend I would have slapped that guy ! we did move to those stupid uncomfortable chairs but as my mood was already off and I realised that if this is how they behave with their customers, there is no point in wasting my time.

Since I liked the interiors most I will talk about it first. Ambiance - 4/5 As I said this place is gigantic. The bartenders tables are located perfectly at the center of the pub with chairs alongside with it. You can enjoy your drink and can order directly from the bartender. If you want to sit and relax on couch you can sit on the corners. This place can accommodate around 100 people without being looking crowded I guess. We can seen a uniquely prepared stage in it where live bands can play. Music that was being played at the time we went was just okay. it could have been better. They played just loud rock music. Interiors are nice and lighting is also perfect as it should be in a club. Service - 1/5 Now that was a big big concern for us. Our order was not served on time. It was delayed by almost 30 mins. This wasn't enough for them. They even brought wrong dish for us. When we ordered veg cheese steak. They brought non veg steak. It was very disappointing. We had to literary run after the servers to bring our order. When the place is so big you need to have more attendants. I could not understand how an order of single bottle to beer can take 30 mins to come. Service was a setback. Food - 3/5 We ordered Chakna Platter, Chily Paneer, Cottage Cheese Steak, Chicken Seekh Role, Paneer Kathi Roll, Fresh garden Pizza, Lemon Chicken. All the dishes were nice and tasted well except lemon chicken. It was very salty. I had lemon chicken for the first time and probably after having it, it could be the last time :(. I really liken the thin crust pizza. It was crisp and delectable. A special mention will go My bar refresher drink. It was lovely. Value for money - 4/5 I seriously doubt that you can find more cheap place whole of Connaught place of this kind. Cost per person would be around 800 without drinks. If you want to enjoy and relax with your friends without spending too much you can give a visit to this place. I hope My bar hq increase their service levels.

Rahul.seth149,"Rated To me, the place did not impress at all. You initially get enthralled with the idea of paying less for the booze, for the way it is marketed when you enter the place. But that's just a sham. So it needs to be ignored. While their punchline says it's happy hour every hour, they don't have any kind of happy hour from Friday to Sunday at any hour. Atleast that's what my waiter told me happily, that surprised me, that their heavily-marketed claims are not really genuine ones. To add to the irony, the food was lousy. Ordered Fish fingers and chicken pepper and salt but they were raw and did not taste good at all. Another unpleasant discovery was that while it says the wifi is available ( as per Zomato info), it is actually not. They refused to share the password and said that the manager does not share the password with anyone. I would request Zomato's content team to edit the info here. The wifi is not available to the customers at MBH. While they say their beer rates start from Rs 85, they, in reality, keep in stock, only the expensive ones so that you end up paying more, once you have fallen prey to their stupid claims. Another part of the sham they have put up around the price. Shameful. The place sucks big time and it was a lousy experience, not surprising though for me, as I experience the missing service-orientation aspect in most of the places in Delhi, which claim to be big and awesome but actually are hollow from inside.",Rated 1.5,4,0,??

Niharika Singh,"Rated Alright now it is really sad to have come down to a situation like this . Sunday last week i and me a group of friends visited My bar headquarters its in N block a few shops ahead Dunkin . Ambience : for 1 pm it was pretty good . The crowd turns up that definitely looked like it also the music, interior everything seemed alive and really engaging . I kind of liked it . Nothing out of the world but definitely more than average 3.5/5 Staff : i am specially mentioning staff because this is where i seriously couldnt stand the place and didn't get why were they even there . Planely dumb barely knew anythibg about their own menu and had no coordination among themselves . I had to repeatedly keep asking them to do things ( even to clean up the tables ) . I had asked for their assistance for the menu and the poor girl kept asking her seniors assistance to help us with the menu because it looked like she was new and wasn't aware of the job she was doing and she kept telling hun to guude her but that thick skinned monkey yet didnt pay any heed to her . Then i tried reaching out to him in person but the monkey just kept saying YES to every question i had . Finally i gave in n ordered regular safe things rather than trying anything new . I am writing in here in order to not to criticize an experience it defntly was a good one at that but if a review helps the management understand where they r going wrong then y not? . Also the sheesha was reallly sad . We ordered kiwi mint flavour and man i make better than that . I regretted payingg 650 bucks for it . Food : (non veg) chilly chicken - 2/5 most of us were veg so we ordered two veg starters n one non veg . Non veg wasnt really great . Nothing great very okayish . Just digestable . ( Veg )- i must mention that was indeed the best vegetable salt n pepper i had . Perfectly cooked and each ingredient added to it had its own essence 4.5/5 ( there is always toom for more ) Chilly mushrooms were again commendable n because i am a mushroom fan i totally loved it i would have gone all crazy if the mushrooms weren't cooked right so again blessed us . Butter chicken was again okayish . N so was there noodles . Drinks : booze is cheap and that explains a large turnout i presume . Italian smooch was too sweet towards the end i suggest u low down a bit on the sugar but tasted fine . Overall : my bar is a good place to hangout if u wanna stop buy to maybe just have a drink or two n chat n maybe munch on to something however if u turn up to plan a day out and splly come here sit for hours and laugh n date i suggest pick a better place until the management works on it seriously . easy for the pocket good music happy drinking .

Rajiv Kumar Sharma,"Rated I have been to My Bar Headquarters a couple of times including my most recent visit. First time I went there, I was pissed off with the service and the turn around time at The Vault, and My Bar was an option to my delight. Everything was good, the interiors were super, the music and the ambiance was great, good crowd and the drinks, food, the sheeshah, everything was just what is needed to make your evening with friends perfect. But my most recent visit spoiled all the good work done. I went there with my group of friends and being there on a Saturday night, we were expecting to have a waiting period. But when we were called, we were told that as of now there is only a table available in the smoking room, which in facts looks like an area inside My Bar Headquarters reserved for the undeserved (more of a desi theka). The place was kinda separate from the main area. Still, we agreed but requested the manager and the waiters around to let us know if a place becomes available in the main bar area and we can be shifted, which they agreed to. We thought of ordering something for the time being. First of all, it took someone about 20 minutes to attend to us and take orders. We asked them to get us the guy who takes orders for sheeshas and we will place order for food and drinks simultaneously. For about 15 further minutes no one came to attend or even bother about our remaining order which we were still to place. We complained to the lady manager who was kinda running around helping people with seating. In about 45 minutes since we were seated, came a waiter for the order. We placed the order for drinks and starters. Another 15 minutes gone by, nothing. Then came our drinks (pegs), and our food. But no glasses, no ice, nothing. Waited for another 5 minutes, asked for glasses, the waiters got the glasses for but some other table and just went pass by us. By this time we've had enough wasting an hour with nothing being done. Just got up and went to another place nearby. Based on the experience I feel like giving them 1 but since my last visit was good, I am averaging them hoping that this is not a usual affair at MBH.

Nikhil Bhadran,"Rated Went there with few of my school friends. This place is waaaay overhyped! My bar square is better than this. First of all, we had to wait for around 15 minutes which was expected on a weekend so no worries there. After the wait we got a table which was not even cleaned. We had to call around 2-3 waiters and finally one of them turned around and came. We asked him to clean it, he said he will brb. Which again didn't happen. Then again we waited for around 15 minutes and finally got hold of a waiter asked him to clean the table and asked the menu. They had no beers other than corona and kingfisher. No Budweiser, Heineken nothing even though they were mentioned. Asked for 3 coronas. Later on he brought 2 coronas and one Amstel saying those were the last 2 coronas. Along with that tried some murgh malai chicken and mutton kababs, which again were nothing extraordinary. The most irritating part of the evening was when we settled the bill. None of the credit cards handed over by the 3 of us were getting accepted for some reason. Kudos to their cc swiping machine. At the end, all of us had to hand over cash and left the place with our wallets empty. Later on we tried our cards at Burger King and at a petrol pump and the cards were accepted.

The food tasted good. And all this costed around 2100 incl taxes. From my experience at other cafes and bars with so much taxes being levied, this was less than what I had been paying till now. The decor and ambiance gives you feel of a brewery with flags hanging from a high rise ceiling. With a lot of space and good music this place feels like the go to bar for a Friday evening with friends. With the all time low prices, you get to see mixed crowd here.

Nandini Baluja,"Rated I have been to this place twice now. The service sucks big time. The only reason I went another time was because I thought that since it was a newly opened place back then, may be I should cut them a little slack. But I was wrong. First the usher took us to a table which was already occupied (the occupants had gone out for a smoke with their stuff on the table), we had to find another table ourselves since we were already inside. This was followed by the staff taking their own sweet time (which ended when I myself walked up to one of the staff members) in giving us a copy of the menu. Summoning the order taker was another pain. Most of the drinks on the menu weren't available; even after ordering one from the few which were available, we were later told it is not. If this wasn't enough, the attendant in the ladies' washroom kept asking me for money.",Rated 1.0,7,31,??

But still to be honest to the people who are yet to try this place , if you want to have a good time enjoying your food and drinks , then this is not your place. The service literally sucks. I don't remember how many times do we have to look for people to get us fork. Yes, a fork , we wanted a fork for our food. To this level , the service was bad. This was not due to the rush , we could see 4-5 waiters ( sorry for the language , but it is their job) standing close to us, still not listening and it was like they did not care what we are asking for. They was late in taking orders , getting those orders and it all ended with the fork. If i have to say one good thing is - They get the drinks fast, pre-requisite is they listen when you are nagging them to tale orders. I am really disappointed that such a happening place could lack in management.",Rated 1.5,40,769,??

When you enter the HQ, you'd be greeted with same over-sweet yet pungent smell of hookah mixed with liquor. Separate smoking zone is an add-on to other my bars. The service is same...lethargic... Waiters r not attentive.. I ordered a virgin mojito and its sad to say it was the worst I ever tasted..u can't even taste the mint in the mojito...it tasted like over-sweet lemon soda..pastas were OK...but not to my taste as they were too spicy for me..paneer roll was okayish..their hookah was cold...

Himanshu Verma,"Rated Visited today at My Bar Headquarters with my friends. Wished i could give negative rating, but Zomato don't allow it. Their services SUCK (yes in capital and sorry for my language). The waiters don't even heed to your calling. Don't even know counting i guess (when specifically asked for 4 glasses, since we were four people, they still gave only three glasses). You have to ask for plates to serve yourself. Then the cherry on the cake (pun intended)... They cheat you and don't even return your remaining bill amount. I had a bill of Rs 2617 and i accidentally put Rs 2900 (i know its my mistake) . This waiter returned me initially Rs 100 saying that i have given more money (he should have given me Rs 200 which i gave extra). And then gave me Rs 80. When i confronted the waiter and the management about this, they said sir you must have been misinformed you didn't gave us Rs 2900.I said check in the CCTV camera, to which they said they will do within 15 minutes. Then another one from management came and said Sir it will take 1 hour (their intentions were quite clear). I said we will wait. Half an hour later, one of the management guy came and said 'sir 100 rupay ke liye kya ladna. Aap ye lijiye paise.' And didn't even have the courtesy to apologize You could clearly see on their faces that they have committed a mistake but did not have a little courtesy to apologize. And about the food and drinks, i ordered 1. Chicken lollipop 2. Chilly chicken 3. Veg pasta with white sauce 4. Grilled cottage cheese 5. Pina colada 6. Bloody mary The food was very ordinary. Similar to what you get on roadside Chinese stalls. Their are much better options out their. Give it a miss. Negative rating from my side",Rated 1.0,7,2,??

I don't get the logic ! Why not keep yourself stocked when you know that the demand is high ? We ordered lemon chicken again this time as last and were served with a completely different dish ! Left us wondering what we had ordered the last time ! How can you mix-up-the-orders/change-the-recipes-in-one-week (whichever of the two happened) !

The sweetness in the chilly potato along with a the light crispy potatoes along with sweet onions dripped in the chilly sauce was commendable.

Mostly college peeps visit this place as it offers variety of hookas and cheap food. I never seen a place with such a bad service. Every time they bring the food, either the spoon or plate or ketchup/chutney or something else was always missing. And the waiters took forever to serve. On food front, we ordered basic items like noodles, manchurian, butter chicken and mixed sauce pasta. Even a street hawker would make better noodles, vegetables in the noodles were raw and not even cut nicely. Past was the only dish we liked it was not amazing but better than others.

Anuj Karolia,"Rated After hearing about this place we went there yesterday for celebrating a friend's birthday. As soon as you enter, you get a feeling that it is HUGE with a very large space for seating. After waiting for almost 15 minutes we were made to sit. Lets talk about the ambience first, nice seating with good music and lighting (neither too dim nor too bright). Coming to the food, we ordered spring rolls, penne alferado, chilly potatoes, paneer tikka, italian smooch, virgin marry, paneer butter masala, butter naan and double apple hukka. If you are paying 200+ bucks for a paneer tikka and in return getting small chunks of paneer (without even a single slice of onion & capsicum) accompanied with a mint sauce which was no less than water then you would surely regret your order (Big Disappointment). Everything else was just average in taste except penne alferado which was good and paneer butter masala which was really nice. The drinks were just fine. Service (Must Read) - The snacks came after almost half an hour and that too in installments. No problem, accepted. But how would you feel that after asking 2-3 times and hafl an hour you come to know that the spring rolls are not available and the drink that you ordered with the snacks came when you have finished all of them. One of our main task was to constantly look for the waiter to attend to us (Pathetic!!). And it was really unaccepted when the spring rolls which were not available were included in the bill. When we asked for a fresh bill the waiter was busy deducting the amount himself and he refused that a fresh bill cannot be generated. 2 out of 5 for service. Will think twice before going again. Really Disappointed!!!",Rated 3.0,52,59,??

Rohini Gauba,"Rated The word 'Headquarters' left me intrigued but one thing was for sure, this place would be better off than the regular My Bar and would probably cost a little extra but given the ambiance is good, everybody agrees to pay even a higher amount. 25 of us reached the place unannounced and the staff was good enough to find us a place in 15 minutes on a Friday evening. Commendable Job. I am only going to talk about the food and ambiance in my review. On one side were huge Leather Couches, on the other were unfinished, high-rise rustic wooden tables. A combination of different settings all under one roof. Whenever people go out, they always end up ordering Pastas..so was the case with this group. Hell disappointed, I ordered finger food platters to taste a few of their starters in one go. Would only recommend their Indian Starters as they are good but less in quantity. Their serves were super attentive. Even though the place was jam packed and people were continuously pouring in, they delivered everything in no time without messing up with the orders. Another lounge in CP which can be considered as an option for people who always denied going to My Bar. Headquarters is your place.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Rishabh Malhotra,"Rated If you are looking for a fun filled music filled place in CP, this is the place to be. Visited this place last Sunday with friends and had a nice time. The music they played was really good. The cocktails n drinks are quite cheap here compared to other similar lounges in Delhi. The food is also good but limited in quantity though. That makes up for the low price of food. Crowd is good and you'll surely enjoy if you are having good company. You might have to wait for seat though if you don't have a prior reservation. Also, the service time is directly proportional to the crowd :)",Rated 4.0,80,335,??
Anasuya Choudhury,"Rated Hmmmm! This place reminds me of a railway station! So many people under one roof. First, definitely book a table in advance and reach there on time. They always have waiting even on weekdays. Slow service. Actually, extremely slow service. The age of the crowd will range from 20 to 70 years, considering that everyone comes their only for the cheap drinks they offer. Don't be surprised if you find yourself sitting next to a man your grandfather's age and boozing. Food is okay. The chilly chicken and dry paneer were the best bet. They are really slow when delivering. A hookah took us an hour to get. A tower of beer took them 40 mins and the whiskey we ordered came along with the bill. The waiters either forget your order or they get confused: too many people and too dark to remember faces. They mix water in their beer towers so I would suggest rather order the bottles. The only USP is the music. Go here only if money is an issue. We were 9 of us and our bill was 10000. If I find no other place to go, then I shall come here. Otherwise, I am not fond of so much of noise and so many people at one go and such bad service! P.S do remember to check your bill before paying.

Till the time I was waiting, the background music was making me curious to enter this place at that very moment. And then, after 15 minutes of waiting, when we were allowed to enter, our gang just went crazy to the positive vibes coming in and the feel good atmosphere already made us comfortable. The second time I visited in the afternoon on a weekday, this place was again occupied and had to wait to enter. Bottom line - Food and Ambience are Fab, Alcohol Prices are fairly fine.

Then aftr shouting a little bit, the person came to take order , and when we asked him why he was not listning He answeres so foolishly that we were not in the mood to order Who is he to decide ?

Shrey Kumar Singh,"Rated This place is like a shady restaurant styled in a classy way !!! Ambiance: This is perhaps the best part of the restaurant.. The ambiance is very happening...it's like music and DJ is present and the places seems to be lively even on a weekday evening !!! The place is huge and decently made, the look and feel of the place is youth n happening !!! I would have given it a rating of 3 if just for the ambiance if had not encountered the food n service... Food and Service: This is where the place sucks big time.... Talking about food we had chilly paneer, lemon chicken and paneer tikka and it was okay... The issue was with service... So we order the paneer starter and asked the staff to come back for more, we called him back in less than 5 mins and asked him to cancel one dish that was ordered and replace it with other which he agreed and went... 2 mins later he gets the dish that we asked to cancel and said sir it was already prepared... Which basically means that they are serving stale food, otherwise they can't prepare a paneer tikka in less than 6-7 mins... Post this we asked him to cancel the other one and he gets that also with the same reasoning and is not willing to accommodate... Which is a big turn off for the place... In the end he gets and bill in which we wanted certain change (to split the bill) however he said not possible as the bill is already generated... With this kind of customer service I don't think the place deserves a decent rating.. They have marketed them self for cheap food n alcohol and seems with it comes cheap service..... Not Recommended for its bad service !!!",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The ambiance is shady and just decent. Tan Wooden chairs which no way relate to a cafe , this place is a perfect bar. Too crowded and noisy forever. Food: You'd like the things here, but its like relationships. You won't find something you love too easily. The chilly potato and penne Alfredo are just decent. Do not expect an orgasm, you ! Food honestly is pretty average. Cheerup, its my bar! Drinks: Damn!! One word omnomnomnnom! Go for the Liit and a beer tower. Perfect evenings! Well yeah..

The music is good too and runs in tune to the tastes of most visitors. They also have an open air area if you don't wish to listen to the loud music playing around. However, I found their service really pathetic (it appears their waiters are all daydreamers). You will find the waiters here are miles away from professionalism and are least interested in taking orders (we waited for 15 minutes for the menu to arrive at our table) I am not sure but one of my friends (a seasoned drinker) also noticed their drinks to be diluted (the cheap liquor options may be the reason) A one time visit may be considered for sure.

The glasses in which my friends were served seemed unwashed as well. After calling the waiter three times, we managed to have the glasses changed. My friend ( who is very particular about his beer) asked for a beer mug, which they did not have. To add to our misery, the waiter who was serving us seemed terribly disinterested. Their menu had 10, or more, kinds of beer. But just two were available. Despite all this early drinks chaos, we managed to settle down. But the music wouldn't let us. There was a live drummer - who, sadly and with all due respect, was emitting just noise. Despite that, we braved it all.

Abhishek Bij,"Rated My bar is an adequately hidden American diamond. It glitters but with no intrinsic value. Approach - tucked away in n block of cp and not in gopaldas building as Google would suggest. You would think it's an obvious correction the management would make, but no. They want you to struggle and hunt and ask and call your friends and fight for parking 3 times before they reveal the establishment. Once you do discover the concierge on the ground floor does not give a damn, no directions to the elevator and you climb 2 stories which seem like 5 owing to cps liberal floor to floor heights. Not too much complaint about the climb but the corridor that leads to the bar. It's filthy horribly lit, no singage and semi broken air conditioning unit greets you. But once you enter, you are greeted by a massive massive massive bar with people and music and beer and happiness. The environment is perfect for an after office chit chat or a get together. I recommend you book a table cause this place was packed to the brim even on a Wednesday night. My bar headquarters is something that fits seamlessly in Connaught place of 2015. I love cp and it cannot be left behind with new punks like cyber hub and epicura. Food - slightly above average! It comes super soon for your comfort. No way it was not cooked 3 hours before. Either that or they have oracles assisting the chefs. Staff - polite but disinterested. The guy who was helping us was even willing to lie to get over with the order.

On entering, you will see a wide seating arrangement with a huge bar in the middle which will make you feel that you have come to the right place, but alas, when you will get seated you will just remain seated. What i mean is that, no one will come to handover a menu or take your order or atleast serve you water, as the basic etiquettes state. What is the point of opening a restaurant which you can't manage. Compared to the crowd, a very very less number of waiters which will obviously mean a chaos.

It's a Wednesday night and this guy says you're 7 stags (since when did you become a club, or Wednesday become a weekend?) you'll have to sit on the terrace. The terrace is an unfinished area..dimly lit, staffed with 3 to 4 servers for 8 to 10 tables of 4 seats. We sat , ordered (5 snacks, 12 pegs of jim beam <( I asked for a bottle because i wanted to check a sealed Jim beam bottle but for some reason the bottle is not on menu and the waiter did not want to give us the bottle. He said please buy 12 pegs at a time it is cheaper. ) > ,1 beer and 1 pina colada) and with in 7 to 10 mins the snacks came. The 12 pegs of jim beam came with 3 glasses 2 bottle of Soda. No water no Ice and 2 less glasses which were ordered. All the snacks are finished and we are waiting for the water and more glasses to come. to start the drinks This is 30 mins into the order. Then finally 2 glasses come and ice and water come in the next 5 mins. 4 people sitting next to us waiting before us for their glasses have already had enough with the waiters and after giving a final warning 10 mins prior were fighting with the waiter for such pathetic service and left midway..leaving their drinks and everything. I din't want to move the team of 7 people to another place so we just had to finish this meal and move on. So it's been 45 mins and the final drink the pina colada comes in. what an achievement. I had a headache in 2 pegs. definitely Jim beam mixed with something, i know from my 12 year history in this field. The service is truly the most pathetic i have seen anywhere in Delhi, I'd rather pay a little more anywhere else. I was running late otherwise would not have paid the 900 rs. Service charge of 10% which they clearly did not deserve. Eventually paid 12,200 and i'm sure they are into the business of charging taxes from customers but cancelling the bill at night and keeping the tax in their pockets so that is another waste.",Rated 1.0,5,2,??

This time it was jam packed... Waited for 20 minutes, And then got an isolated table in the inner room or something where they had a separate DJ I guess ( he put 7 songs on repeat and left) and coz this room had very few tables, it was very difficult to get a waiter to listen to you if you need something coz all of them are busy with the crowd outside....

The staff here is ill managed, doesn't know how to behave with the customers. This place seriously has lack of spoons and forks. We had our food ready on the table, with requested forks, which came up after 15 mins. Another waiter crashes in and just tries to hop off with those forks from our table, without even asking for it. The other waiter attending our table, tried to block him, but this waiter was keen on running away with it. And when asked for the manager, for such a misbehave, the waiter's response is ""JAA YAAR BULA LA MANAGER, INN LOGON K LIYE- KYA HI KAREGA"" A place in the center of city, with such a reputation, has illiterate people representing it. Other waiter as well, tried to move the chair, with my friend sitting on it, saying, its coming in the way.

Ordered for a non veg kebab platter. The whole platter was cold. The chicken was hard and cold. It was absolutely unedible. Them we tried to move to the vegetarian items hoping it will be a bit better. But it seems that the staff and the management are unable to cater to the large number of people who come probably for the not so expensive booze. We had ordered for a bottle of Gin. However when we ordered for another bottle, we were informed that they were out of stock. Since the bottle of Gin which was serves ro us was 2 pegs less, they said we would be charged for 23 pegs. Most of the items on the menu were unavailable. No lemon fish, no mutton or lamb starters, no beer tower was available and no corona beers. I requested to talk to the manager. He started giving a different story for the unavailable items saying that they are unavailable due to excise issues. It was a learning experience for me to know that fish tikka was treated differently than lemon fish by the excise department ;-) At last being so disappointed, we decided to move out. When we asked for the bill it had gross error. The peg of Gin which was in their menu for Rs. 159/- was charged for 189/-. On being questioned, the staff confidently claimed that the peg was for 189/-. However when the menu was shown, the staff suddenly shifted their stance saying that the cashier was new and he made a mistake.

There were like 10 empty tables like that but we were asked by the manager to go to a different table that is meant to accommodate only 3 people. Fair enough! But soon I realized why was that. There was a horrible band about to play live there and they had no audience to listen to their mic and sound testing. I complained about the annoying sound to the manager at least 5 times but didnt bother to offer me a different table. I had ordered beer that came like 40 mins later and I dont exactly understand the reason for that. I guess they were brewing it in house and serving in Carlsberg Elephant's bottle.

Being a Sunday night the place was packed and had a waiting period of 30+ minutes. Great crowd surprisingly. Separate smoking area is surely a welcome for a lot of customers. The problem although is that most of the times, kingfisher is the only beer available. The food choices are limited, but they do it fairly well. Everything we ordered was definitely palatable. Drinks menu, as my bar is famous, is pretty pocket friendly. Cocktails were surprisingly good at HQ. We order a LIIT pitcher, a cosmopolitan and a Tom Collins. Everything tastes like it should have. The place is packed on weekends, so make sure have a reservation, or be prepared to wait for a half hour or so. The place was more than half full even on a Tuesday evening! HQ definitely is a place you can just go to anytime, and if you get a table, have a decent time with friends. EDIT: Forgot to mention our server - Tejpal. Awesome guy.

The ambience inside it is good ...the crowd in also not bad. But their service was really pathetic. I had to wait for 15 minutes to get my beer. Once the beer arrived we had to wait for another 5 minutes for the glasses. And after 5 minutes when the waiter came with the glasses they were do different unidentical galsses.. anyhow we agreed to be served int hose galsses . It was my first time there.

Neha Singh,"Rated Something which started as a small place offering cheap booze some years back at pahar ganj , has now actually taken over Delhi and best of its places ( like CP , HKV , GK ) in a short span of time and is a favorite amongst delhites to hang out with friends and enjoy economical booze -- that's how I will describe My Bar in a gist. My BAR which already had two outlets in CP (one each in outer & inner circle) has now come up with a bigger & better version of it and is aptly named as MY BAR HEADQUARTERS ...it actually look likes one . Thanks to big big black-yellow boards which makes this place easily visible in N block of CP in the mid circle. It is located on second floor and there is a small elevator to take u there. Keeping in line with the new trends in CP of really huge & spacious cafes & bar , this place is also very huge . The ambience is dark and is dimly lit . The crowd at such places is mostly youngsters and so Music is loud and seating area is widespread as per such clientele. There is a bar just in the centre area and they have a live performance area too at one corner. The food menu is extensive for a bar place offering north Indian , Chinese , Italian etc . But I was bit disappointed with the bar menu ... as the place was bigger & better , I was expecting them to offer something new on the menu card compared to their other outlets . Infact , though there r many beers mentioned in the menu , only kingfisher and its variants were available , which was a disappointment for my friends. We went here to celebrate birthday of one friend and were just up for some drinks and some munching . Amongst drinks we ordered , LIIT , Chak de phatte , cosmopolitan and Sandy . All the drinks were good . Chak de phatte was almost as strong as LIIT . Out of all , Sandy was liked by all esp girls as it was light and perfect to taste buds for girls . In the food section , we ordered Veg Manchurian (dry) , chilly mushroom , Masala peanuts , Mexicana pizza & some my bar special pizza (can't recall name correctly). The food is the weak point of this place . The Manchurian balls were very hard to cut and hence a disappointment . Masala peanuts quantity was very less . Chilly mushroom were really bad and half cooked , so had to be sent back . Both the pizzas were decent to taste , full of toppings , Mexicana being spicier of the two . Food being a weak part , I have rated them 3.0 ; as otherwise this place was amazing for a group outing and having a good time with ur frens that too at decent prices . I hope they do improvise their food section .",Rated 3.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Ishaan,"Rated There's a reason its called 'my bar' because the service is so poor you literally have to serve yourself!! Like get up from your relaxed position,goto the bar, ask the waiter to load your drinks on a tray and guide him to your seat! We stayed there for a good one and a half hour all we could get was a beer tower( limited options) and a veg platter ( served chilled ) . And then after all this,to pay, again you need to go to the counter and say please take our money we want to get out of this place! 2.5 stars only because the price we had to pay for this was good!

Wen v ordered salt n pepper for the second tym it was too salty. Mocktails were good. I also ordered veg pasta in white sauce which was bland wid no vegetables so v returned it.

Sarthak Pandey,"Rated Another below-average place carrying the name of the shady but cult Paharganj haunt. This one has a great ambience but the service and food as usual are terrible. Plus, these people start acting high and mighty on weekends and will turn you away if you go there with a couple of guy friends. Plus, the My Bar's USP which has always been to serve cheap adulterated alcohol (an optimist would call it a cocktail of similar-testing alcohol) is missing here. Instead these people are selling alcohol at CP rates which means that there is a good chance that you may be overpaying for adulterated alcohol.",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Tarasha Diva,"Rated So I gave 3.5 only for the decor and the amaaazing sufi night which we weren't aware of before going! Tuesday night! Located near dunkin, on the 2nd floor of N block. Closest to F block from metro. The place is huge, really cool with dim lighting n good interior n comfortable seating. And my best part is that the headquarters have a separate smoking room :D Coming to drinks, sadly they don't keep any shakes so that was disappointing for me though my friends love mybar for its cheap drinks! Food and servicing gets a thumb down. So the chilly potato is tasty. I ordered the Mexican veg pizza (don't order this please), has a very tingy taste with the crust very hard and no taste at all. Also I ordered a coke but till the end they did not get it :/ I have been here before and that time I had ordered chilly chicken and malai tikka which has a good taste! And the servicing, so I get it that u have a Sufi night but u better talk to your customers properly when they ask u whats good to eat. I asked this guy that what all is there in the pizza and he had some major attitude problem telling me so, making faces and saying ""arrey yaar"" on everything. Gave him a bashing though. That was HIGHLY DISSAPOINTING. The Sufi night was the saviour and the owner, let me in in the VIP lounge without reservations, had a blast dancing to the great jugalbandi!

With just one day in Delhi and taking my firangi friends to a place they might enjoy after a long day of shopping, I decided to take them here. The place has another feel to it, unlike the other bars and cafs in Delhi. We came here early evening and found a good table for our group of 8. We started off with two beer towers and 3-4 cocktails along with Peri Peri chicken wings, masala peanuts, french fries, and also ordered a kiwi paan shisha/hookah . the order, however took way too long to be served. Everything we ordered satisfied us for the price paid for it, and the shisha, for someone coming from the land of shisha, was just average for a hefty price of 1k. The music was liked by all and the ambience was good enough to keep us here till night.

Sinchita Kar,"Rated When your best friend gets job in her first interview you are bound to celebrate! So since she gave a treat, we decided to go somewhere nice with alcohol provided. AMBIENCE: Located at N block, it was easy to find because of its large black hoarding written in yellow. We took the elevator and went to the second floor. We got out and I realised that my bar HQ takes up a huge place. Wooden floored with a vibrant crowd present on a Monday afternoon (4pm). Surprising isn't it? Thankfully a waiter came and helped us find a seat for two. FOOD/DRINKS: We decided to order vodka shots and chicken pasta in white sauce. The vodka shots were presented to us in a glass salt rimmed along with some slices of lime to accompany the drink. The chicken pasta was in a sufficient amount for three however it was extremely disappointing. The chicken pieces were almost absent except for small ones that caught on the fork. Additionally the sauce was very dry and floury. Not cheesy at all. They should really work on the food. SERVICE: It was prompt. They served us quickly. They knew their alcohol menu inside out and were helpful in deciding us what next to order since draught beer tower was absent that time. Plus they were helpful when my friend asked for salt less rimmed shot glasses and they happily obliged. Overall, it was a mix of hits and misses.

The music and crowd are better too. Thank fully they have kept a separate smoking zone now and that makes it better for non smokers. What disappointed me was the food. I ordered a Kathi Roll which was served after 15-20 minutes and was cold. I complained and asked them to change it. It took another 20 minutes to get the replacement and this time they served a Paneer roll which certainly was not what i ordered and it was very salty.

Poor hygiene ( glasses were stinking, uncleaned plates) : and when we asked them to change the glasses they accepted that it was stinking but dint feel that it was wrong. Not even they felt sorry for that. 5. Very cheap sales strategies: they don't provide normal RO water, they only provide mineral water and that too over priced. Secondly, we ordered Bira (draught beer) , glasses were not even filled properly. It was 3/4 filled only.. Overall, the place is for those who jus want cheap liquor and place to sit...

And now the worst part , MUSIC Someone please ask the DJ to go and learn good kind of music.I wonder that was he really a DJ or some staff or chef playing the bad music.Go get classes first.

I entered the place with 4 friends and had to wait for around 30 minutes despite booking the table in advance. But having spent 30 minutes inside I realized the place is worth the wait. As the alcohol went in,the speakers roared out top charts and the ambience and the people there created such a environment that I have to say this is the craziest place I have ever been to in Delhi. The food service was a bit delayed may be because of the huge crowd that is quite obvious in the peak night hours on a Saturday night.

In starters we ordered the mixed chakhna platter which was quite normal with papad, masala peanuts and some bland alu chaat along with lemon chicken which was quite good. Further we ordered spicy chicken pizza which was decent but not spicy at all. Last dish was chilly potato which was just okay.nothing great and can be avoided Service is quick but nobody pays attention to your table easily. If took us 5 minutes each time to call and order. Ambience is dark and bit shady mainly because of the people around you, shit drunk and senseless. Music was too loud for me. And price for 2 is not 1000 as it says here on zomato page.

FooDilicious...,"Rated My bar HQ had this band playing named jaal on that Thursday evening. A musical night is something that I dont wanna miss and I believe it had been pretty much worth the money spent This place has pretty big seating area and have quiet nicely done interiors. So for the first impression the place made a good one. But at the service end the servers are really in need for an up-gradation to a bit more professional onez and shud have the knowledge about the stuff they are serving on the menu. When it came to recommendation the guy was blank n could not recommend any thing beyond chilly chicken. Still fine we managed that end and ordered some stuff. But the service was too slow n considering the fact the place was jam packed n food preparations could take some time so can be excused. Then booze took like 10-15 mins to get to the table n not all of it together another one took 10 n then afterwards came rest of the stuff like ice n all on constant reminders. So over all the service part was a bit saddening. But when the band started playing the time was no longer was problem :p ;) FOOD We ordered Chilly chicken dry, prawns salt n pepper, country roast chicken salad, chicken lollipop, kung pao chicken, chicken fried rice. Chicken salad tasted all fresh, juicy and a bit on the sweet side but over all nicely prepared. Liked it Chilly chicken was good n cooked well n had the right spice content, not exclusively good but was nice. Prawns salt n pepper was another good one cooked just perfectly n just the right amount of everything. Personally I liked it most. Chicken lollipop was simply batter dipped fried chicken served with dip, not much of a distinct taste.so average for me. The kung pao chicken was not up to the mark, was too much salty and was asked to be prepared again with some gravy and accompanied with chicken fried rice. But sadly that as well didnt worked for us was again too much salt so not good. Overall the best part of the evening was the musical band that just made the mood and the liquor prices, I suppose just unbeatable.Food wise nothing much to specially go for but to enjoy some music with some booze n starters a definite thumbs up for me.

Hina Gupta,"Rated Unmanaged and horrible are the two words that immediately strike my mind if I talk about my experience at My Bar Headquarters in CP especially on Friday Night. We booked a table in the afternoon for the convenience and still after getting the confirmed reservation we had to wait there for 30 minutes. The staff was unprofessional and not trained. The owner of the place was also least bothered to the customers' request. I have been to many restaurants and this was the worst one, which I am definitely not going to visit ever. The rubbish quality of food and drinks was another horrible experience for me. The empty plates with hardly any pieces of spring rolls, lemon chicken and chilly chicken were making us feel Taft we are having either leftovers or the outlet is short on food and drinks. I have never been to such a sucky place ever in my life and Urdu me after visiting this place my experience is this place is overhyped. I was there with good company hence we had good time in our own cocoon but otherwise this was the shittiest place I have ever visited in my life. Not recommended to anyone. Rs. 1000/- for two is also wrong. It cost more than that.",Rated 1.0,28,52,??

But the ambience you get there needs no score, its fantastic. You wanna get happy high?

Kranti Vikram Singh Bhandari,"Rated Nothing less then a criminal assault. Couple of days back me along with a friend entered this place. We were 2 beers down the environ was nice, live music was being played at quite a din. Hence, Adeline rush pumped us, and we started moving towards the front where people were dancing. On the way my leg got entangled on a hookah pipe, which was lying on middle of the alley and the ambience being dark I wasn't able to see it. Anyhow the hookah came down from the table and its base broke. But I didn't realised as being lost in spur of moment, we continued to the dance floor. Two guys came and asked us to step aside and started showing hookah prices on their mobile. And said u broke the hookah and hence u r liable for the amount and we being generous are just charging u 3.5k. Being a regular customer of the place I wasn't expecting this kind of confrontation from the staff. Anyhow we tried real hard to make them understand that it wasn't our fault as we can't be expected to see such pipes lying on dark alleys. The things got quite heated up 3 staff guys were guarding us so that we don't leave. I was asked by the manger not to talk because as per him I was very high and not in state to understand, just 2 beers down how could anyone on earth loose all his senses to even walk. But nevertheless they said we will check on our CCTV. And that CCTV report never came and, ultimately getting fed up with all this stupid brawl, I ended up paying 2 k for just entering in not so fit state as per them. My whole point is if i had had done a mistake I must be made liable for it, but charging anything as they like and holding me guilty without any checking is surely not the way. And definitely a way to shoo of their loyal customers. I am not sure whether ever will I be able to enter this place, as this one experience was way too strong to override all my good memories over that place.",Rated 1.0,6,15,??

Prachi Jain,"Rated on a sunday afternoon, i expected this place to be very crowded and so it was! after a few minutes of waiting, we got a seat on bar counter and here is what all i can summarize: 1. music was awesome, loud enough for a bar. the dj also played music that we requested. 2. service needs to be improved considerably. not only the service was slow, but also the staff was pretty confused. we got food on our table 5 times which we did not order. the staff did not know where to take the dishes! I guess increasing the number of waiters might help. food: 1. Summer garden pizza was really nice. The size of pizza, amount of cheese and toppings were all satisfying and fulfilling making it a happy meal. 2. LIIT was a little bland in taste. Neither it possessed the sharp taste of alcohol nor it was sweet due to coke., however, the bartender tried to fix it when we expressed. 3. cosmopolitan: Was very light and refreshing. The flavour of cranberry fused well with vodka. a nice drink. 4. sex on the beach: The contents made it a little more sweet than it should be. The alcohol notes were very minute. what was disappointing was that they were out of beer pints of any company other than kingfisher which was very strange. In fact, in pint also they had only kingfisher ultra and no light version was available. Having the label of bar and non-availability of beer brands on a Sunday afternoon is actually strange. Best part is the price. Very affordable.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

After half an hour of waiting, we were shoved into a corner (near the loo) with the speakers blaring right on top of us playing awful music. The space is absolutely dingy. It took the waiter nearly 15 minutes to get us the menu and 20 minutes more to get a simple virgin mojito which was far too sweet and far too warm. Any salad you order will be floating in something they seem to call dressing. All fried food is covered in batter and the non vegetarian rolls are full of onions and cabbage.

Shivani,"Rated It was a Saturday night and we knew that whole of CP would turn out to be crowded. So we made reservations at an XYZ place for 9:00. But when we reached we were informed that well be seated at about 11:00. In a frenzy we started calling all other joints and all the people we knew could get us a booking. Finally somebody got hold of someone who knew someone and we had ourselves an arrangement at My Bar Headquarters. We were a group of 15 people and were lucky to have gotten a seating. The moment we exited the lift we could feel the vibe of the place. Sure it was a Saturday night and hence the crowd, whatever the reason- it was amazing. The music was really great and there was a bounce in the air. The bar section is situated in the middle of the loft and the whole area is aesthetically lit (to go with the joints image that is). We settled in and ordered 2 AK-47s, some starters and choice of alcohol. The order was pretty elaborate and I cannot list every bit here, but what I can attest to is that everything was good (nothing was extraordinary though). After a while of enjoying the place we went onto order the main course which included staple north Indian dishes- dal makhani, some other veggies and breads. The entire main course was really good. I wanted to go to this place form the moment we made plans but one of my cousins had a preconceived image of My Bar. But he has since changed his view for this particular joint. I think where there is cheap booze there are some inebriated drunks, but this joint has good arrangements to avert any unfortunate incidences. It was a brilliant night, loved the vibes, the AK-47s, the music, the food and the company. Will definitely love to visit this place again.",Rated 4.0,18,31,??

Though, i had called and reserved a table, they made me wait for some 30 minutes before giving us seats. 1st dissapointment. Now, post ordering our hookah, booze and food, we waited for another good 45 minutes before our first order came, and that too our main course was served first and the starter came towards the end, while we were winding up. 2nd dissapointment. For our hookah, the very first thing that we ordered , we had to literrally chase the waiters to know the status of this order. None of them were paying attention and the place was in complete mess. We were not even given main course plates. we had to eat in small starters plates. 3rd dissapointment. And to top all the dissapointments, when we complained to one of the waiters , he answered "" Ma'am koi baat nahi, kabhi kabhi aise bhi adjust kar lena chahye"" Woah. I was frustated as hell.

Well I must say they did a good job with the entry check and security well now once in for a bar the decor is just right with ample spacing. So for its concept and decor would say bang on. Next once we were seated hit the alcohol and good job with the drink as have been to place where they serve you cheap stuff and a lot of mixing with the drinks but this place was clean and ordered a lot of starter as was dying of hunger and really could not drink on an empty stomach now that's the goof up as some appetiser came quick and the rest came like when we were a bottle down on and on the second and we kept following up on it but it finally arrived but really late and for the stuff food wise I would say it pretty decent except the wait. Coming to the music the band totally rocked the jugni band is awesome totally rocked that we actually drank a lot and didn't get high as was having a good time with the music really rocked you guys need to visit their Sufi night on Thursday ........... The best part I like is that the bouncers are good at their jobs very attentive and alert and took care that no one misbehaved that the toughest part in a bar to take care of and must say hats off guys. The sad part after enjoying what was a downer is the way down to the exit the door was locked and the doopy gaurs didn't inform us and we went down and the door was locked n like had to climb back up and then take the lift down which sobered us up......? sad as we really loved every thing but a few hick ups but no problem as the band ?really compensated for it.,Rated 4.5,22,249,??

You can find a seat at the bar though , if lucky enough. It's quite spacious and the dining area is nicely done. It's totally a place where you can chill with your friends and grab a couple of drinks and food. So I ordered a L.I.I.T and it was like always , amazing. My friend ordered a skew driver ( I know , why? ) and it was pretty decent actually. Then we grabbed a couple of beers. Coming to food , we ordered a chilly chicken and a veggie pizza. I love thin crust pizzas and it was too good. There are around 8 pieces. Chilly chicken was just like any other place. Later on we ordered hummus with pita and it was pretty decent.

Avishek Dasgupta,"Rated The best thing about this place is the cheap booze. A good place to chill out with friends but don't expect much from the food....actually don't expect anything from the food. Was highly disappointed with it. We were a big group, so ordered many dishes. Dry Chilli chicken, Bar Be Que chicken, drums of heaven, White pasta, french fries, spicy chicken pizza, mexicana pizza were some. Apart from the pizza and pasta which were strictly average, nothing else is worth a mention. The service was pretty poor too...had to call waiters multiple times to serve what we wanted. About the ambience, it was decent in the beginning but felt overcrowded as the evening progressed. Actually, we enjoyed more on the balcony later, where we could sit and chat among ourselves (Yes, there is a big balcony overlooking the park where you can smoke too :P) So yes, thumbs up for the cheap drinks and cool hang out place...but the niceties pretty much end there.

While surfing the Cannaught place saw a hoarding which said cheapest booze in the city, thought was a marketing trick but to our surprise the booze was really cheap, don't know about other places in Delhi but was definitely than most places in Bombay. We were there for like 45-50 mins and we managed to do a billing of 5K, majorly because of the Taxes. Still I feel it was a good 40-50 mins, food was good, booze was cheap as I have mentioned earlier, had hookah and the place was buzzing. Awsm place to be on a weekend.

Sanil Mahajan,"Rated Most travelers to Delhi will land up at CP at some point on their trip for shopping, eating, drinking or just hanging out. My biggest complaint about this place was always been about overpriced bars until I stumbled upon My Bar HQ on this trip. My colleague was handed out flyers showing some ridiculously low prices and insisted we head to My Bar to check the authenticity. Upon seeing the flyer, my first thoughts were that it would be an open air, shady bar with hidden prices/taxes but I was surprised when I entered the place. My Bar HQ is big. And it is air conditioned. This was definitely a pleasant surprise for me. And yes, the rates are as low as what was shown on the flyers. With 30 ml pegs of Vodka starting at Rs.57, no one can complain. And it is a very decent, up market bar so great to know that they've managed to keep the rates so low. Additionally, they also have combo offers on all hard drinks so if you're in a group, you pay even less. We were quite full so didn't try any food. Only reason for a 3.5 rating is the service. I found the staff to be rude and very curt. No one attended to our table for the first 15 mins even after multiple requests and the bar being 20% occupied. We tried to be as polite as possible with the staff and even joked a bit but failed to get even a smile from any of them. Pretty strange! And what is even more strange is that Hukkas are allowed in the AC section but you can't smoke a cigarette. Hmmmmm... thedarkrebel.wordpress.com",Rated 3.5,31,275,??

From a cheap and cheerful drinking joint to an extremely spacious, clean, and well done place. The music is also really good. Fortunately I went to this place when EDM music was being played. The booze is reasonably priced and My Bar is known for the same. They also serve a good variety of Herbal Sheeshas. Do try the Pan Kiwi Flavour.

Sreespace,"Rated One of the most economical but happening place to drink, dance and groove in Delhi. It's located bang in the heart of CP,hence people from all corners of Delhi throng in. We checked in around late evening on a Friday weekend and initially the crowd seemed maddening. But if you have some pub hopping experience you cn navigate your way through and find a seat quickly. There is altogether a different experience sitting g around the bartender area but getting their service and attention is tough. Tip - I would suggest you catch hold of a waiter once you enter, tip him or cajole home to get you a table quickly. Since its a crowded pub and there are lot of instances of people leaving without paying hence there is a close watch or marking provided by waiters for every table. Hence you can get the best of service by this reason. Do try their flavor hukkas. Food quality and starters are also good. In a nutshell we binged hard and drank tight - all for around 1500 per person which is quite cheap for the standards of a decent Delhi bar",Rated 3.5,39,30,??

Shubhi Agarwal,"Rated Friend suggested going here and the place serves nice drinks and not too heavy on the pocket as well. As we went on a Sunday, the place was crowded like crazy and it took 30 min of wait time to get a seat. So much so that the place was heavily understaffed to handle all the tables. The worst part was when one of the staff took away a chair from our table without asking, while a friend was away and didn't listen as we shouted to leave the chair. Later another person got us a chair after waiting for some 5 mins. Then as we ordered drinks and food, another person came to our table and started questioning us for our ages if we were under 25. We showed IDs but they still kept bugging us. This was really unaccounted for. The drinks were fine but the food wasn't great. We got white sauce pasta which was saltless, and veg Manchurian with Hakka noodles. The Manchurian had excess salt and too liquidy. Also as we asked for ketchup, surprisingly they had added water to tomato ketchup. Water, tissues and cutlery also had to be requested to be given on our table.

The person who was waiting on us came to inform us that our seat will be ready in some time. He poked me on my back to draw attention to what he was saying. But he did not move his hands. Instead he kept it on my shoulders and then smacked my back. I was not comfortable with his behaviour. I complained after which he was shifted from our table.

Upmark in every aspect you demand from a decent bar except the waiting to get in and the service which makes you scratch your head. Your order reaches your table after decades past ordering except beer which reaches just on time, so no issues there. A cool place to hangout but head to this place only if you are up for loud music.

The immense waiting and the jam packed crowed despite huge seating space speaks for the place's popularity. Some amazing EDM followed by insanity and craziness makes it worth visiting for. People here don't gather for food but for booze and Hukka. The two things which unite even the strangest of people sitting together. We ordered a white sauce pasta, overloaded cheese nachos and mushrooms but were highly disappointed with the food. What made us stay and have some great time were Beer Pitchers and Pan Base Hookah.

And yeah it did serve the purpose for us, the place is certainly not the coolest but yet nice and happening. Go their if you are not too critical about the food and service. Yes , with that a huge crowd ,theres always an impact on service, however it does a fairly good job at making your evening better. Over all a cool place to chill if you dont wanna blow much with fancier places tucked in cyber hub or Hauz khas village. We ordered a no of dishes, out of which lemon and karahi chicken turned out nice and rest of the food was ok. Word of caution & update:Place can be too crowded on weekend evenings and service can be utterly poor. On my second visit, in order to get one thing, we were required to remind waiters at least 5-6 times before it came on table, service quality is now a big question mark for this place, updating my review and rating accordingly.

Made reservations but to our surprise and chagrin when we reached there our name isnt on the roster. The attitude of the attendants wanst apologetic in the least and they took their own sweet time in getting a table for us. When we did get one, we had to repeatedly get the guy's attention who was supposed to take our order. Add to that the surprise lack of options in beer. Not due to dearth of options in the menu however but due to unavailability. Was surprised how they could run out of stock on a Friday night. The Chakna Platter they served here was far below the standards of what we had at one of their other outlets. The Veg Manchurian however was one of the better ones that i have tasted. The place was full to capacity with the music being a touch too loud. However the best part of the whole experience was the sketches of people who had outstanding dues being displayed at the entrance. Good crowd and a good enough place to hangout.

The previous Saturday was a dry day, so place was filled to its capacity but were lucky to get table in 15 minutes. We ordered hara bhara kabab and that dish made tge day for us. I have had this dish number of times at various restaurants but I can say it without any doubt that it was best made and served here.

Sargam Bansal,"Rated Went there on Sunday Evening. Though other lounges were not that crowded on Sunday's you can expect good gathering at any time in My Bar. Still we got the seat easily. I really liked the ambience. Service: 2.0 | Really Worst, No one is ready to attend the customers. We placed the order after waiting for 30 mintues. We did not got the spare chair for around 15 minutes for a friend of us who joined us few minutes later. Music - 4.0 | So Let's talk a bit about the Music... DJ was good. I enjoyed the tracks. Food - 3.0 | We ordered Chicken Loli[pop & Dahi Kabab. Food can be rated as average. They need to change their chef. Drinks - 3.0 | Cocktails cannot be considered as really great. ""Sex on the Beach"" was more alike a fruit juice. Sheesha - 3.0 | That's the only thing for which they took less time. It wasn't bad, but could have been better. Overall I can rate the place @ 3.0. If you want to sit for long house to enjoy the music and drinks (excluding Cocktails) this place can be best option and will never pinch your pockets too.",Rated 3.0,22,71,??

Experience was one of the bad ones, We went there to drink and have hookah, Firstly the hookah was over priced @ 1000/- and came in a large ak47 base . It lasted just a couple of mins and was pathetic and believe me when i say this as i am a shisha lover . The Guy tried to change it a couple of times and tried all his tricks but in vain. Alcohol was quite cheap but the staff response was dismal.

Ridiculous service and waiters are the worst bunch of people I have ever seen.They don't know what's in their restaurant menu. Menu card is just a piece of cardboard with no food written in details.Food quality is worst and ambience is so dark that you can't even read the menu card properly. Complete waste of money and time. Tremendously overpriced. They don't serve most of the food written in the menu which already has very little options. Asked the waiters if they had chilli chicken, they will ask if you want a 'veg'. Shocked to see how bad this restaurant was in almost all possible departments - be it food, service, ambience. If you are very daring, do definitely visit this place once.",Rated 1.0,1,12,??

The food is okay nothing special about it , the only thing that make's me want to give more rating is the hookah. It was just great , best one I've had so far in CP. if you are looking for a nice place to catch up with old friends and not very choosy about the brand of beer you should go otherwise I would suggest you not to.

Vishakha Singh,"Rated I somehow just can't resist the idea of a perfect evening ending with drinks which is why me and my friends landed on to mybar headquarters. On my 1st step inside I was too happy since there was huge huge amount of space, good music and the ambience seemed so chic and cool but alas as always my hapiness was limited to a few minutes. The seatings here are widespread mixed with chairs and couches. We chose the latter one but wanted to move elsewhere since the ac was not effective. My friends had an argument with the staff since they were not polite enough and trust me their rudeness got treated well with a well dose for the good. We ordered a beer tower, hookah, 2 portions of chilly potato, chilly chicken and chicken wings. The food was okayish but was seriously low on spices and salt!!!! N Indeed indeed overpriced with a very less portion size. Coming to the weirdest part, their menu had a good amount of beers mentioned but woow nothing was available on a Tuesday afternoon apart from king Fisher ultra max which was not mentioned in the menu and way too over priced compared at other bars.. The hookah was okay!!!! Total bill : 4600rs!! Pheeew Ps: They hv this separate small room as the smoking room. So each time u wanna puff. Move up, walk, smoke, come back! Excusez moi... Mnt entering this place again.",Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

The food was overpriced. Tasty yes. They just served kingfisher. All the other beers were out of stock. Hookah over priced at 680 rupees.,Rated 3.0,10,36,??
Micheal Uppal,"Rated I would say this one is best of all My Bar chains till now. My Bar well known for its best prices for alcohol. Ambience here is quite good, this time they worked in best way in terms of music too. Dj's here are good too and sound system and Dj Booth here is quite good. Servicing here is good except few staff member as I visit there almost every weekend, found few staff members to be playing around with bill things. But if I keep this thing apart then its perfect. There is a separate smoking zone that shan't be there but spoking on your tables is prohibited so this is a bit concern for smokers who have to carry their drinks all the way to the smoking room.

They havent changed much of the cost o the food items that they had back in their older branches. The prawn salt and pepper was good even chicken too.

The manager was more confused than a virgin on his first night. The staff was worse off. The worst thing is that half of their bar menu was missing.

You have ample amount of space and the decor has been given importance unlike the other outlets. The menu is slightly different but the quality has increased.

Very chewey and tasted really bad. Chicken salami was just warmed a little and served on a platter with a very meagre quantity of black olives and a cherry tomato for some strange reason. The service was the worst part. Staff was not courteous. After sitting at a table we were asked to move twice and it took almost 30 minutes for us to get a menu. And they took just as long to serve the food and drinks. The reason I gave this place a 2 star rating was perhaps because the ambience was decent and the music was acceptably good. All in all, this is one place I would strongly recommend against visiting. Mainly because of bad food, discourteous staff and horrible service.",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Please give a demo to your staff that beer has to poured softly into the glass but not like water from a bottle.

TheNomNomAnkita,"Rated It's a pleasant surprise when u enter this place after frequenting the shady My Bar in CP, but be prepared to wait for at least 1/2 before u can get a place to sit coz it's packed. Now for the drinks- no they aren't cheap by My Bar's standards, the waiters are super rude. Ordered the signature dahi ke kebab, My Bar's most famous delicacy, but they didn't seem anything close to what they serve at the other My Bars, as mentioned before the drinks were overpriced, the place full of couples who don't get a place to make out and the staff needs a lesson or two in etiquettes. Disappointed to the core.",Rated 2.5,50,107,??
Vignesh Chandiran,"Rated As always... mybar lives upto its name when it comes to good food and reasonable liquor. Amazing ambience, really awesome DJ. The only issue that I faced was of seating, as there was management to take care of customers with their seats and it took us about 45 seats to get one. A quick suggestion- please reserve a table id possible before heading to this place.",Rated 4.0,16,97,??
Swati Sawhney,Rated The place is nice food is good so is the price of the drinks .. but cause of the it becomes a mess.. and the people have to suffer by either stand at the Bar n drink or else exchange their seats .. lol n the best part is .. the exchange of seats which you do a favor to them then forces you to stand .. till the time the other table is free .. n then wait till the table is under your name .cause the funda is that they will not take the order until the previous person leaves .. so in short .... you do good to them n in return get fckd up coz they got What they want but gives a shit to what the customer goes through .. special thanks to AMIT FOR THIS,Rated 1.0,3,32,??

Still the music was so high u could hear outside the building. Also inside the plates were getting the jitters from the music. Found extremely difficult to talk. On to environment, was cool. Hipsters and young college students were there plus office goers. Food was ok nothing exceptionally good to write. Reasonably priced drinks and foods. At the time of reservation I checked for happy hours they said full day but in the bill it was not so. Anyways may be a day with live band would be better choice.

Piyush Juneja,"Rated Time for review! Been long since I last shared my views but this place made me sit up and take notice. I went there with a group of friends and did not have any high hopes as such ( been disappointed by The Vault Cafe in the past, which is in the same building ) but what transpired proved to be a nice foodie experience. The place had a good 'hang out with friends' vibe and was buzzing with energy. So, it checked the first box in my list with ease. Now comes the more important part and that's food! And safe to say, it did not disappoint. We had veg platter, peri peri pizza and chicken steak among other things and all of these tasted well. It is not iconic like the big daddy of 'em all, The Hard Rock Cafe, but it is a good enough place to while away time with your friends and have food that pampers your taste buds.

Saurav Vaish,"Rated Woah..!! What happened here. My Bar has always been the go to destination when looking for an economical place to booze but a compromise on crowd and ambiance. But this new Headquarters in CP has really turned it around and how..! First thing that strikes you when you enter is how huge the place is, its massive. They've really put in some big bucks here. The ambiance is rocking. Well lit, amazingly designed and setup with the big bar at the center. You just get the feel when you walk in with music buzzing in your head. The place is such a hit already that it might be hard for you to find a place and probably would have to wait for one. Amazingly the prices are still as economical as they always were and that's probably why the place is almost full. They have almost everything on the menu that you can ask for. Food has always been good at MyBar and the prices make them even worthier. The only bad point is the service. Not just that the service is slow but most service guys are inadequately trained to handle a place as big is this. All in all, its a place worth burning your cash in. Booze Dance Party..!!

I ordered masala peanuts and a non-veg dish, the name of which I'm not able to recall, and both of them were delicious. However good the quality was, it lacked quantity, and that was a bit of a disappointment. I also ordered a cosmopolitan, which was perfect, bittersweet and had a hint of lime in the end.

Nice decor, above an average food, good crowd and a better service then rest of the my bar. Chicken biryani was fine, pitchers are nice too. Sheesha is well prepared. All the things at a fair price. Location is good too. But it still lacks the standards of a good bar. It still has a lot of work to do to have its name among the best. We had what we wanted and then we just wanted to go out. It misses the appeal to stay. But I hope that can be worked out. That's why I gave it 3.5.",Rated 3.5,17,22,??

Initially we thought that it was not a good idea. But, it turned out to be completely wrong. The snacks were simply yumm!!! Accompanied by live sufi music, the ambience was just so easy to mingle with. The liquor was also easy on the pocket. Half a mark has been negated because of the delayed service response.

It had a 15mim waiting but a well lit and air conditioned waiting area. Very cool interiors with led lights and graffiti. The bouncers n entry team was organized. We got our table ordered beers and mocktails. The crowd is very young and happening. The DJ rocks with awesome peppy music. It is huge in size. I loved it.. The decor, Ak 47 / Eiffel tower shaped sheesha, roof all added to the spunk of the place.. The service was below par but that has been with all my bar outlets.

I love the pricing on their menu. The place is so affordable. Then we ordered this mixed sauce penne pasta and sm more chinese starters. Surprisingly the food was good as its always average in hauz khas and ppl only go for their cheap liquor prices. I was pleased with my bar hq as the food and the liquor experience was good this time.

I liked the idea of making a separate room for smoking. The ambience was pretty good, the food as always great and of course the liquor, priced enough to not to burn your pockets.

Aditi Kumar,Rated Visited with friends Saturday afternoon. Good ambience but crappy service. The hostess ar the door was just sitting for namesake and was more interested in pointing us the direction rather than actually talking. The person handling our order seemed uninterested and was borderline rude. We waited almost half an hour for our order for food ultimately cancelling the same.

Samyak Ranjan,"Rated One late Friday night, me along with my friend went to My Bar HQ on high recommendations from a friend. It was full as expected and after about 10 mins waiting, the guy outside was able to find us a place for two, but infront of the bar. That was fine for us so we went inside. I was literally awestruck how successful MyBar has become! It was literally bustling with people and parties. The crowd was pretty good and like most of the good bars, there were bouncers to protect and keep the sanity of the crowd. We ordered a LIIT, branded Beer and a Chicken Tikka The LIIT was quite well made, it was strong but not overpowering. The Chicken Tikka were raw. The taste overall would have been great if they would not have been undercooked. The service inside was VERY bad. The bartender was trying his best to pay attention to us but obviously there were so many people customising their favourite cocktails. But it was the servers which really got me a little bugged. They literally heard us, told us 1 minute and never came back. It happened twice, and the third guy was too busy chatting with another server 2 feet away from us and didn't have a care in the world.

Gaurav Wasan,"Rated For the cheapest 'daru' in town, My bar is the place to be. We were searching for a place for a friend's birthday, a place that serves cheap alcohol, a place with the decent ambiance, a place which serves yummylicious food and a place which is at the end value for money. So with a little help from Zomato we came across My bar headquarters and decided to book a table for 9 here. As it was a Sunday evening we were prepared for the maddening rush and upon reaching here we got what we feared. This place was packed to it's capacity and people could be seen easily standing in the queue for their turn, though we had our table booked we still had to wait for good 30-35 minutes for us to grab one. But the table we got could only manage 5-6 people at one time and we were assured that as soon as the other table in our bay vacates we will be given one but that actually never happened. If I will visit My bar headquarters again it will be because of the ambiance. This place is electrifying on weekends and I am sure same would be the case on weekdays too. A huge space for bar is reserved bang in the middle and some 200-250 seating arrangements is easily available here. Beautiful wooden tables and chairs finished with hard wearing matte oil will catch your attention at first. They also have separate lounges for a larger groups but on a weekend try avoiding that because at the end of it who will end up sharing this with someone else. Wonderful wall hangings, sputnik pendant lamps and amazing hand written quotes will make you die for their interiors. They also have a DJ in the house that plays the best of loud music and will make sure your tap to every beat he plays. The amount of food we ordered made us feel as if we were hungry for ages and were only waiting for this day to come soon :-p. Hold back and enjoy the food ride. Our order was masala peanut: this was a mixture of peanut, onions and some tomatoes topped with a little cilantro and some Indian masala's of course. The peanuts were soggy and the crunchiness from this was completely missing, this is not that way love my peanuts, BBQ chicken: Chicken tucked into skewers and topped with coriander and cherry tomatoes was simply a treat for the taste buds. The chicken was juicy, cooked to perfection and the burst of flavors will surely make you want for me as it did to us. Penne alfredo: Rich and creamy pasta topped with olives, cilantro and cherry tomatoes and served with garlic breads on the sides was not as good as I have tasted elsewhere. I guess a little addition of cream cheese to this just might steal the show for them. Chicken lollipop: I would never recommend this to anyone. This was served coated with oil and this wasn't cooked properly either. The chicken was raw from the inside and the tossing of chilly pepper was also not to be seen anywhere. Cheese nachos: Again a very big disappointment this was, the cheese on the top was not melted properly and wasn't spread well either. Topped with jalapenos and cilantro on the top and a sweet and sour dip on the side, this just didn't live up to my expectations. Fish fingers with tartar sauce: Crispy from the outside and cooked well from the inside, I would recommend this dish to everyone visiting here because of the amount of flavors it leaves in your mouth when you dip this with tartar sauce. Paneer tikka: Soft and tender chunks of cottage cheese garnished with coriander leaves and some onions on the side and cooked well from the outside will not make you miss this if you are a vegetarian. Amritsari fish tikka: This again was cooked well from the outside and the juiciness of the fish could be felt with each bite. The green curd chutney needs a special mention here because this was one of the best that I have tasted so far. Chilli chicken: As they say leave the best for the last so here it is. I guess if you are at My Bar and if you don't order this who will never be able to forgive yourself. Tender chicken pieces sauted with onions, bell peppers and cilantro this will get a 5/5 from me for sure. A melt in your mouth dish really. The staff is very confused here may be because of the adrenaline rush this place has. The place might be known for the cheapest daru but will leave a deep hole in your pocket because of the taxes we are paying at the end. (and for that nobody but the government is to be blamed). We end up paying Rs 17526/- for our outing here. Happy eating :)",Rated 3.5,107,2035,??

Udit Batra,"Rated My bar refers to a bar where you can drink and dine at such economic pricing that you feel at home. So this is one is the probably the best branch of my bar keeping in mind the decor,location,food and almost everything is way better than the rest. Being a Sunday evening, we had to wait for about 30 minutes to get a table. So we ordered A classic exotic sheesha 2 pitchers of miller 2 portions of chilly chicken A portion of malai chicken tikka A portion of chicken biryani Extra raita The beer was chilled, what else do you need to say about it. The sheesha was well prepared and the server smilingly changed the coal on request. The chilly chicken tasted good enough to call for a repeat as it had a good quantity of chicken pieces and veggies.@ The malai tikka was somehow a disappointment because it was served cold and lacked texture and the tikka looked somehow raw. The biryani was decent in taste and quantity and the raita too did wonders to the taste of the biryani,texture was well done with the pieces being well marinated.The raita was so good that we ordered for a repeat. All this cost us about 4560/-, which is somehow way expensive for my bar standards but still worth a shot any day.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

RaJat AhuJa,"Rated Ohk MY BAR is back with its another bar in town its the headquarter . I planned a sunday noon to be there with my friends . After waiting for around 40 mins we were given a seat there. As we arived it was totally packed -people celebrating bdays, cricket match lovers and music lovers all together. Ambience a next level to awsumness , loud english music to go with it. We were seated just in front of the music deck and thats the best part going through the menu they have the usual offerings by any club in town but the BIRA beer was heard first time so we decided to order that and ya it wasnt available . So it shouldnt be in the menu . We sat there for about 2 hours and enjoyed the best sunday noon. Despite of such low rates of liquor the thing which pinched our pockets was the sheesha so i guess according the brand name my bar famous for its cheap rates should lower down the price for same .

When we reached , oh yes ! It was packed and despite of our prior booking we had to wait for 40 mins. We got a table near the dj . So the music was too loud but i like loud music . We ordered 2 hookahs , paneer tikkas , chicken masala tikkas , chilly potatoes , malai tikkas and in total 42 pints of kingfisher premium beer . The serving was initially poor , had to tip the waiter so that he sticks around , even he was surprised to take an order for 42 beers , lol ! The food was good and well served , the hookah was not at all good and they dint have more to change them . So 1 point less here .

Waiting for a table is ok, it's understandable and acceptable BUT it's extremely careless of the staff people at the entry to call our name and then within seconds give our table to someone else. Then, we were told that we can sit at the bar. Fine. Finally after some time, me and my friends got a table but then, the service killed the mood. If you can't handle crowd, why accommodate??

We ordered a Shisha, some Starters, and Beer. Beer was really good and served well. Coming to starters, they were under-done. I ordered Dahi-Kebabs for myself, but it was a disaster. Also my friends didn't like it much. And Shisha was such a pain, we were literally going short of breath. First coal replacement is always free, but after the replacement it never worked. We were waiting for the service guys to help us but they were least bothered. We were really calmed and patient and it took nearly 20 minutes for the service guy to reach us. The guy came and replaced the coal again, :( and this was done for exactly 5 times, and guess what....Still No Luck.!!! I think we are just Done with My Bar.

Being a vegetarian, I personally don't know how good chicken tikka was, but I heard it was better than paneer ;). Music : 3.5 They played those evergreen EDM tracks, though I was expecting some new tracks. But anyway, it was not bad. Anything sounds good when you've got your belly full of beer. :D Service : 1 We had to wait for an hour almost, to even place our order. The sheesha guys don't take order for food, food guys dont take order for booze and the booze guys are tough to find. It does test your patience.

But we were served with gravy manchurian.when we told them to change, the staff was adamant that we ordered that only. So we have to order fried rice which took so long that manchurian got cold.

I had ordered Kingfisher strong, Fosters (both 650 ml), 2 Magic moments vodka shot, pizza, peanuts, french fries and I got a bill of Rs. 1300 approx. Inclusive of taxes.

We got off to a very bad start with the music volume. It wasnt just loud, but it was Unbelievably Loud to a point were it gives you a headache in 5 mins...but hey, we wanted to have a good time & went along with it. We ordered food in 3 rounds.. 1st - Chicken Wings, Afghani Chicken & a Beer Tower. 2nd - Chilly Chicken, Chilly Potato, Beer Tower. 3rd - Afghani Chicken, Fried rice, Chicken Manchurian & Chicken Tikka Masala. Now I will be generous and say that the food was good enough on 2 accounts: Taste & Quantity. But the deal breaker was that it was served cold every time around. No, not even warm, simply cold. We wanted to complain but did not because the serving staff wasnt paying enough attention to care, or to be even present in the nearby vicinity.

I couldn't find any major complaints in it. It's a good place to chill out, and it would be easy on your pocket too. I tried their paneer pakora, aloo chaat, nachos and also had the typical north Indian dinner to end my day. The food was delicious. Except for the aloo chaat, which was grossly under seasoned and the nachos which were plain out of the bag when I asked for baked ones, I was quite satisfied with other dishes. My only peeve was that the crowd might seem too rowdy at sometimes. But other than that, it's a pretty informal and laid back place. It's definitely worth a one time visit to see if it suits your taste. Cheers!",Rated 3.5,34,59,??

Then 3-4 waiters began a meeting to find out that which table had actually ordered that dish and a senior level waiter again came to ask if I ordered any chicken dish and again I told the""No"", I just came in. The drinks were as usual at very low prices. Cocktail Drink - My Bar Overdose (don't remember the exact name) was at first a simple coke mixed with lime and just a pinch of vodka.

Dahi k kabab was good too while salt and pepper couldn't please us. Next we ordered veg pasta, Afghani murg along with Electric Blue. I really liked the taste of Electric Blue cocktail.

I spent this weekend there, going there twice in a row with a different group of friends. It has a lively ambience and reasonable priced alcohol. What else do you want to spend a good weekend. I loved their Italian classic pizza. The pasta in white sauce is horrific, but they have decent Chinese dishes. You cannot expect good quality of food where you get cheap alcohol. But to my surprise, the food was good enough. The crowd rushes here even at 2 in the afternoon, which isn't an expected scenario. Therefore you have to bear with long queues.

I have been a regular to my bar for long time now starting from it outlet in paharganj Coming to this place... It one hell of a place The ambiance is modern and totally fits the description of its name perfectly. The place is full of people all the time so I would advise you to be ready to wait for 15-30 minutes. One bit of advice order all your stuff in one go as I think they are a bit understaffed. Coming to food it's excellent from starters to main course especially dahi ke kebab (a must try) As with every other my bar this also has pocket friendly liquor which will. Make smile..

Aditya Vashisth,Rated My bar HQ.. a fine place to end your day... Went to the place for 2 successive weekends and the new bar is pretty Happening.. Key differentiators are space and music... Gives you a feeling of less of a bar..more of a hangout place with friends... Would like to highlight music again.. the new bar is much focussed on EDM... but once in while it shifts focus to 60s 70s rock ..which is a welcome change... To the improvements.. Food is still not to the mark.. but considering Its a value for money place.. pretty much overlooked... Ambience levels are good due to space.. but again can do better...

Ankur Tandon,"Rated Well came here after reading the reviews, expecting it to be a darn good place..BUT, it turned out to be the exact opposite..The only good thing about this place is the size of the hookah..Now moving on to the not so good things- 1. The only type of food that you can served on time is Indian(even that is average)..ordered chilli chicken which turned out to be actually just CHILLI chicken, so much chilli flakes that it would burn your mouth, next came the pepperoni pizza which came in after an hour after we ordered, after we had pestered a dozen servers and even after this wait the pizza that came out was nothing short of pathetic(sweet tomato sauce, pepperoni so less I could count on my fingers) 2. Moving on to the music, these guys say that they play EDM, playing such music people are eating their daal and rotis, isn't exactly the sort of music you would like listening to..even that aside, the music is way too loud. 3. Ambience could be good great if they could dim down the lighting and if the wait staff could be a little more courteous.

Eat..drink..sleep.. Repeat!,"Rated Nice ambiance, average atmosphere but super value for money. The place stands by its claim of being the cheapest (money wise....mind it!) place in cp. I had 4 different cocktails and all of them were outstanding. Food is majorly like a multi cuisine serving what a typical pub offers. Live band adds up to those extra pegs of booze u drink considering its #sasta but karaoke can be painful at times, that's what I am keeping the half mark with me. Don't expect the service to be superlative but that's OK. Manoj the manager is always visible for any out of the box help like I had one.

Joy (livelikejoy.WordPress.com),"Rated One of the most pathetic places with horrible service and bad food n drinks. Not even so cheap as they advertise. Visited this place twice, once on a weekday afternoon and second time on a Saturday night. Both the times found the place very average and mismanaged. They had a long waiting outside on Saturday night which was managed by 2 girls, they were writing down names etc but then there were one manager and be senior looking Sardarji, probably the owner, who were totally ignoring those girls and taking people inside as per their choices. I even raised my concern but those girls outside were helpless. Anyway, after about 30 minutes I got a table for 2 and on several requests someone cleaned the table and then after asking several times we got the menu. By then I was totally pissed. We ordered a few beers n some chicken dishes n a salad. The beers came after about 20 minutes after several reminders and the chicken came after 40 minutes. Beers weren't chilled neither were the glasses. Even the bottle of water we ordered was at room temperature. By then we decided to leave as the evening was completely ruined.",Rated 2.0,49,449,??

It is a classier version with some very tastefully done interiors. Cheap alcohol and good finger food. The paneer tikka and dahi kebab go really well the drinks, especially whiskey and beer.

Deepti Kumra,"Rated ""My Bar"" is a name every dilli wala instantly relates to cheap liquor. With an all new avatar, My Bar has launched their My Bar Headquarters. Its New, its Bigger and its Better. With a huge space and pepped up interiors, my bar headquarters is a more sophisticated version of our Classic my bar in CP and in hauzkhas. It is located above the F-bar and has a wide variety of seating arrangements from normal chairs to high chairs to sofa seating! Service: I would specifically like to point out to the service which is extremely poor. We kept calling the waiter but he was very unresponsive. You see so much staff roaming around but no one to cater to you properly. Food: Chilli Mushroom (3/5): The chilli mushroom were a little hard and too salty. Bbq Chicken (3.5/5): The quantity was extremely poor. Although the taste was fine. Tandoori Chicken Full (4/5): The chicken was masaaledar and tasted and really good. A big turn off to me was their service. But otherwise, this place can be a good hangout joint.",Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Rohit Sen,"Rated The My Bar headquarters is the newest my bar outlet opened quite recently and I will say this is by far the best My bar outlet in town. Trust me when I say this. This is the third outlet of My Bar in CP. I went in here today afternoon(saturday) and had to wait for ten minutes for a table. I could see people waiting for a table and peeps all over the place. It's crowded most of the times and a table is hard to get. I went on a Sunday evening and found that they had a different menu and increased prices. It's located just behind (3 mins walk) the gate number 5/6 of Rajiv chowk Metro Station so reaching and locating this place can never be a problem because of its Central location and my bar brand (ask any one around). The service was slow and I had to wait a lot for the order to be taken initially. There was no draught beer available as usual like in all my bar outlets. I don't know why they even place it in the menu. The Paneer tikka and chilly potato was good enough but tasted a little bland. The place is quite spacious, huge,nicely done and adequately lit. True to the brand this place won't dig a hole in your pocket i.e. is economical to booze with some good music. Ideal for huge gatherings. Definitely Recommended. Though expensive than the other my bars give this place priority over other my bar outlets and I am sure you won't be dissapointed. Also don't give it a second thought going to my bar headquarters if you are in connaught place. Will I be back? Yes obviously as I won't find a better VFM place.

Varun Arora,"Rated This is the third my bar that has opened in the Connaught place area, this one is located near janpath in N block, just above F-bar, nearest metro gate is gate no.6 of rajiv chowk and its pretty easy to find. Since its inception just over a month ago I have been here 4 times already, and you have to visit this place to believe how good it is. Amazing ambiance, the place is huge. The first thing that u see is the bar counter in the middle which gives this place an upmarket look. There is a DJ console too and all the times I have visited the DJ has belted some awesome mixes which make the ambience even more invigorating. Now coming to the menu-the menu is same as any other my bar in cp and voila the prices are same as of now, and as u can expect from my bar they dont pinch your pocket at all. As far the food is concerned, there is not much to write about, just you can order a few snacks to go along with your drinks and nothing more. Another attraction is the hookha they serve here, especially the gun shaped one, quirky naming it ak-47 with flavors like commander, try this just for its uniqueness.. Overall it's the best place to hang out in CP as of now, with such an ambiance my bar is now at par with several more expensive drinking joints in Delhi.",Rated 4.5,12,357,??

For ambiance i would say 4/5, Thats the only thing i liked about My Bar Headquarters. Drinks are cheap no doubt but they should focus on their service more. Can't recommend this to my friends. My rating is 2/5 only because of ambiance otherwise i would rate it 1/5 for food and service!!!",Rated 2.0,14,21,??
Sanjana Dhawan,"Rated Just one word for this place WOW!! Ambience perfect. I ate a lot . So, i started with chilly chicken which was good. Superb taste! Followed with white sauce paste which was plain and dry tasted just OK, pesto chicken was simply a different dish with a yummmy taste and chilly garlic noodles which was again ok! Chicken pakoda was awesome !! Drinks were ok normal like always. Cosmopolitan was a sad part. But with good live music and amazing people as company this place is good. You wouldn't mind spending money!! The total bill was around 3800 which was acceptable as alcohol was also there, that too a lot again :p Service is little slow but never mind , you'll end up having a good time!

Braj Vats,"Rated Spacious !! Really spacious, this is the first thing you 'll notice about the place.. Well planned and organised.. May be the place is less known (This is opened before a month), so you would find more staff than guests on weekdays.

This is a new place and best that my bar franchise has come up with, this place is accessible by the lift and is located on the 2nd floor. Huge area to sit and enjoy your time with friends and girlfriends. The interior used is mostly wooden and the ambience of this place is well designed. You'll feel of visiting a high end bar with great music and bar. They offer beer, cocktails, mocktails and seesha. Their menu contails almost all the drinks with great combo offers. 30ml vodka (magic moments) costs around Rs 54. Its cheap and affordable. They have a smoking zone and do not allow smoking inside the bar premises. We ordered 9 vodka 30ml along with 4 LIIT, it costed us around 1600 which including taxes was 2200.

Karnika Bahuguna,"Rated Don't go there if you want to have a conversation with your companions. The music is really loud. If you are looking for a spacious place with cheap booze and food, loud music and sports channels, then My Bar Headquarters is the place for you. The girl, who was supposed to attend the guests and allot them tables according to requirement, was busy chatting with another guy completely oblivious to the guests. She stopped us midway and asked NOT requested us to walk with her to the reception again so that she could take our name and numbers for database. ( nobody is gonna come back to your rude service, Madam!) Anyway, after getting a table we had to twice ask the waiters who were roaming around to get us a menu. Such is the level of lethargy. We ordered dahi ke shole (kebab), dal makhni, matar mushroom, veg pulao and beer. Also, half of the beers mentioned in the menu were not available so one had to settle down for what was available. The dahi ke kebab were extremely salty with khoya instead of hung curd as stuffing. The rest of the food was okay. To conclude, I'd say that this is not a place to go to for a nice experience. One can just go there to get hammered with cheap booze.",Rated 1.5,15,42,??

Gaurav Khandelwal,Rated Was excited about the place so decided to finally go. The one thing that strikes you as soon as you get in is the huge ambience.. And the great music.. But as you settle down all the charisma is devastated by the long waiting for the waiter to come and take your order. The next thing that strikes you is the amazingly long time it takes them to deliver the same.. It took them more than an hour to get an order of 1 sheesha 2 chilli potato 1 chilli chicken and some shots. Would not like to revisit,Rated 2.5,3,45,??
Ishaan Bhatia,Rated The more I stay in delhi the more i seem to love the huge cafes here...I visited your cafe last evening and by god it is massive...though i would like to notify you about some positives and negatives i would like to say awesomely made.. I am from chennai currently on a holiday here...this my second visit to a cafe in cp and both have been gr8. Please note that your service guys are really really slow like extremely slow. I had to struggle for the order but by the end it was done. Ordered bar b que chicken which was good but I fell the presentation could have been better ( i expected it to be considering the place) . Liquor is super cheap so its worth it for sure. But the best part about ur cafe was the hookah amazingly awesome like excellent I loved it. They made me have this new flavor commisioner i dont no what all was mixed but it was killer. So thimbs up there guys. Music was good but whats disappointing is the crowd. Way to many men inside. Its a suggestion that you should not let so many stags inside it kills the place. Cheerz,Rated 3.5,2,40,??

Alcohol was pretty much average. Hookah well after a very long discussion with the man he still couldn't provide with a good hookah. I definitely have a thing for my bars. Gk & hkv are my choice.

The decor is amazing and moreover the ambience is classy and the songs which DJ plays are the one on which your feet's will surely dance. Now let's hit the food, the food which I ordered was chilly paneer and veg kabab platter something, I don't remember the whole name. Although the food was also nice and it was served hot and yes it was delicious too. Then I liked one more thing, that they guys were serving the hooka on Eiffel Tower. Man it looks damn pretty, although I didn't odered it but still... All over drinks,food and presentation was all good. And yaar obviously the place is deserve to be the best as it is the Headquarters of all the My Bars.. So my experience was good and worthy enough. And will go again for sure.

Chetan,Rated This is the new yet old kid on the block. As most people know my bar is known for its extremely cheap drinks but it's also known for the not so very attractive crowd and ambience but this place changes that. This place is huge but not crowdy at all. The ambience get full points. The music is awesome yet too loud for some people's taste. The service can be a bit better. The menu needs to expand and there were a few times that were not available like all pizza and wings which definitely needs to be changed. The drinks were priced conventionally as needed. The veg salt and pepper didn't taste very good and was a not soggy. Everything else tasted good and was served hot. My new favorite hot spot! Would love to go again and hope the place changes for good.,Rated 4.0,90,652,??

The ambiance here is the best among what I have seen, the seating floor is also the largest one available. Situated just above F bar, it's in fact doing better than the competition. The food & service are beyond mark. The thing is if you want to hang out at CP, this is one of the best spot available.If you visit it evening, this place will give you an entirely different feel.

Anubhav Jain,"Rated As the name suggests this place is the biggest of all the My Bar's, you'll realise that the moment you enter. They have a huge huge bar area with ample of seating space. Bid a visit on a Saturday night due to 45 mins of waiting in vault. So first impression of this place was good and i expected quite a good time. Which to my surprise did not happen. They have untrained staff who keeps on running here and there without doing anything of value. Now they have a console which helps you to ask for service, bill, drinks, or cancelling the order, but i don't see a point of keeping such a thing when there is no one to respond to it even when someone keeps on pressing the buttons for almost half an hour. Coming to the service, i did not get what i ordered for almost 40 mins and on being disappointed and almost leaving the place they come with a order which was not even mine. They literally served us someone else's order just to make us sit. Food quality is pretty much the same as all other my bar instead they don't have half of things on menu available. Pathetic experience. Go there only if you wanna get sloshed as the prices are pretty much same.",Rated 2.5,35,147,??
Akash Gupta,"Rated visited just a week after its opening, this place is best among all the my bar outlets, reasonable liquor and food rates but hukaah is expensive compared to other items on the menu.

Mayank Gupta,"Rated New cafe by Mybar on the second floor of n block cp. As we reached there, the place was full and we had to wait 15-20 mins to get a seat. The ambience is very impressive , spacious place with good and loud music. Till the time I wasn't seated I was expecting a good experience from this place. But as we settled my opinion started changing as the time passed. No attendant came up to us for atleast 15mins after settling to take our order or even to provide the menus. Just when we ordered our first round of food and drinks the lights went off and not just for a couple of minutes . It didn't came for half an hr atleast ; can you just imagine sitting in a cafe with no lights and ventilation for half an hr and top of it they asked everybody not to move from their places . By the end we were almost sweating and when we tried to use the terrace for some air the management didn't let us by saying you can't go anywhere tll the lights are back. We were sitting on our chairs like we are trapped somewhere with nothing to eat and drink on our table. The service was also pathetic. We had to ask for our order again and again. They took so much time that we were in second thoughts that ll We be able to enjoy our food and drinks or not. Sheesha was also not nicely done and we literally had to chase the sheesha guy for the relights. Talking about food - we ordered kebab platter, chilli paneer, peanuts , tandoori chicken, chilli potatoes. Everything was very ordinary . No special presentation . Pizzas are not available But still on the menu. Though the prices are reasonable but the serving is not enough. Music was too loud that you can barely listen to the person next to you . An if you decide that lets just enjoy the music and dance then you are wrong again because the moment you ll get out of the seats for it you ll be asked to be seated and dance there only ; like how can someone dance while seating. If it not allowed then why was the music loud enough that your washroom doors were also vibrating. They really need to learn how to attend their customers. Not going here again..!! P.s : Go to this place if you are looking for cheap booze and can bare rudeness. My Ratings Ambience : 3.5/5 Food : 2/5 Price : 3.5/5 Service : 0.5/5",Rated 2.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Sumanyu Jain,"Rated First of all kudos to my bar for opening third outlet in the circle. Undoubtedly their best and overall one of the biggest single floor outlets in the area. Located adjacent to f bar in n block, second floor the place captured u with its ambience right from the entrance. You are welcomed by a beautiful attendant. Next thing you look at is the big big seating arena that includes a bar at the center, lounge seating, dinner seating, beer counter, smoking zone and an excellent EDM. Coming to food and drinks We ordered 12 peg combo of antiquity. Pasta, chilly potatoes and paneer tikka. I was a bit disappointed with the service. We had to remind them twice or thrice to bring the drinks. After waiting for abt 30 mins chilly potatoes were served and were cold. We returned them and they came with a fresh plate. Garlic bread served with pasta was a pao used in pao bhaji !!!! Overall taste was just about okay. Probably result of low cost servings. The feel of the place is excellent. Crowd from all ages will find themselves comfortable here. Right from teenagers to office goers to 40 plus, just everyone. One suggestion - do not let the low cost factor compromised with quality of food and service. If people are attracted by the cost factor they should also be delighted by the good quality.
