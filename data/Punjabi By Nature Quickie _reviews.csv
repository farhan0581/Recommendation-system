Nishant Tyagi,"Rated So we went there, ordered few items which were very costly Then in the bill which i didnt see there they have charged 190 rupees for 2 bottles of WATER on 17 feb and where on earth do u find such costly water which was a normal bottle by the way",Rated 1.0,1,1,??
The Burping Soul,"Rated Punjabi by nature is in the F block of the circle beside several other popular eating joints yet it doesn't miss the mark. The interiors are cozy and beautiful with a wall fountain flowing giving the place a high end look. Full during the lunch hours it offers a wide variety of Indian-(Punjabi to be specific)food.You have an option for Thalis as well, which includes a snack, dal, sabzi, rice, salad, raita, gulab jamun and a piece of bread-enough for a single person.When not in a mood of thali one can choose from the exquisite variety of menu, from chole bhatures to Mughlai chicken all are delicious and upto the mark. Not overpriced in comparison to other restaurants in Connaught Place, The price is justified with the taste they offer. It is a good place to go when you don't feel like sitting in a cafe or searching for a place in CP.",Rated 3.5,3,0,??

Prateek Sharma,"Rated Punjabi By Nature began its culinary journey in Noida around 15 years back but for several years it's most famous outlet was the one in City Square Mall in Rajouri Garden. Later, outlets came up in Vasant Kunj, Vasant Vihar, Gurgaon and Connaught place. This one is not a full- fledged Express PBN restaurant. It's a smaller version which justifies the title Quickie. Ambience- 3.5/5 It's a well lit restaurant with very simple interiors and comfortable seating. As compared to it's other lavish counterparts, this one is smaller in size but can easily accomodate more than 10 groups at a time. I had a little chat with one of the staff members as i was curious to know the reason why PBN decided to come up with a smaller version of their legendary food chain in that part of the city where it would do brisk business and i got to know that this was established keeping in mind the corporate culture of CP. Since corporates have time limitations so everything has been toned down from prices to the time taken in delivery and service. Menu- 5/5 They have done total justice to the concept of this place. Without creating a mess, they have kept the menu short and crisp. Many Appetizers and Main Course dishes that are part of their menu in other outlets are not served here. PBN is known for their brutally expensive rates and large portions but this one is an exception The prices are almost half of every dish served here alongwith the portions. Food- 4/5 They serve lip smacking North Indian Appetizers and Main Course dishes, Chaat delicacies like Sevpuri, Paani puri etc which are every Delhiite's delight, Kebabs, breakfast snacks like Cholle bhature, Paav Bhaaji etc and even Burgers and Pizzas. We tried few items. will be given to DESI HABSHI'S most loved items. 1. Sev Puri- Little Gol Gappas stuffed with Curd, tangy chutneys, finely chopped veggies and topped with bhujia namkeen and pomegranate seeds. 2. Dhai bhalle Paapdi - Another Chaat item which was presented beautifully. It's hard to expect authentic taste of these items at a fine dining restaurant but PBN exceeded our expectations. 3. Veg Kabab Platter- I would highly recommend this as it can be a proper meal for one instead of going for the regular thaalis (deluxe etc). It comprised of two pieces each of Tandoori Paneer tikka, Stuffed Aalo, Dahi ke kababs and one bowl Dal makhani with a portion of Butter Naan. I have never had any main course item in a platter anywhere else. Tandoori Aaloo were delicious. Stuffed with Paneer, they were the highlights of this platter. Dahi kababs were stuffed with very sweet yogurt which didn't please our taste buds. Paneer Tikka was good but not exceptional. 4. Non-Veg Kebab platter- My fellow foodies had it and loved it to the core. Comprised of 3 Non-veg Appetizers alongwith Dal makhani and a piece of Butter Naan. 5. Murgh Makhani- My foodie friends loved this as well. No complaints. 6. Paneer Tikka Pizza- I am a pizza fanatic. As soon as i saw this on the menu, i couldn't control my urge to order one and it was fabulous. Crispy base topped with loads of Mozerella cheese and Veggies. It was awesome. 7. Paav Bhaaji- This was the only dissappointment that evening. The bhaaji lacked flavours and spices. 8. Sweet lassi Overall, the food was awesome and cooked perfectly in a limited time. Service- 5/5 The captions were very prompt. Just loved the way they were attending the customers. It is one area that really pushes me to give brownie points. It's a nice fine dining option for those running out of time. Try it at least once.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Anchal Saxena,Rated Nice place to visit wid friends and family ....nice food ....best one to try and go for is express thali 1....peshawri kebabs were too good nd so mutton curry.

Shakti Nayan,"Rated I don't know if anyone has actively mentioned this as a 'budget restaurant"" but well I'm ready to throw in the exception. Bit of a relief for poverty stricken college guys who skip an outlet because of the location and ""cost for two"". I ordered some starter consisting of veg kebabs, dahi kebabs and galouti. Also, I ordered 2 express thali one for veg and non veg. for some reason the food is deliciously stomach filling and makes you feel full and it is a challenge to reach food in every corner of the plate. As for the taste, the food is fresh and richly flavored. Right balance of salt and sugar I would say. The staff is very responsive! kudos to the ambiance! The bill was just Rs.1078 for lots of stuff in a thali! They also offer street food which is a plus 1! Would love to visit this place soon :)",Rated 4.0,28,166,??

Kababs were fine, dal and naan were good, but surprised that chutney given along was stale and smelling and had to ask them to change. For main course ordered dal makhani, Lahori Paneer and Chole bhature. Though the main dishes were fine, chole bhature were very disappointing. Overall average experience.",Rated 2.5,6,0,??

Girija Suri,"Rated We ordered Dahi Ke Kabab, Non Veg Galauti Kabab and Tandoori Paneer Tikka for starters. For the main course, we tried Dal Makhani, Lahori Paneer Masala (basially Karahi Paneer as the staff explained us) and Pindi Cholle. With a place offering a very limited menu as this one, one usually expects each dish to be bang on. However, we were left wanting for that extra punch in each of the dishes and none of them could actually cut the mark. Lahori Paneer was tasty but more on the sweeter side and hence not that authentic for a karahi paneer dish. Pindi Cholle were the best of the lot and i do feel their Cholle Bhature are a must try (they serve a family size fluffy bhatura which looks extremely yummy). Dahi ke Kabab was dripping with dahi and i suppose one would not really want to be getting too literal with the names of the dishes. Paneer tikka was average. Non veg galauti kabab was quite satisfying. It has a nice ambiance for family dinners though!",Rated 3.5,25,56,??
Gurneet Kaur,"Rated I have been a regular customer at the Punjabi by Nature outlets for their delicious Punjabi food and vodka golgappe. When PBN opened its outlet vin F block CP, I wasn't sure of the word 'quickie' attached to its name and the changes it'll bring. Well. The food is priced cheaper and the menu has a variety of quick meals making your job easier. The menu includes ala carte but also these thalis covering a variety of dishes from the menu. We were here for a really quick dinner and enjoyed most of what was served to us. We ordered the veg kebab platter which was more than enough for one. So order accordingly. The dal Makhani was delicious along with the the naan. Also on the platter was paneer tikka which was seasoned well, the tandoori aloo were my favorite on the platter. The dahi k kebab were prepared very well but the dahi was too sour for my liking. This meal costed us 245 rupees only so yes value for money is 5/5. The service was super quick. I wish the staff was a little friendly. Being the peak Time, they were in a hurry to make us eat and leave. Twice they came to clear out plates while we were still eating. Not cool! You will see people of all age groups enjoying a meal here but be ready to wait for a table during dinner time.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Kanwar Anand,"Rated The seats are awkwardly close, the waiters touch your arm when serving cause its so compact, the cutlery is of poor quality and the tables are below ordinary. This is more of a dhaba than a full fledged establishment and the service is one reason I say so. To add to this, the place was ridiculously warm when I went 2 months back and despite me asking them to switch the AC on, nothing at all happened. You see, there are places where if you make a suggestion, it is perhaps heard and received and then there are places where the service staff makes you feel like, you're doomed buddy, we are not the kind of staff to listen, it is a bit too advanced for us. This belongs to the category of restaurants that will end up ruining your evening especially if you decide to come here in numbers. Do yourself a favour and go anywhere else. The food was hapless to add. I ordered butter chicken and some paneer, it was quite bad. Barely edible so I ate just one half of a naan, went to some other place and ordered a drink. I needed one after the poor quality and outdated treatment at this particular Punjabi By Nature. We all love Indian food but the service should also be excellent or at least bearable. Why go all the way to CP to visit this branch? I will give just 2 stars because it deserves nothing more. How many were we? About 18 including kids (on a separate table)",Rated 2.0,129,365,??
Barkha Handa,Rated Quickie doesnt mean its a kiosk. It is a full-fledged restaurant with good seating area available. It was quite late for our dinner and still this place was handsomely crowded. We ordered butter chicken which my husband loved badly but I found it just okay and the butter naans were good and soft. The Dal makhani was the center of attraction. It was properly spiced up and I ate it like completely. It also has a well-organized service which impressed me greatly. So I would definitely recommend this place to all my foodie friends.,Rated 4.0,19,52,??

Dahi Ke Kabab was hero among all... nice soft in taste....had all required flavours Dal Makhani was no doubt exceptionally best in taste...although quantity was less but i can give full points on taste.... a must try :D 3.Veg Biryani--->Rice were cooked in the perfect way...had good fusion of vegetables...tasted a little dry to me. 4.Butter Paneer Roll---> Loved this dish as well...Fillings were tasty properly cooked paneer made it the valuable dish.. a must try.. :D 5.Chatpata Tawa Paneer Burger---->The presentation of this dish was unique...served with potatoes wedges..burger was normal in taste..nothing special 6. Mango lassi----> lassi is my favourite...and Punjabi By nature served it in the best way..loved the chilling and refreshing taste of mango. 7.Aam Panna---->Tangy in taste...which is an obvious flavour of aam panna... 8.Classic Mojito---> Again a drink which had expected taste...nothing new in the flavours 9.Oreo Choco Shake---> was best among the beverages...again liked the presentation of the shake...taste was awesome chocolaty.. a must try :D Overall---- A good looking restaurant with cool decor...polite staff and awesome food..yes they also serve some dishes which are not up to the mark,but it is worth visiting this place for any occasion. :D",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Courteous staff. Refused underage drinking - and I appreciate this. Most of the things we ordered were good - butter paneer roll was the highlight. A complete bite! Kebab platter was a nice assortment but not too good to be shared among more than 2 people, since it contains only 2 peices each of paneer tikka, dahi kabab etc apart from 1 naan nd dal makhni. But it was value for money and taste was good. Biryani was good taste wise and quantity wise but was a bit dry. Could have tasted better with something like curd. Pao bhaji was not too good. Bhaji was extremely ordinary. Liked the presentation of the chatpata tawa paneer burger. Taste was ok. Liked the veggies it came with. Great experience overall!",Rated 4.5,11,3,??

Vijayant Khanna,Rated I went there with a bunch of friends and we all were too hungary. We started with the dahi kebabs and the paneer tikka. The starters were good. They served them with green chutney and onions. The chutney and the masala sprinkled over the onions were really nice. Then we ordered choley bhature. They got us the bhatura first on the table and we were like boss itna bada bhatura ?. Choley were good but ..overall choley bhature were normal in taste but the size of the bhatura's is too big. Since we were too hungary we then ordered some main course. For main course we had dal makhni and lahori masala paneer with lacche paranthe and butter naan. Both the dishes were full in flavour..the paneer's gravy and an amazing and different kinda taste. The butter naan's are too good. And the place isnt that heavy on pocket.

It is a compact yet spacious restaurant .It was crowded as expected on Sunday evening. Talking about the food, the menu is very limited. I wish there were more options to choose from. I had very few options . I ordered Burger but 5 mins after taking my order they informed me that there are no Burgers for now. Then ordered Express thali 6 . Absolutely delectable and perfect North Indian Platter. The Lahori paneer had that authentic flavour . It had those perfect blend of spices that made me feel the real flavours of Lahore.

Also, we arrived at 1 30 PM famished both having missed their breakfast on a Sunday. Its located right near Rajiv Chowk metro Gate no. 6. The ambience is pretty with artificial waterfall welcoming you. The place has some beautiful pantings and the seating is comfortable. You can enjoy your meal on the couch if you are a group. Coming to the food, we ordered 2 all time favorite items- Plain naan and a Paneer Makhani. The order arrived within 10 minutes which was a welcome respite. They serve the naans here in a single large triangular shape and not cutting it into smaller pieces like the restaurants in eastern India do. Right from the aroma of the dish, I could make out it was going to be special. And I wasnt proved wrong. The naan was the softest yet crispy flaky at places and dunked into the makhani , it was a pleasure. The Paneer was soft , fresh and juicy and the gravy was really wonderful. It had the right texture and flavors were well balanced. It was buttery and had flavors of tomato,cream,and garlic in the perfect proportion.This is how a makhani should be cooked.I thouroughly enjoyed the meal and I can always go back here for the same food.",Rated 4.0,66,358,??

Kumar Ankush,"Rated For my birthday, I wanted to go to a special place and a new one. Initial thoughts were to try out ITC maurya, but after much deliberation and checking my bank account multiple times, I settled down at this place. The service and ambience of the place is amazing, was greeted by a cheerful manager, the staff was cordial and helpful. The artificial waterfall and the carefully selected furniture make this place a treat for the eyes. I went there with my parents and they were impressed with the decorations and the ambience. We ordered exotic non veg and veg thalis, dahi ke kabab, lassi for my parents and virgin mojito for me. The drinks were perfect, couldn't expect better. The dahi ke kebabs were juicy and delicious, however the texture could have been a little better. I would have given this place 4 stars or even more, but I am not, only because the food was too spicy, some people might argue that Punjabi food is ""spicy"" and this is not a valid reason to deduct any points, but trust me, I know my curries and my kebabs, the food was way more spicy for traditional Punjabi cuisine. It was aromatic, visually appealing and tasted good, but could have been heavenly if the chef had used lesser number of chillies. The ""Gulab Jamun"" included in the thali was clearly a lazy piece of work. It did not taste great, texture was not inviting and overall wasn't worth it. Tip to management: Ask the customers before you serve the food whether they want their food enormously spicy or not. Also, please improve the sweets guy.",Rated 3.5,35,196,??

Anyway the food however decent to say the least. The Dahi ke Kebab were the best thing we had that night. The Kasturi Chicken Kebab was decent too. The Mutton and Chicken main courses were to heavily spiced for my taste with a very strong aroma of the spices. Liked the Missi Roti and Paratha though.

And, the Express thali had papad, kebab, salad, dal makhni, paneer makhni, vegetable raita, a naan, rice, and a gulab jamun. So, I did not really like the paneer makhni. It was too sweet for me. Rest everything was fine. Decent! Ambiance - 6/10 Service - 8/10 Food - 7/10 Suggestion - they could have different types of paneer in the express thaali 's like kadhai paneer and paneer lababdar.

They have a very selective menu..as the name of the place suggests 'Quickie'. Instead of going for the a la carte we ordered veg thalis. Precisely thali no 5,6 and 8. Amongst all the thalis we collectively gorged on, I found there veg seekh kebabs as most sumptuous. Galauti kebabs were also very good. I found the daal makhni (common in each thali) as very average. Wonder how so many people have liked it so much. Paneer makhni was very sweet but eatable. And lahori paneer masala was your typical kadhaai paneer,which personally I don't like much. Rice was plain and simple. Raita was good although a tad too sour. And to end the meal there was a hot gulab jamun in each thali. All in all the food was good and sufficient for one person considering you pay Rs299+ taxes for each thali.

I went there along with 2 frnz, and the bill was just 850/-. Their chole bhature are the best I ever tasted. Light and soft. On the other hand, the tandoori alloo r perhaps the worst. Stuffed with raisins and cashews(both of which i happen hate, especially in their cooked form. This gave them a sweeter taste) and each piece was rolled in sesame seeds. The food on the whole is normally spiced without burning your pallette or stomach for that matter. Serving sizes are great.

Sharad Mahajan,"Rated I always wanted to try this restaurant as it somehow used to attract me whenever I would cross from Janpath to the CP inner circle. I went here on a Sunday night.. I waited for about half an hour to get a table which I thought was due to it's great popularity.. The ambience was OKish type with average interiors.. we ordered veg thalis for 2. I had been to PBN in Noida and liked it big time due to it's food and quantity they serve. However, it was quite an opposite experience this time around with PBN quickie. In short the food was tasteless!! We ended up paying 900 for 2 veg thalis. To be honest the food wasn't worth even a single penny. I wasted myself in this restaurant on a Sunday night. I will probably not even go to the regular PBN restaurants after this incident.",Rated 2.0,4,23,??

KandwalSaab,"Rated A nice family restaurant with our northIndian Punjabi treats. The Glass n water they served had some unwated objects though they chnaged this but such mistakes are not acceptable and thus would rate a bit less. We personally loved the GolGappaas served with 4/5 waters- AamPanna,Jaljeera etc. I would advise to go for the Thali option rather than ordering for separate servings.

The express thali concept works wonder if you don't want to spend much and still have a stomachful of delicious stuff. Non veg : go for thali combo 1. And veg go for thali combo 5 ( I have tried almost all and these are my favorite ones.. Urs might differ) The service is fast and they maintain hygiene aptly. Try their golgappe plate.. Though I can never get enough of the quantity the shots (no no its not alcohol) are pretty amazing. Cons : they never make reservations. It's first come first serve basis. In weekends if you go between 8-10 pm, the waiting time could be as much as one hour. So that's a glitch if you are in for a hurry.",Rated 4.0,17,24,??

I happened to order a kebab platter, which is not an out-of-the-world experience but yes, it stands average on the mughlai tastes meter, and a biryani, the quantity is wholesome. One, will very easily feed two hungry people. Taste, again, gives you a typical mughlai experience. These two things plus a coke costed me about 700 rupees, which I wouldn't say was a bad deal.

Vaibhav Aggarwal,"Rated Although the name has 'Quickie' in it, it seems a little ironical. I say that because, firstly, the ambience is quite nice, which one doesn't generally expect when the restaurant name suggests that; secondly, the service isn't anything quick, it's decent, and for some it may even be slow. As I have already suggested, the ambience is quite nice. I tried their 'Murg Makhani' (Butter Chicken) and 'Murgh Punjabi Masala' (Karhai Chicken). I didn't like their Karhai Chicken, but their Butter Chicken was really nice. Also, initially the potions seemed quite small, considering the prices also, one realized that it's good that they've kept it that way because it doesn't get wasted even if there are less people, and price wise it's quite decent. Their butter naan was also nice. The service needs to improve a little though.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Amit Sikdar,"Rated What's the meaning of excellent ambiance and prompt service in a restaurant that has average food?? In my mind, nothing. Restaurants are meant to serve delicious food. Everything else is an add-on. Very average Meat Punjabi by Nature, equally mediocre Chicken Punjabi, similar views about the Paneer Lahori Masala. That's why the restaurant deserves a 3 on a 5 point scale. Why have I given it a 3.5? Well, the Daal Makhani was great and saved the day for the outlet. Service and ambience is top-class. But that's an add-on and can't make-up for bad food. Haji Shabrati ki Nihari ki Dukaan has no frills and can be called dilapidated.

To start of with the entrance itself was impressive.. Ambience good - feel good factor! The waiter attending to us was meek & didn't quite know about the menu. He called on to another guy who suggested Non Veg Kebab Platter ( which has an assortment of 2 pcs each - 4 types of kebabs + Dal Makhani + tandoori naan) & Murg Masala. Kebabs were soft & delicious.. Dal makhani very tasty. Murg masala typical home made style. The only negative point would be that this restaurant does not serve anything boneless...

One point I will raise is that we came in expecting to spend 800 bucks for two as it says on the page, we but ended up spending 1k per person.

It became mandatory for us to order extra chhole which was charged for. 1 plate of chhole bhatura costed rs 160 and extra chhole costed us rs 75. So if u order chhole bhature don't be fooled by the price on the menu. You would ultimately have to pay 235rs not inclusive of tax. The quality of the food was good.

I ordered nonveg thali and was sad to see the serving size - more of rice and less of gravy and kebabs. Secondly, the place is very small to accommodate all crowd that turns up there.

Tandoori Salad was a tandoori version of fruit salad. We didnt like it much as it was the combination of apples, pears, pineapple The flavor for all the fruits was same and the salad had too many spices, which were nor required. Amritsari Chhole Bhature tasted good. The plate had a huge bhatura, which was sufficient for two people but the quantity of chhole was too less. I complained about it to the Manager and he mentioned that he gets the same complain everyday then why he is not working on it, I dont get it.

Though it certainly needs to do more to increase its visibility instead of just a sign because it isn't exactly right on the path and the footage is also taken away by Nando's to some extent. The place only has the leverage of its name. Coming to food, this place is a good option for all those who want a filling meal. The menu can have new additions though. We ordered lassi, lahori masala paneer and tandoori roti. Paneer was fairly normal. Nothing too special. Infact the taste of almost all the dishes is pretty average considering the fact that it is a prime location based food joint. But then, you would not regret spending money.

KR,Rated This is a decent place serving North Indian food. I've tried their vasant vihar outlet. It wasn't very good and was expensive too. But this one is good and plus very quick for office lunches. Price is ok. I mean thali for say 400 including taxes. But what I like is their veg kebabs platter. Dahi ke kebab is gud n Dal makhni n naan is served with platter I think which is gud. I found it better than thali. Non veg is also fine. But maybe coz nowadays I'm not enjoying non veg food so it could be coz of dat. But I can say this much dat food wasn't bad which again is not quite a guarantee these days no matter wat money it costs. But I guess ppl going for a sumptuous meal can try thali also. Service is fine. Why I liked place is coz though being slightly expensive its atleast good North Indian food specially gud dal makhni.

Neeraj & Shraddha Naik,"Rated Having read good reviews about this hotel, we had shortlisted this on our visit list when we were in New Delhi. We were traveling in a big group and were looking for multiple cuisine restaurant (here they serve kebabs,curries, south indian and Thalis). The ambience and the outlook is nice and clean. The multiple mirrors gives the restaurant a bigger look. We tried mix of North and South Indian food. What we tried Masala Dosa & Onion Masala Dosa - Nice and crisp dosa served with potato vegitable. The only difference between Onion masala dosa and regular masala dosa was addition of onions. Idli - Hot to serve but not very soft. Medu wada - By far the best medu wada that we have had. Perfectly fried for the crisp outer layer and inside the wada is soft but cooked perfectly. All the south Indian dishes are served with 3 chutneys (coconut, coriander and tomato of which the coconut one is to die for) and sambar (full of veggies not to spicy and not to tangy just perfect to eat your dosa and idli with). Veg kebab platter - When we read about the dish in the menu we were quite excited but sorry to say was little disappointed with the dish as we found the potions being less for a platter. The platter includes Tandoori Paneer Tikka (disliked the quality of paneer as it was little hard to eat), Tandoori Aloo (decent to taste) and Dahi ke Kebab(liked it,well made) served with dal makhani and Naan. Lassi - Nice thick curd lassi perfectly sweetened. Chicken chettinad - This dish was served with malabar paratha. The taste was quite ok but a little disappointing. Veg biryani & Chicken Biryani- Both were well prepared but was not special. Overall the experience was good.The only dissatisfaction is in the terms of potions i.e.small options as compared to the price. The staff is very hospitable and affable. Service is decent but can be more smiling towards customer. Wonder whether it is the Delhi effect.

Had dahi ke kebab and haryali kebab for starters. And they were melting in the mouth. For main course ordered dal Makhani and kadhai paneer and boy that was also really really yumm.

Since it was a weekend, we had to wait a bit for our table which is perfectly allright since the food and the service make up for the wait. The place has nice ambience which is a perfect balance of modern and traditional in the sense that whatever your age be, you are gonna love the ambience. The staff is very courteous and is prompt with the service without actually hovering over your head constantly, which is a great thing. The food, needless to say is pretty amazing. The dahi bhalla papdi chat is pretty good, and the potato crispers on top add a yummy crunch to the dish. We ordered seperate thalis for ourselves and it was a very filling meal. The only tiny thing being that for the thali, the quantity of the daal is a little less in proportion to the rice. And the quantity is good, considering we could not finish our thalis to the last bite. You just cannot eat it to the last bit.!! Will love to visit again and try seperate order.!! P.S: express thali 2 was better over express thali 1. The chicken was juicy and tender in both though. The gravy was much better on 2.

We ordered a mango lassi which was totally yum and had original mango flavor unlike many other places wherein they mix some weird flavors which do not even justify the product.. We also tried dahi ke kebab which were totally awesome..!! Soft from the inside and crisp from the outside, this was like a perfect vegetarian starter anyone could order..!! In the main course we tried Tawa Vegetables with Masala Okra, which was kind of a semi-dry gravy dish. The taste was really good..!

Sankalp Sharma,"Rated Punjabi by nature has always stood apart from the crowd. The Punjabi by nature Quickie outlet is also one with class. Mirrored walls, life sized paintings , beautiful lighting and fountain at the entrance instantly attracts you to this place. Meticulously dressed tables with napkin rings make a fine dining experience. We ordered a non Veg kebab platter, Amritsari choley bhaturey and an express thali #2. A single humungous Bhatura was server with a portion of choley which was relatively less. The choley were amazing with unique masalas enriching the flavor.The impressive size of the bhatura is why the dish is so popular here but I wouldnt recommend it as the bhatura was oily and plain. The combo came set in the plastic plate with a wooden base. It had peshawari kebab, murgh makhani, dal makhini, rice, salad, papad, a plain naan and a gulab jamun. The chicken meat was a bit tough but the gravies, especially the murg makani was delectable, and again i wish the naan was butter naan but I managed. The kebab platter was the best of the lot with 2 pieces each of Peshawari kebab, Reshmi seekh kebab and malai seekh, a sumptuous bowl of dal makhini and a Plain Naan. I wish the Naan was butter naan coz it went cold by the time we finished half of it.The mutton was good enough, the succulent Reshmi seekh being a the best out of those. The Dal Makhini was worth mentioning, simply ambrosial.",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Pranshu Shaw,"Rated A great place at Cannouggt Place to experience a fine dining. The restaurant looks very classy and elegant and makes an impression of being very expensive, but after looking at the menu and their prices I can say that it was a wrong impression altogether. The restaurant is average priced with a great service and even great ambiance. The menu made me confused to order so I took the safe side and ordered for thali. Tried 4 varieties of thalis and trust me i didn't regret over a single dish other than the dal makhni. The thaki portion size is good and enough for 1 person to dine. I specially liked the presentation of thali which makes you feel you have ordered a great deal. The service is very prompt. Altogether a very nice experience to dine.

Scorp4u265,"Rated before i write or say anything, just remember that the taxes are 30% of the whatever bill you make. i paid 1000 for a bill of 3000. just a plain reason for thinking twice about going back. other restaurants charge somewhere between 12-15%. the liquor is just over priced. means you have to give a gold ring for selling to repay even if you take 2 friends along. mood got wasted!!! i wondered may be we were getting served beer in a dry zone. food: though meat was great, the paneer makhani was chuna to your taste buds. okay for garlic roti, but for plain naan it was like rubber. fish was really great but simply overpriced. and the chicken tandori was fine. service was okay and typical small type restaurants atmosphere. in short, if you hate crowds then it s a good choice. but if your pocket pinches, then definitely a no-go, the taxes will kill you before you recover.-1 for taxes -1 for beer overpricing -1 for (-0.5 for good food but over priced, -0.5 for rubberistic naan and panner chuna) +1 for less crowd +1 for service was fine, washroom was clean, meat and fish was good only.",Rated 2.0,1,0,??
Rajat Dhingra,"Rated This place is a nice option if you're looking for a restaurant for a lunch/dinner with family or you want to eat good food in a fancy restaurant at reasonable prices! The interior and decor is minimal yet pleasant. Some of the furniture pieces needs to be changed. 2 out of 8 chairs on which we were seated were either broken or something else was wrong with them. They were changed immediately on our request. For starters, we ordered Veg Platter, Paneer Tikka, Aloo Tikka, Galouti Kebab and Reshami Chicken Kebab. In the platter they served Paneer Tikka, Dahi Kebab, Aloo Kebab and Dal Makhani with Butter Nan. Paneer Tikka and Aloo tikka were best. Did not like Galouti Kebab and Dahi ke Kebab. Reason being they were serve cold and taste was not really pleasing. Reshami Kebab were average. For Main Course, Dal Makhani and Lahori Paneer Masala were ordered along with Chapatis and butter naan. Dal makhani was delectable and on the other hand Lahori Paneer Masala was a disappointment as it was not supposed to be sweet but spicy! Fresh Lime Soda and Aam Panna plus two aerated drinks from the beverages section. Both were good in taste. But again they didn't put ice cubes in any of the drinks. Ice cubes were put on request. I don't know how did they do it but they did screw up things in a balanced manner or maybe it was our order which coincidentally made every screw up balance a thumbs up! Bill was 4012 exact! In the end I'd like to point out a few things 1. Menu is very limited. Like really limited. Maybe the concept 'Quicke' limits it. 2. Service is really slow. 3. Calm and quiet atmosphere to dine in (Positive) Rating it 4 because Dal Makhani was really amazing!",Rated 4.0,40,191,??

The platter contains Paneer tikka, tasted normal, dahi kabab, it was good, presentation was nice. Then it was time for Thali to taste it contains Lahori masala paneer and by looking at it, it was giving me the feeling of baingan ka Bharta and valla it tasted the same. We ordered the naan. Then asked them to put butter on it and in this process the naan became cold and they didnt even bothered to change it. Now I started with rice till 2-3 bites it was fine, but after that the rice was uncooked at the bottom. I told the stuff about this and he replied sir, you have eaten it you should have told us before. And I was thinking how on earth without eating I can tell the rice was not cooked.

False ceiling, textured walls and huge blow ups of their own preparations that would look out of place separately but dashed together with finely dressed tables complete with napkin rings relect the rich culture. We ordered a non veg kebab platter, Amritsari choley bhaturey and express thali #2. The kebab platter came beautifully plated with 2 pieces each of Peshawari kebab, Reshmi seekh kebab and malai seekh, a bowl of dal makhni and a plain naan. The meat was just decent, the succulent Reshmi seekh being a clear favourite. The thick creamy dal was ambrosial, one of the best I have had. Known for its huge breads, the magnanimous bhatura with the portion of choley which was relatively less. The impressive size of the bhatura is why the dish is a hot seller because thee bread was otherwise slightly greasy. The choley were nice with light masalas enhancing the flavours. The combo too came perfectly fit into a wooden tray with peshawari kebab, murgh makhani, dal makhani, rice, salad, papad, a plain naan and a gulab jamun. The meat again was a bit tough but the gravies, very palatable.

JAI SAMRAT SINGH,"Rated Punjabi by Nature has been one of the fine restaurants in Delhi when you want to look at something truly Punjabi. I have been been to the quickie joint thrice and experienced quality quotient being receding every time. What i like about this place is the price factor as it is clearly cheaper than main Punjabi by Nature branches being more pocket friendly. Dishes that I recommend : Chicken kastoori kebab: succulent and flavoursome, its one dish that comes highly recommended. Meat Punjabi by nature : its one dish that really is lovable to your taste buds and the cinnamon flavour accompanied with the meaty flavour does a good job. However the hyped ones are Raan-e-Punjab and Biryani didn't do much justice to the fame of this place. Ambience of this place is just average, however its relieving to drop in here after some serious CP shopping.

We were 8 of us and paid just over 600 per person, with all of us ordering a thali each and some of us even having beers. Although, I prefer the non-veg platter over the thali. The 'quickie' concept does translate into swift service but has no negative impact on the taste of the food, which is great. Decor is pleasing but be ready to wait if you are visiting in peak weekend hours. Will return soon.",Rated 4.0,23,183,??
DJ911,Rated After having a very bad experience of try Thali here I thought i would never visit this one again but luck was trying me. Pind balluchi was having long wait on weekend due to renovation on upper floor and craving for Indian food and visitors with me I had no other choice. From past experience one thing i was pretty sure that i do not have to order thali(it was indeed a great decision). As name says its a quickie so having limited options. I visited at saturday on 8PM and was lucky enough to get table for 8 without waiting(more than one hour wait in Pind Balluchi). One good thing of having small Menu is you don not have to think much and it took hardly 2 mins to order. Starters were served within 10 mins and this time every thing was perfect. In non veg tandoor chicken and Malai kebab. Veg I settled for dahi k kebab. Main course was also good. If someone is looking for real spicy thingy in veg do order lahori paneer masala. So here's my revaluation for this one. Taste:- 3.5/5 Ambience:- 3/5 VFM:- 3.5/5,Rated 3.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Abhilasha Aggarwal,"Rated After catching up a movie, we were trying to figure out as to which would be the best place to make the evening ""well spent"" and that's when we discovered Punjabi by Nature Quickie... We were a group of 4 and each one of us was excited about the idea.... It was a waiting of almost 20-25 minutes (which we did not mind as we were just focusing on food).... We entered and were pleased with the nicely done interiors... the menu came... wanst very elaborate but then we took it for a ""Quickie""menu and ordered... The others in the group were pretty excited for the Dahi ke Kebab which turned out to be quite a disappointment.... One has had much better ones that too at some nondescript places... Even the rest of the order was unappealing... To top it all... my five year old (foodie) doll complained... ""mom, why did you choose to come here....""and coz I did not have any answers myself...

Samay Thapa,"Rated Visited this one last night with friends for a small get together. My friends were tight with budget and since it was a pool in get together i chose this place to sit (checked on zomato). Since i had this knowledge that they do not have Bar i thought it would be okay as none of my friends wanted to drink anything. But to my surprise they do serve Beer, Breezer and Few other drinks (except for Rum and something else). Lets talk about the ambience- Well to me it was just above average as it does not give you a feeling of a full time restaurant. You will feel that its some sort of Sweets outlet come restaurant because of the kind of decor, lightnings, crockeries they use to serve food on and all those kinda food hoardings they have. Maybe thats why they call it a quickie! Food - Strictly average. We ordered Murgh Tandoori, Murgh Malai kabab, Paneer tikka and Veg seekh kebab for appetizers. The taste was just okay, sorry to say but i think its same as what we would get in a cheap dhaba (as per taste). For mains we ordered Veg & chicken biryani, Punjabi by nature special mutton dish, Dal makhanai, Lahori paneer and Lachcha Paranthas. Sadly, all this turned out to be let down. I would say the starters were better. But i would say that the Dal Makhani was really nice but am a non veggie so it wont give me a reason to visit here again. I just happened to taste it from my friend's platter. My vegeterian friends were okay with the food but not impressed. But me and my non veggie friends were really disappointed. From 5p to 8p they have Happy hours during which only the Beer stands 1 plus 1, nothing else. I believe its 5p or maybe starts early (not sure on this). Service- This is the only thing which was GOOD! But in the end getting the check was a task. They took quite long to get it maybe because of customers walkin. This is also gives me a reason to doubt their service as when we went there the restaurant was kinda free maybe thats why the service was fast, LOL. So it is probably a fine option for Vegetarians but for sure not for meat eaters like me. Next, your turn!. Thank you for reading my review. :)",Rated 2.5,30,7,??

Samyak Ranjan,"Rated The ""Quickie"" version of the popular Punjabi by Nature, it's located in F block on the road which leads to Janpath. The place isn't that big and it won't give you a big feel of a fine dine, but it is quite decent and well made. We ordered the Amritsari Jumbo Chhole Bhature with a Family Dosa. Being a group of 5, we thought this would suffice. Now some things to take note would be that when they say 'Family', they mean it. The dosa is huge which covered almost our entire table and I think can easily serve 3-4 for a proper full meal. They bring the dosa and put it on the table and bring individual 'masala' and sambhar for each of us. Well being a Punjabi food restaurant, I had my doubts for this, and I was right. The dosa was not good. Or at least the combination wasn't. Basically it was the sambhar which destroyed the meal. The dosa, masala and the white coconut chutney were still good! The Jumbo Chhole Bhature, contrary to the dosa, won't serve a huge group. It's jumbo granted, but equivalent to about 2 bhature's. Oh and they'll serve such a small bowl of chhole you almost definetly can't finish it and you'll have to ask for more chhole which are (chargeable). But I didn't quite mind it as it was just amazing!The chhole were served hot so I had to settle for about a minute before I could devoured each bit. Well so overall I think it just did justice to the Punjabi food, but the South Indian was a disappointment. Recommended to order Chhole Bhature! Although I'd take my chances with the regular one. The service was prompt and our server was polite.

A few more visits later, I think it will be right for me to say that this place does not try to do too many things. Instead, whatever it does, it does pretty well. The menu is limited but the quality of food served here is great. To begin with, the limited drinks that they offer are good. The 'thalis' are pretty good too and gives us an idea of the variety of flavors they can offer. From the subtle flavors of a Murg Makhani to the extravaganza of flavors in the Meat Punjabi by Nature. The kebabs and dal makhani have a great taste to them. You would even love the basic steamed rice that they have to offer.

Apart from d the lahori paneer masala. It was just basically masala with lots of oil and some tiny pieces of paneer.

We tried fish tikka , a family masala dosa @ Virgin Mojito .fish was yummy so do the dosa .I never expected masala dosa to be that big ,it was almost 4.5 fit long and worth for money,As they serve only beer and breeze's,drinks options are very limited.staff is courteous &helpful especially Mr Rajeev (manager).

Sanya Dhall,Rated Being punjabi..I expected a lot More. But it was a disappointing experience. I went with my Family to this place. Ok honestly. It is a crowded place. So we had to wait for at least 10-15mins for The vacant Table. .but anyhow obviously Nice ambience. Nice decorum. Everything perfect.but Food was ordinary. Nothing so special about it...and Offcourse Slow service. Taste and Quality of Food you serve is more important obviously. .not the ambience of a place. Soo it was a average place..,Rated 3.5,10,38,??

Shweta Sachdeva,"Rated The big places always intimidate me, what with their fancy dining and their prices (especially the prices, you feel it the most when you're just a student). But this place surprised me in the best possible way! The ambience is gorgeous and has ample seating place to suit any occasion. The staff was helpful and courteous; the service quick and laudable. I loved the decor- it was sophisticated and captivating. As far as the food goes, I became smitten with PBN! We ordered a Thali with Dal Makhani, Murg masala (not exactly sure) and Rumali Roti. I ordered an Aam Panna too. From the first bite itself, I was a fan. The dedication and love that Punjabis cook with, simply shone through the food. The rotis were soft and the Dal... Well let's just say, I was licking my hands by the end of it! You don't feel the pinch when the food shows the passion and love with which it is made. That's all a foodie wants! My apprehensions and reservations about this place were thrown out of the window completely! I look forward to visiting them again this Winter! UPDATE: Coming here in the sweltering Delhi heat was a pleasure in itself! The quality remains spectacular. And I love how everything goes with the theme. This time our order of Chicken Biryani and a Kebab Platter (accompanied with a Naan and their lip-smacking Dal Makhani) did not at all disappoint! I would recommend that get Dal Makhani per person, otherwise you'll have everyone eating out of yours! ;)",Rated 4.0,74,152,??

An Ordinary Diner,"Rated PBN is my all time favourite and this ""Quickie"" concept adds perfect twist. When one is short on time and have a fussy group of eaters, Thalis always come handy.

Deepti Kumra,"Rated Yes! Punjabi by nature quickie is like a cheaper version of THE punjabi by nature.. The prices do vary.. But the quality, taste and quantity is as good as their main branches! I went there on a weekday afternoon and it was completely stacked up with people luckily with only one table empty which we were able to occupy without any waiting! The restaurant has a good interior with a nice seating arrangement. The ambiance was good with more of a family crowd as you would expect from a typical north indian restaurant! Staff and service- the service was a little slow and we were served with the wrong order first which a bit disappointing.. The staff was friendly.. But they can still work on their service.. Food- Amritsari fish tikka: it was very tasty but the flavour of fish was somehow missing.. One couldn't really tell that it was fish that we were eating.. So i think they should work on this dish and not let the original flavour of the fish die in their cooking. Jaljeera- it was amazing! A tint of spicyness reached your throat and i really liked that. Punjabi chicken masala- amazing!!!! The thick gravy was just perfect with the roti and naan but one would prefer a lighter gravy to eat with rice.. Garlic naan- crispy and yummy! Lachha parantha- i am not a big fan of the parantha but it was fairly decent to eat..",Rated 4.0,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place
Ankur Agrawal,Rated A good value for money deal. At a price with taxes if Rs 350 /- all thali combos are worth it. One thali is more than sufficient for a person and is quite filling. The combos made are though divided on choice of meat - chicken or mutton. Tip : Thalis can have a little mix n match variance serving chicken starters with mutton main course and vice versa. (In the thali) The prices are kept way lower than the normal PBN outlets snatching off the quantities a bit but not the flavours. Galouti kebabs were still the show stealers.,Rated 4.0,28,196,??

Ambience is just normal. Nothing special. Only the falling water on right is pretty. Ordered kadhai paneer and tandoori chicken. Thought tandoori chicken will have 4 pieces atleast. Ordered drinks. Beer for me. We got served with drinks first. As usual. Beer was 330 ml ????. Okay. So we waited for food. And after a while. Food was served. Tandoori chicken ? Wtf ? Full tandoori chicken had 2 pieces. Just 2 ! Man. That was unacceptable. Then we had to order butter chicken. Again had 2 pieces. Tandoori chicken looked like a weak chicken. And butter chicken had sweet gravy. Which I hate. Paneer was fine. Mango lassi wasn't great either. Cranberry breezer was not what they made. So it was good too. And jalzeera was fine too. Anyways. Tandoori chicken tasted good even though didn't have much to eat. But tasted fine. I don't think I'll be going there again. It was a match day. Ind vs WI. So we did have a good time watching that.

The menu has variety of cuisines but you will find only your favourite dishes form these cuisines in the menu. We ordered chefs special starters and they were good. In main course we ordered butter chicken and garlic naan and they were just awesome. The quantity is less if you are a foodie. A portion of dish is sufficient only for one person. The chicken was very soft and gravy was yummy. The size of bhature is of that of a football. Cholle Bhature is also a decent option to have. You will get really cheap domestic drinks if you go in happy hours. The staff is very friendly. The manger escorted us to our table.

As soon as I entered this place,i found the ambience good enough.. dim lights,nice decor etc etc. Etc Etc because there's nothing else which I can mention when it comes to ambience. We were sweating because we had walked a bit and the cooler in there wasn't functional,the AC was almost non-functional! 2ndly there were just 2 waiters attending to everyone present over there,so I wouldn't blame the waiter for the trouble I had to face to order what I had to. I wouldn't blame the waiter for every time calling them for a glass of water! I'd also not like to blame them for the almost non-functional AC! The only part I enjoyed there was the FOOD. I had ordered a ""Makkey da Kebab"" which was delicious! I had also ordered a ""Thandi Kheer""+ ""Rasmalai"" & both were super cool! Therefore,overall I would not like to visit Pind Balluchi(Connaught place) again with my friends/family & would also recommend ya'll not to go here.",Rated 3.0,6,82,??

Anurag Sharma,"Rated This time it was PBN Quickie's turn. First off, I love PBN, but I will try to keep this review as unbiased as possible. We had ordered Amritsari Chhole Bathura (not bathure), Chicken Tikka Roll, Aam Panna and Jaljeera. The food was delicious and ample. The bathura was big enough to fit three bathure in it. The chhole and rolls were a little short of bliss, but maybe we were not hungry. The drinks were ordinary as if it was just some squash mixed with water. There was no authenticity in the drinks we ordered. The Lassi would've been better. The ambience was like a place where you would grab a bite and skedaddle, in a good way. Good number of seating available. The pricing is the usual PBN price, but definitely worth it. So, do check it out if you are in the mood for some Indian flavour (they have South Indian too).

Soon we were provided a seating but i wanted a better place and the staff was courteous and attentive enough to shift me to a table of my liking twice. We ordered express thali 5 & 8 and true to its name ""Quickie"" , our orders were served really quick. The food was really good, on par with its chain, specially dal makhani and paneer makhani. Pricing makes it a great place to eat. Unlike its chain this one is not at all heavy on the pocket. Surely recommend it and a place to be visited again.",Rated 4.5,4,20,??

Surya Gadde,"Rated I went with my friend with great expectations. We booked the table and then got our turn in 20mins. I ordered an express thali 2 and a chicken biryani as the waiter said biryani is very gud. As I know how an actual Hyderabadi biryani is, I didn't expect biryani to be like that. But the worst thing is that biryani was nothing but some oiled jeera rice in which half cooked chicken pieces were put. No masala was added to the chicken. Then I thought I'd eat the thali which is equally pathetic. Dal was tasteless. Rice is hard. Only thing gud was the Gulab jamun and curd. And coming to service,the waiters were too busy arranging the tissues on an empty table when I called. He's responding like""yeah dude ! I'm coming just wait"". I waited for 10mins to get an extra spoon. Pathetic experience.",Rated 2.0,5,16,??

Tanya Dwivedi,"Rated I was looking for a quick lunch, not overly pricey and with good ambience. Punjabi by nature- Quickie just fit the bill! Pleasant entry with running water feature on one wall. The dcor was pleasing to the eyes except the gigantic posters of food which made it look like Haldiram's or Bangla foods type. Not that they are bad either in terms of food but other elements in its dcor just didn't match with that kind of image. We ordered Veg. Galouti Kebab which were nice and tasted nicer with the amazing green chutney, Aam Panna which was okayish and Chhanch which was fresh. We ordered Lahori Masala Paneer and Naans- Butter and garlic. The quantity was sufficient and we were almost stuffed. The Lahori Masala Paneer was succulent with fresh Paneer while the naans had a great texture and were evenly cooked. The service was prompt and with a smile. The service charges pushed the bill on the higher side though. I would like to go to Punjabi by Nature Quickie again and try other stuff.",Rated 4.5,7,8,??

Priyali Prakash,"Rated Amazing place for fine dining with a not-so-lavish budget! The interiors and decor are beautiful and the music is good too. We ordered a non veg platter so that we could have a taste of everything. And even though it was a non veg platter, the hero for us was Daal Makhani. Authentic punjabi flavors were brought out wonderfully well. The mutton was tender and succulent, in a spicy gravy. The peshawari kebabs tasted almost like regular seekh kebabs. We also ordered a chicken biryani and a hot chocolate fudge. The fudge was ordinary- regular vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce. Though the biryani somewhat let us down with the onions in it being too sweet. All in all, a decent fine dining experience that cost us just Rs. 800 for two people!

Start with the look of it, it looks like a good upmarket restaurant. Second question is the price, guys its damn neat for the quality and quantity they serve you. Food is fingerlicious. Service... Amazing. The staff is highly amicable and friendly. That is one thing in many that I like about this place. Always seen the staff with a smile. Who will not like to go to such a friendly place. That is I think their USP cause good food and ambiance is promised by many, but such a courteous staff I have seen only at this place. Kudos to the staff, owner, whole of the team. It lives up to its promise of a quickie and yet manages to have good variety of food. Their Dal Makni and Lassi never disappoints you a bit, justifying the traditional recipe. Where dal has perfect masala, kewara in lassi adds to the experience. And look of the Cholla Bhatura they serve... It takes your breath away. A Must Try. Their breads are good again in terms of size as well as prepration... Try anything Naan, Lachhaa Paratha, Missi or Tandoori Roti. In deserts, must try are their soft gulab jamuns and delicious kulfi.",Rated 5.0,24,33,??
Gurvinder Singh,"Rated Its been sometime since PBNQ opened shop in CP and i had been seeking an opportunity to visit the ""quickie"" version and one such opportunity presented itself on Sunday. Staff is nice and courteous. Even though there was a waiting my friend and i were seated near the beautiful water feature and were given menus to explore, which not a lot of places do. So well done for that! About 10 minutes later we are escorted to the tables and we placed our order. Both of us being veggies we chose the safety of paneer makhani, and breads we chose lacchedar paratha and stuffed paratha. We also ordered Dahi ke Kabeb for starters which were crispy and succulent...simply delicious, however, i was surprised by the portions. 5 peices for 2 people? unfair! The main course quickly arrived and we savored every morsel. the stuffed paratha was really stuffed and lacchedar paratha was flaky and the quantity of ghee was generous. The paneer was polished off immediately the gravy was thick and tasteful and paneer was really soft. All in all the the place packs a bang for your buck.

Hence i booked my table for 1 pm and managed to drop in on time. Parking was not at all a problem and i got easy parking in block F itself. Ambiance was good.. It was little hot in the restaurant as they had just switched on the Air conditioners and hence we had to unwillingly change our seat. As today was janamshtami..

Curd tikka infact tasted sour and the only saviour was dal makhni served along with the platter. The worst experience was Amritsari Chole Bature. The batura was completely drenched in oil.

Kritika Sharma,"Rated Punjabi By Nature Quickie is an absolute delight! We went there to have their humongous bhature which were actually larger than we had imagined. Size of bhatura: good for 2-3 people. Yes! And two of us wanted to eat it but others had to come to our rescue :P Chhole bhature were very good! Next we had dahi ke kebab, a specialty of this place. They were soft, slightly sour (from dahi) and rich in flavors. they serve 5 pieces in a plate and they are decently sized and well worth it. As we were five people, we decided to try out different things. A veg kebab platter came with two pieces each of dahi ke kebab, paneer tikka and tandoori aloo with a bowl of dal makhni and a nan. Paneer tikka was good and tasted of smoke, hence made it all the more yum. Tandoori aloo was also surprisingly good! Not only aloo well grilled but the stuffing of crushed paneer made it really stand out. A combo of masala dosa, wada and basundi. They serve it with three different south indian chutneys. Dosa was better than most of the south indian restaurants that we rave about with delicious sambhar and great chutneys. Its rare when we find all the components of this dish good! Surprisingly its a north indian restaurant that we shall now turn for our dosas :) And yes wada was light, soft and not full of oil. Main course was: Dal makhni: very good. Lahori masala paneer: A different take of kadhai paneer. I didn;t find it great but others at my table did. What was different was the gravy. Dessert: Basundi: a rich rabdi with malai and dry fruits. I am in love with this dish here. Ambiance: Its ambiance certainly doesnt say quickie. Its well lit, well spaced out tables and an eye to cleanliness. What more do we want. Staff: Very cordial and polite. Service: It can be a bit slow as the place is generally full! Overall: It is a must visit place if you are in CP!",Rated 4.0,99,491,??

Devansh Gilani,"Rated An outlet by punjabi by nature where you can have awesome food but at lower rates than the main outlet of punjabi by nature. Punjabi by nature quickie is located in the F block of Connaught Place. This restaurant may not be packed with people but surely you will have to wait for 5-10 minutes to get yourself a table. Talking about the dishes they have to offer.. Well on our visit to this place we ordered express thali 1 and express thali 5, well I should say that the taste of the dishes like murgh punjabi masala, dal makhani and mixed veg was really phenomenal, I like to eat hot and spicy so I particularly liked the murgh punjabi masala, however the raita tastes average as it had excess of salt in it. To drink we had mango lassi and aam panna, the mango lassi was a little too thick but aam panna tasted fresh and refreshing. The quantity of the food in such a price bracket is good and enough for one person. My overall experience regarding the food was very good and I hope that these kind of restaurant open in CP more often. Coming to the ambiance... The ambiance of the place is good, the music and the waterfall inside the restaurant is nice. I wonder that these waterfalls are so in these days I have seen them at many places now. The place is neat and clean and you can have a good dining experience here :). Pricey....? I would say that the quantity of the food that they are providing (specially in thalis) is fine as the quality of the dishes is also maintained. I wont mind spending 255 bucks for a thali that can satisfy my hunger and the dishes taste good. So I would say that the pricing is fine. Overall would be...

Neha Mishra,"Rated A few months ago Punjabi by Nature Quickie opened up in Connaught place and the name itself was explanatory of what it was offering. What it didnt tell us that a regular concept of quick dining could be so well managed and worth it. After an extended shopping session at CP we were hurriedly moving to Dominoes when we spotted this on the way and instantly decided to try it. We were greeted by a man at the gate, who I suppose was also the manager since he took care of every minute detail around. After waiting for two minutes we found a table and instantly were handed a menu in our hands. The menu was not very lavish but had all essential elements- both vegetarian and non vegetarian. Their value meals, which they call as platters are of four kinds with different variations. We decided to go with the option that had masala chicken along with other things. The meal included- Dal Makhni, Rice, Naan, a Tandoori Chicken Leg piece, Masala Chicken and Gulab Jamun- enough for two people. However out of curiosity we also ordered a plate of Biryani. The Biryani was too spicy. The best dish in terms of taste and flavour was Dal Makhni. It was undoubtedly one of the best Ive had till date. The service is quick and the staff responsive. A great bet for a quick meal with family/ friends also not very heavy on pocket. Our meal cost us around 650 bucks and was totally worth the money.

Sajeev Jayarajan,"Rated I had taken out my family to Punjabi by Nature for my birthday last week and will say that this will be just a 'one time fling'... My thoughts on the whole experience : 1. Ambience & Upkeep (5 out of 5) : The restaurant is tastefully furnished and is subtle without too much ostentation. Noise levels are comfortable - not so noisy that having a conversation is impossible nor so quiet that you are even afraid to exhale. The wash rooms are spotlessly clean and chic. 2. Food (2 out of 5) : This is the real problem with Punjabi by Nature - the lack of consistency across the items. Two of the items are really outstanding - dahi kababs and fish tikka (4 out of 5). The other kababs - chicken tandoori, seekh kabab, Peshawari kabab were okay (3 out of 5). As a south Indian who has lived in Delhi for 40 year, two dishes define whether a restaurant can have the right to call itself ""Punjabi"" - Dal Makhani and Butter chicken and these two dishes were not average but absolutely substandard... The dal makhani got the consistency right however the overwhelming taste of ginger wrecks it totally - I have had better in dhabas and the Bikanervala in Naraina serves dal makhani which is so lip smackingly delicious that you will reach for the last few drops with a piece of nan... The butter chicken was not butter chicken except if you have a vivid imagination and had a sour taste with no hint of butter/cream - you want to taste good butter chicken then Karim's (Saket), Bridges (Rajinder Nagar) serve fab butter chicken... Even their next door neighbour Kabab Express serves much better butter chicken... 3. Service (2 out of 5) : This problem is now cropping up in a lot of restaurants that have service charges (tip) as part of the bill... After going in we waited for 10 minutes before I ""caught"" the waiter's eye and got the menus... Same thing was repeated for taking the orders... My dad had sore throat so I asked if they could get a soda lemon at room temperature and they said yes... When it comes it is chilled and when I point it out they said they could mix water to reduce the chill (hmmm if I had wanted Nimbu paani I would have asked for it!!!)... Only half the ordered food gets delivered and when I give them a chiding 10 minutes later the remaining half is delivered.... Management : While I understand that Delhi might have its share of lousy tippers, please understand that a tip is for exceptional service... Stop thinking like Indian politicians and treat the tip as a ""reservation"" even in cases where service is lethargic... The fixed tip leads to typical slouch like one sees in government office.... The bill for 4 of us came to around Rs 2800 - similar food at Kabab Expess came to around Rs 1100... I see no reason why an average individual should pay double when both the food and service are abysmal... If you truly want a quickie then head out to Kabab Express and if you want a more elaborate fare of kababs then head out to good old Barbeque Nation...",Rated 2.0,13,15,??
Karan!!!,Rated They might be small when compared to the other outlets but they are definitely not small on their taste. Brilliant decor & ambience makes it a luxury outlet. The prices are not that high & can be afforded by most of the society. Their 'murgh makhani' is a delight to eat along with their crisp naan. The staff is courteous & alert. Their express Thalis are really ' express' as they are tasty yet economical. This is a great place to catch a quick meal.,Rated 4.0,80,82,??
Pragya Varma,"Rated As compared to its other outlets,it really economical. I had their non-veg thali with Dal Makhani( loved the taste of butter), One piece of tandoori chicken,rice,Raita,Kadhai Chicken,Naan and salad in just 245 rupees + taxes.But it was so tasty in such a economical rate and great quality.

Fully packed, the place don't offer a large menu to pick from but had some decent options. Talking about the food, it really turned out good. We ordered Kasturi kebab & Paneer Tikka for the starters and Kasturi scores a full. Stuffed chicken with mildly spiced coating was just lip smacking. Moving to the main course chicken punjabi and and a chef special mutton turned out equally well. The place though lacks some serving quickness but dosen't matter much if you to stay back and enjoy food.. So the place is worth a visit.",Rated 4.0,80,209,??

Ekam,"Rated I was planning to visit this good looking restaurant since the time my brother told me about it's delicious food. So I went there to try it out myself. As I approached the restaurant firstly I was amazed by the packed house and I had to wait for like 15 minutes to get a table for 2. Been through that every other thing just was up to standards. Nice decor inside , good staff .. So we ordered one of there thali's along with aloo ka parantha and I have to say I enjoyed my meal and felt content. Only thing which I didn't like was that the paneer served in thali was just a little bit sweet to taste. Dal makahani was very good , same for aloo ka parantha and the hot hot naan that they served with thali. But the best was yet to be ordered for my sweet tooth and we ordered firni.. :) Have to say it was one of the best one's I had in a long while.. Every bit of it was full of taste.. All in all a good place to enjoy food and decent on pocket compared to other restaurants in cp. PS. - This is my first ever review. Yay :)",Rated 4.0,16,16,??

Ankush Mohanty,"Rated Oh! What a place Mughlai food lovers out there dont fear when Punjabi by Nature (PBN) Quickie is here.. PBN considered as the epitome of Mughlai cuisine for a very long time has been trying to re-invent themselves in various ways in the past few months. They have started offering Student discounts, Special Happy Hours apart from the regular ones. These gimmicks showed that the once the connoisseur of Mughlai food is trying hard to get back its customers. However, whatever said and done, their food quality is still the same Lipsmackingly good. Wary of the fact that a word Quickie was mention with PBN, a quick internet check ensured that it is a genuine extension of the regular PBN chain of restaurants. Decked up in the same hue and colors just like the original, PBN Quickie has huge billboards advertizing its USP Economical Rates..! with dishes starting from 125 INR. So assuming the obvious that with dipping prices, the taste and quality would also be affected, we ordered tentatively. We started with Gulawati Kebabs (minced mutton kebabs adorned with spices), and what a start it was ; they surely justified their names (Gulawati Melt in your mouth)and perished as soon as they came. Having said that, the kebabs could have been softer since out of the 5 pieces, 2 were little dense as compared to the other ones. It would have been great to add some much needed texture to the dish. Having gained our confidence, there was no stopping us. We added the highly preferred Dal Makhni (Black Dal), Chicken Biryani and Butter Naans. Let me tell you, the butter naans are not for the faint hearted. Its like Heart Attack served on a plate. If you decide to enter such a place, please keep behind all inhibitions for a truly memorable meal. The Dal Makhani was truly rich and heavy. The gravy was thick to the T and it combined well with the butter dipped crispy naans. Ohh, I would so love to go back and have that combination. The chicken biryani with the spices garnished on top was a welcome change from the other varieties being offered at different restaurants. We were a bit apprehensive when the biryani was placed on the table wih the saalan or a raita not present. The first bite dissolved all those doubts as the biryani isnt dry at all. The chicken pieces were succulent and tender. With all this, the bill came out to be Rs. 670 and then with taxes the total was Rs. 1080..! Yes, you should not be mistaken; it really offers the same taste with better prices. So dont go here for a Quickie but for a quality time well spent with family / friends with a lavish spread waiting to be devoured. I was too distracted by the food to take snaps.. :)",Rated 4.5,103,370,??

Stuffed Paratha, Garlic Nan, Lachchedar Paratha - Very delicious! Pineapple Raita - Regular accompaniment. Good. Fresh Lime with Soda, Aam Panna - Horrible. Avoid drinks at this restaurant.

The dal makhani was best I had in a long time, chicken was fairly good and the gulaab jamoon was decently satisfying. In all the food was a satisfaction after taking 4 rounds of the inner circle. The most attractive part of the food was it tasted punjabi. Impressed, not excited. Recommended...",Rated 3.5,70,545,??
Sandy,"Rated What an aptly name restaurant. QUICKIE. The experience here will certainly make you feel like you just had a ""quickie"" [hopefully you'll get what i'm referring to ;) 1. The Chance encounter - Roaming around CP some time back, we noticed opening of a new restaurant. Since everyone among us had visited Punjabi By Nature multiple times so the name quickly registered into our minds. 2. The Flirting - Since we were in a hurry that day so we decided to check this place out some other day. After that, 2-3 times we crossed its door but were never able to go inside for some reason or another. But the craving was very much there. Firstly because of the nicely done interiors, well groomed staff and mainly because of the quality of food one associates with the name PBN. 3. The Encounter - After missing out on multiple occasions and getting more & more enticed by the place everytime we walked by it, finally came the day we checked it out. The experience was just like a ""quickie"". Went in, got served, came out, All within 15 minutes :P We ordered just two dishes initially, to check out the food - veg kebab platter & amritsari chhole bhature. While the portions in platter were disappointingly small; size of bhatura was nonsensically large. Whats the point of serving a bhatura of a size of UFO i fail to understand. It went cold and thus inedible even before we were done halfway through it. Also the taste of all the items was pretty bland. Disappointing!!!! 4. The Dash - As soon as we were finished with our meal, manager came to our table. Conversation with him reminded me of the awkward after-doing-IT-talk. We just answered nervously & quickly, eager to go out. Which was exactly what we did as soon as he left. This was one ""quickie"" which has absolutely no scope of turning into a long term relationship :P In short, Wham Bam NO Thank You PBN :D",Rated 2.5,0,0,Expert in Connaught Place

Varun Gupta,"Rated Even without getting to food (which was below average as well), I would strongly suggest people to AVOID this restaurant. One of the most pathetic services I have seen, led by arrogant staff. The concept of service doesn't really exist! Waited for the bill for around 50 mins, even after asking for it multiple times. Asked for hand wash bowls and they gave it for 2 people out of 8.. We were amazed what was going on- the staff didn't seem interested in listening and would say they would come to us soon. After we got tired of waiting for over 50 mins, we decided to leave and when we got out of the gate, one of the staff members ran to us with the bill. We requested to speak to the manager ""Rajiv"" who was worst of the lot. He started shouting on how we can leave, and said we never requested for the bill. The staff, especially the on-duty manager was so arrogant, I would never visit this place again, nor recommend this to anyone else.

It's called quickie because they claim to have fast service (which they live up to), and being a branch of Punjabi by Nature, food is absolutely delicious. I don't know if the prices are promotional, but it's quite light on the pocket (huge surprise!). The menu is a little limites, but I cannot complain about the food which was exquisit. The Amritsari Chole Bature, Dahi kebabs, and non veg platter- just YUM. Ambiance- small, but top notch.
